POLL, strictly the head, in men or animals. Skeat connects 
the word with O. Swed. kolle (initial p and k being interchange- 
able)iand considers a Celtic origin probable; cf. Irish coll, Welsh 
coly peak, summit. . " Poll " is chiefly used in various senses 
derived from that of a unit in an enumeration of persons or 
things, e.g. poll-tax (q.v.), or "challenge to the polls " in the case 
of a jury (q.v.). The most familiar derivative uses are those 
connected with voting at parliamentary or other elections; 
thus " to poll " is to vote or to secure a number of votes, and 
" the poll," the voting, the number of votes cast, or the time 
during which voting takes place. The verb " to poll " also 
means to clip or shear the top of anything, hence " polled " of 
hornless cattle, or " deed-poll " (i.e. a deed with smooth or 
unindented edges, as distinguished from an " indenture "). 
A tree which has been " polled," or cut back close in order to 
induce it to make short bushy growth, is called a " pollard." 

At the university of Cambridge, a " pass " degree is known as 
a '* poll-degree." This is generally explained as from the Greek 
ol iroWol, the many, the common people. 

POLLACK (Gadus pollachius), a fish of the family Gadidae, 
abundant on rocky coasts of northern Europe, and extending as 
far south as the western parts of the Mediterranean, where, 
however, it is much scarcer and does not attain to the same size 
as in its real northern home. 'In Scotland and some parts of 
Ireland it is called lythe. It is distinguished from other species 
of the genus Gadus by its long pointed snout, which is twice 
as long as the eye, with projecting lower jaw, and without a 
barbel at the chin. The vent is below the anterior half of the 
first dorsal fin. A black spot above the base of the pectoral 
fin is another distinguishing mark. Although pollack are well- 
flavoured fish, and smaller individuals (from 12 to 16 in.) 
excellent eating, they do not form any considerable article of 
trade, and are not preserved, the majority being consumed by 
the captors. Specimens of 12 ib are common, but the species 
is said to attain occasionally as much as 24 lb in weight. (See 
also Coalfish.) 

POLLAIUOLO, the popular name of the brothers Antonio and 
Piero di Jacobo Benci, Florentines who contributed much to 
Italian art in the 15th century. They were called Pollaiuolo 
because their father was a poulterer. The nickname was also 
extended to Simone, the nephew of Antonio. 

Antonio (1429-1498) distinguished himself as a sculptor, 
jeweller, painter and engraver, and did valuable service in 
perfecting the art of enamelling. His painting exhibits an excess 
xxn. 1 



of brutality, of which the characteristics can be studied in the 
" Saint Sebastian," painted in 1475, and now in the National 
Gallery, London. A " St Christopher and the Infant Christ " 
is in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. But it was as a 
sculptor and metal-worker that he achieved his greatest suc- 
cesses. The exact ascription of his works is doubtful, as his 
brother Piero did much in collaboration with him. The museum 
of Florence contains the bronze group " Hercules strangling 
Cacus " and the terra-cot ta bust "The Young Warrior "; and 
in the South Kensington Museum, London, is a bas-relief 
representing a contest between naked men. In 1489 Antonio 
took up his residence in Rome, where he executed the tomb of 
Sixtus IV. (1493), a composition in which he again manifested the 
quality of exaggeration in the anatomical features of the figures. 
In 1496 he went to Florence in order to put the finishing touches 
to the work already begun in the sacristy of Santo Spirito. He 
died in 1498, having just finished his mausoleum "of Inno- 
cent VIII., and was buried in the church of San Pietro in 
Vincula, where a monument was raised to him near that of 
his brother. 

Piero (1 443-1 496) was a painter, and his principal works 
were his " Coronation of the Virgin," an altar-piece painted 
in 1483, in the choir of the cathedral at San Gimignano; his 
" Three Saints," an altar-piece, and " Prudence " are both at 
the Uffizi Gallery. 

Simone (1457-1508), nephew of Antonio Pollaiuolo, a cele- 
brated architect, was born in Florence and went to Rome in 
1484; there he entered his uncle's studio and studied architecture. 
On his return to Florence he was entrusted with the completion 
of the Strozzi palace begun by Benedetto de Maiano, and the 
cornice on the facade has earned him lasting fame. His highly 
coloured accounts of Rome earned for him the nickname of il 
Cronaca (chronicler). About 1498 he built the church of San 
Francesco at Monte and the vestibule of the sacristy of Santo 
Spirito. In collaboration with Guiliano da Sangallo he designed 
the great hall in the Palazzo Vecchio. He was a close friend 
and adherent of Savonarola.

POLLAN (Coregonus pollan), the name given to a species of 
the Salmonoid genus Coregoniis (whitefish) which has been found 
in the large and deep loughs of Ireland only. A full account of 
the fish by its first describer, \V. Thompson, may be found in his 
Natural History of Ireland, iv. 168.

POLLARD— POLLINATION 



POLLARD, EDWARD ALBERT (1828-1872), American 
journalist, was born in Nelson county, Virginia, on the 27th of 
February 1828. He graduated at the university of Virginia in 
1849, studied law at the College of William and Mary, and in 
Baltimore (where he was admitted to the bar), and was engaged 
in newspaper work in California until 1855. In 185 7-1 861 he 
was clerk of the judiciary committee of the National House of 
Representatives. By 1859 he had become an outspoken 
Secessionist, and during the Civil War he was one of the principal 
editors of the Richmond Examiner ', which supported the Con- 
federacy but was hostile to President Jefferson Davis. In 1864 
Pollard sailed for England, but the vessel on which he sailed 
was captured as a blockade runner, and he was confined in Fort 
Warren in Boston Harbour from the 29th of May until the 12th 
of August, when he was paroled. In December he was placed 
in close confinement at Fort Monroe by order of Secretary 
Stanton, but was soon again paroled by General B. F. Butler, 
and in January proceeded to Richmond to be exchanged there 
for Albert D. Richardson (1833-1869), a well-known corre- 
spondent of the New York Tribune, who, however, had escaped 
before Pollard arrived. In 1 867-1869 Pollard edited a weekly 
paper at Richmond, and he conducted the Political Pamphlet 
there during the presidential campaign of 1868. 

His publications include Black Diamonds Gathered in the Darkey 
Homes of the South (1859), in which he advocated a reopening of 
the slave trade ; The Southern History of the War (3 vols. : First 
Year of the War, with B. M. DeWitt, 1862; Second Year of the War, 
1864; Third Year of the War, 1864); Observations in the North: 
Eight Months in Prison and on Parole (1865) ; TJie Lost Cause (1866) ; 
Lee and His Lieutenants (1867); The Lost Cause Regained (1868), 
a southern view of reconstruction urging the necessity of white 
supremacy; The Life of Jefferson Davis (1869), an arraignment of 
the Confederate president; and The Virginia Tourist (1870). 

POLLENTIA (mod. Pollenzo), an ancient town of Liguria, 
Italy, 10 m. to the north of Augusta Bagiennorum, on the left 
bank of the Tanarus (mod. Tanaro). Its position on the road 
from Augusta Taurinorum to the coast at Vada Sabatia, at the 
point of divergence of a road to Hasta (Asti) gave it military 
importance. Decimus Brutus managed to occupy it an hour 
before Mark Antony in 43 B.C.; and it was here that Stilicho 
on the 29th of March 403 fought the battle with Alaric 
which though undecided led the Goths to evacuate Italy, 
The place was famous for its brown wool, and for its pottery. 
Considerable remains of ancient buildings, an amphitheatre, a 
theatre and a temple still exist. The so-called temple of Diana 
is more probably a tomb.

1808), p. 321 sqq. 

POLLINATION, in botany, the transference of the pollen from 
the stamen to the receptive surface, or stigma, of the pistil of a 
flower. The great variety in the form, colour and scent of 
flowers (see Flower) is intimately associated with pollination 
which is effected by aid of wind, insects and other agencies. 
Pollen may be transferred to the stigma of the same flower — - 
self-pollination (or autogamy) , or to the stigma of another flower 
on the same plant or another plant of the same species — cross- 
pollination (or allogamy). Effective pollination may also occur 
between flowers of different species, or occasionally, as in the 
case of several orchids, of different genera — this is known as 
hybridization. 

The method of pollination is to some extent governed by the 
distribution of the stamens and pistil. In the case of unisexual 
flowers, whether monoecious, that is, with staminate and pistillate 
flowers on one and the same plant, such as many of our native 
trees — oak, beech, birch, alder, &c, or dioecious with staminate 
and pistillate flowers on different plants, as in willows and pop- 
lars, cross pollination only is possible. In bisexual or herma- 
phrodite flowers, that is, those in which both stamens and pistil 
are present, though self-pollination might seem the obvious 
course, this is often prevented or hindered by various arrange- 
ments which favour cross-pollination. Thus the anthers and 
stigmas in any given flower are often mature at different times; 
this condition, which is known as dichogamy and was first 



pointed out by Sprengel, may be so well marked that the stigma 
has ceased to be receptive before the anthers open, or the anthers 
have withered before the stigma becomes receptive, when cross- 
pollination only is possible, or the stages of maturity in the two 
organs are not so distinct, when self-pollination becomes possible 
later on. The flower is termed proterandrous or proterogynous 
according as anthers or stigmas mature first. The term 
homogamy is applied to the simultaneous maturity of stigma and 
anthers. Spontaneous self-pollination is rendered impossible 
in some homogamous flowers in consequence of the relative 
position of the anthers and stigma — this condition has been 
termed herkogamy. Flowers in which the relative position of 
the organs allows of spontaneous self-pollination may be all 
alike as regards length of style and stamens (homomorphy or 
homostyly), or differ in this respect (keteromorphy) the styles

and stamens being of different lengths in different flowers 
(heterostyly) or the stamens only are of different lengths (heter- 
anthery). Flowers which are closed at the time of maturity of 
anthers and stigmas are termed cleistogamous. 

Self-pollination is effected in very various ways. In the 
simplest case the anthers are close to the stigmas, covering these 
with pollen when they open; this occurs in a number of small 
annual plants, also in Narcissus, Crocus, &c. In snowdrop and 
other pendulous flowers the anthers form a cone around the style 
and the pollen falls on to the underlying stigmas, or in erect 
flowers the pollen may fall on to the stigmas which lie directly 
beneath the opening anthers (e.g. Nafthecium), In very many 
cases the pollen is carried to the stigma by elongation, curvature 
or some other movement of the filament, the style or stigma, or 
corolla or some other part of the % flower, or by correlated move- 
ments of two or more parts. For instance, in many flowers 
the filaments are at first directed outwards so that self-pollina- 
tion is not possible, but later incline towards the stigmas and 
pollinate them (e.g. numerous Saxifragaceae, Cruciferae and 
others), or the style, which first projects beyond the anthers, 
shortens later on so that the anthers come into contact with the 
stigmas (e.g. species of Cactaceae), or the style bends so that the 
stigma is brought within the range of the pollen (e.g. species of 
Oenothera, Epilobium, most Malvaceae, &c). In Mirabilis Jalapa 
and others the filaments and style finally become intertwined, 
so that pollen is brought in contact with the stigma. Self- 
pollination frequently becomes possible towards the end of the 
life of a flower which during its earlier stages has been capable 
only of cross-pollination. This is associated with the fact, so 
ably demonstrated by Darwin, that, at any rate in a 
large number of cases, cross-pollination yields* better results, as 
measured by the number of seeds produced and the strength of 
the offspring, than self-pollination; the latter is, however, 
preferable to absence of pollination. In many cases pollen has 
no effect on the stigma of the same flower, the plants are self- 
sterile, in other cases external pollen is more effective (pre-pote?it) 
than pollen from the same flower; but in a very large number of 
cases experiment has shown that there is little or no difference 



POLLINATION 



between the effects of external pollen and that from the same 
flower. 

Cross-pollination may occur between two flowers on the same 
plant (geitonogamy) or between flowers on distinct plants 
(xenogamy). The former, which is a somewhat less favourable 
method than the latter, is effected by air-currents, insect 
agency, the actual contact between stigmas and anthers in 
neighbouring flowers, where, as in the family Compositae, 
flowers are closely crowded, or by the fall of the pollen from a

The dotted lines with the arrow show the directions in which 
pollen must be carried to each stigma to ensure full fertility. 

higher on to the stigmas of a lower flower. Anton Kerner has 
shown that crowded inflorescences such as those of Compositae 
and Umbelliferae are especially adapted for geitonogamy. 
Xenogamy is of course the only possible method in diclinous 
plants; it is also the usual method in monoclinous plants, owing 
to the fact that stamens and carpels often mature at different 
times (dichogamy), the plants being proterandrous or protero- 
gynous. Even in homogamous flowers cross-pollination is in a 
large proportion of cases the effective method, at any rate at 
first, owing to the relative position of anther and stigma or the 
fact that the plant is self-sterile. 

The subject of heterostyly was investigated by Darwin (see 
his Forms of Flowers) and later by Hildebrand. In the case of a 
dimorphic flower, such as Primula, four modes of pollination 
are possible, two distinguished by Darwin as le'gitimate, between 
anthers and stigmas on corresponding levels, and two so-called 
illegitimate unions, between anthers and stigmas at different 
levels (cf. fig. i). In a trimorphic flower such as Ly thrum 
salicaria there are six possible legitimate unions and twelve 
illegitimate (see fig. 2). Experiment showed that legitimate 
unions yield a larger quantity of seed than illegitimate. 



Many plants produce, in addition to ordinary open flowers, 
so-called cleistogamous flowers, which remain permanently 
closed but which notwithstanding 
produce fruit; in these the corolla is 
inconspicuous or absent and the pollen 
grows from the anther on to the 
stigma of the same flower. Species of 
Viola (see fig. 3), Oxalis acetosella 
(wood sorrel) and Lamium amplexi- 
caule are commonly occurring in- 
stances. The cleistogamous flowers 
are developed before or after the 
normal open flowers at seasons less 
favourable for cross-pollination. In 
some cases flowers, which open under 
normal circumstances, remain closed 
owing to unfavourable circumstances, 
and self-pollination occurs as in a F1G.3. — Cleistogamous 
typical cleistogamous flower — these flower of Viola sylvatica. 
have been distinguished as pseudo- *» f} ower X4. 
cleistogamous. Instances occur in ^SUTut^ 
water plants, where flowers 




"anther; s, pistil;

surface. 



are un- a , 
able to reach the surface (e.g. Alisma st, 
natans, water buttercup, &c.) or 
where flowers remain closed in dull or cold weather. 

Systems of classification of flowers according to the agency by 
which pollination is effected have been proposed by Delpino, 
H. Muller and other workers on the subject. Knuth suggests 
the following, which is a modification of the systems proposed by 
Delpino and Muller, 

A. Water-pollinated plants, Hydrophilae. A small group which is 

subdivided thus: — 

a. Pollinated under the water; e.g. Najas where the pollen grains 

are rather heavier than water, and sinking down are caught 
by the stigmas of the extremely simple female flowers. 

b. Pollination on the surface, a more frequent occurrence than 

(a). In these the pollen floats on the surface and reaches 
the stigmas of the female flowers as in Callitriche, Ruppia, 
Zostera, Elodea. In Vallisneria (fig. 4) the male flowers 
become detached and float on the surface of the water; 
t the anthers are thus brought in contact with the stigmas 
of the female flowers. 

B. Wind-pollinated plants, Anemophilae. — In these the pollen 

grains are smooth and light so as to be easily blown about, 
and are produced in great quantity; the stigmas are brush- 
like or feathery, and usually long and protruding so as readily 
to catch the pollen. As no means of attraction are required 
the flowers are inconspicuous and without scent or nectar. 
The male inflorescence is often a pendulous catkin, as in hazel 
and many native English trees (fig. 5); or the anthers are 
loosely fixed on long thread-like filaments as in grasses (fig. 6).

C. Animal-pollinated plants, Zoidiophilae, are subdivided according 

to the kind of animal by agency of which pollination is 

effected, thus: — 

a. Bat-pollinated, Chiropterophilae. — A Freycinetia, native of 

Java, and a species of Bauhinia in Trinidad are visited by 

bats which transfer the pollen.

b. Bird- pollinated f Ornithophilae. — Humming-birds and honey- 
suckers are agents of pollination in certain tropical plants; 
they visit the generally large and brightly-coloured flowers 
either for the honey which is secreted in considerable 
quantity or for the insects which have been attracted by 
the honey (fig. 7).

Snail or slug-pollinated flowers, Malacophilae. — In small 
flowers which are crowded at the same level or in flat 
flowers in which the stigmas and anthers project but little, 
slugs or snails creeping over their surface may transfer to 
the stigma the pollen which clings to the slimy foot. Such 
a transfer has been described in various Aroids, Rohdea 
japonica (Liliaceae), and other plants.

Docimastes ensiferus. (About i nat. size.) 

d. Insect-pollinated, Entomophilae, a very 
large class characterized by sticky 
pollen grains, the surface of which bears 
spines, warts or other projections (fig. 8) 
which facilitate adhesion to some part 
of the insect's body, and a relatively 
small stigma with a sticky surface. 
The flowers have an attractive floral 
envelope, are scented and often contain 
honey or a large amount of pollen; 
by these means the insect is enticed 
to visit it. The form, colour^ and 
scent of the flower vary widely, 
according to the class of insect whose

aid is sought, and there are also numerous devices for pro- 
tecting the pollen and nectar from rain and dew or 
from the visits of those insects which would not serve 
the purpose of pollen-transference (unbidden guests). 1 The 
following subdivisions have been suggested 

A. Pollen Flowers. — These offer only pollen to their visitors, 

as species of anemone, poppy, rose, tulip, &c. They 
are simple in structure and regular in form, and the 
generally abundant pollen is usually freely exposed. 

B. Nectar Flowers. — These contain nectar and include the 

following groups : — 

1. Flowers with exposed nectar, readily visible and accessible 

to all visitors. These are very simple, open and gener- 
ally regular flowers, white, greenish-yellow or yellow 
in colour and are chiefly visited by insects with a 
short proboscis, such as short-tongued wasps and flies, 
also beetles and more rarely bees. Examples are 
Umbelliferae as a family, saxifrages, holly, Acer, 
Rhamnus, Euonymus, Euphorbia, &c. 

2. Flowers with nectar partly concealed and visible only in 

bright sunshine. The ^ generally regular flowers are 
completely open only in bright sunshine, closing up 
into cups at other times. Such are most Cruciferae, 
buttercups, king-cup {Caltha), Potentilla. White and 
yellow colours predominate and insects with a pro- 
boscis of medium length are the common pollinating 
agents, such as short-tongued bees. 

3. Flowers with nectar concealed by pouches, hairs, &c. 

Regular flowers predominate, e.g. Geranium, Cardamine 
pratensis, mallows, Rubus, Oxalis, Epilobium, &c, but 
many species show more or less well-marked median 
symmetry (zygomorphism) as Euphrasia, Orchis, thyme, 
&c, and red, blue and violet are the usual colours. 
Long-tongued insects such as the honey-bee are the 
most frequent visitors. 

4. Social flowers, whose nectar is concealed as in (3), but the 

flowers are grouped in heads which render them 
strikingly conspicuous, and several flowers can be simul- 
taneously pollinated.^ Such are Compositae as a class, 
also Scabiosa, Armeria (sea-pink) and others. 

5. Hymenopterid flowers, which fall into the following groups: 

Bee-flowers proper, humble-bee flowers requiring a 
longer proboscis to reach the nectar, wasp-flowers such 
as fig-wort (Scrophularia nodosa) and ichneumon 
flowers such as t way-blade (Listera ovata). 

The shapes and colours are extremely varied; bilater- 
ally symmetrical forms are most frequent with red, 
blue or violet colours. Such are Papilionaceous 
flowers, Violaceae, many Labiatae, Scrophulariaceae 
and others. Many are highly specialized so that 
pollination can be effected by a few species only. 
Examples of more special mechanisms are illustrated 
by Salvia (fig. 9). The long connective of the single 
stamen is hinged to the short filament and has a shorter 
arm ending in a blunt process and a longer arm bearing 
a half-anther. A large bee in probing for honey comes 
* in contact with the end of the short arm of the lever 
and causes the longer arm to descend and the pollen 
is deposited on the back of the insect (fig. 9, 1). In a 
later stage (fig. 9, 2) the style elongates and the forked 
stigma occupies the same position as the anther in 
fig. 9. 1.

In Broom there is an explosive machanism; the 
pressure of the insect visitor on the keel of the corolla 
cause's a sudden release of the stamens and the scatter- 
ing of a cloud of pollen over its body. 
6. Leptdopterid flowers, visited chiefly by Lepidoptera, 
which are able to reach the nectar concealed in deep, 
narrow tubes or spurs by means 
of their long slender proboscis. 
Such are: (a) Butterfly-flowers, 
usually red in colour, as 
Dianthus carthusianorum; t (b) 
Moth-flowers, white or whitish, 
as honeysuckle (Lonicera 
periclymenum). 
7. Fly flowers, chiefly visited by 
Diptera, and including very 
different types: — 

a. Nauseous flowers, dull and 
yellowish and dark purple in 
colour and often spotted, with 
a smell attractive to carrion 
flies and dung flies, e,g. species 
of Saxifraga. 

b. Pitfall flowers such as Asarum, 
Aristolochia and Arum macu- 
latum, when the insect is 
caught and detained until 
pollination is effected (fig. 
10). 

c. Pinch-trap flowers, as In the 
family Asclepiadaceae, where 
the proboscis, claw or bristle 
of the insect is caught in the 
clip^ Jo which the pairs of 
pollinia are attached. Bees, 
wasps and larger insects serve 
as pollinating agents

with radiating streaks pointing to a sharply-defined 
centre in which is the nectar, as in Veronica ckamaedrys 
(fig. 12). 
Literature.— Joseph Gottlieb Kolreuter l (d. 1806) was the first 
to study the pollination of flowers and to draw attention to the 
necessity of insect visits in many cases; he 
gave a clear account of cross-pollination 
by insect aid. He was followed by Christian 
Konrad Sprengel, whose work Das entdeckte 
Geheimniss der Natur im Ban und in der 
Bejruchtung der Blumen (Berlin, 1733), 
contains a description of floral adaptations 
to insect visits in nearly 500 species of 
plants. Sprengel came very near to 
appreciating the meaning ol cross-pollina- 
tion in the lite of plants when he states 
that " it seems that Nature is unwilling 
that any flower should be fertilized by its 
own pollen." In 1799 an Englishman, (From Vines's Text Booh of 
Thomas Andrew Knight, after experiments _ ^n^by^mussion.) 
on the cross- fertilization of cultivated FlG - 12. — Flower ot 
plants, formulated the conclusion that no Veronica, 

plant fertilizes itself through many genera- k, Calyx, 
tions. Sprengel's work, which had been w, h, w> The three lobes 
almost forgotten, was taken up again by of the lower lip of 
Charles Darwin, who concluded that no the rotate corolla, 
organic being can fertilize itself through o, The upper lip, 
an unlimited number of generations; but s, s, The two stamens. 
a cross with other individuals is occasion- n t The stigma, 
ally — perhaps at very long intervals — indis- 
pensable. Darwin's works on dimorphic flowers and the fertiliza- 
tion of orchids gave powerful support to this statement. The 
study of the fertilization, or as it is now generally called " pollina- 
tion," of flowers, was continued by Darwin and taken up by other 
workers, notably Friedrich Hildebrand, Federico Delpino and the 
brothers Fritz and Hermann Muller. Hermann Muller's work on 
The Fertilization of Flowers by Insects and their Reciprocal Adapta- 
tions (1873), followed by subsequent works on the same lines, brought 
together a great number of observations on floral mechanisms and 
their relation to insect- visits. Muller also suggested a modification 
of the Knight-Darwin law, which had left unexplained the numer- 
ous instances of continued successful self-pollination, and restated 
it on these terms: " Whenever offspring resulting from crossing 
comes into serious conflict with offspring resulting from self- 
fertilization, the former is victorious. Only where there is no 
such struggle for existence does self-fertilization often prove satis- 
factory for many generations." An increasing number of workers 
in this field of plant biology in England, on the Continent and in 
America has produced a great mass of observations, which have 
recently been brought together in Dr Paul Knuth's classic work, 
Handbook of Flower Pollination, an English translation of which 
has been published (1908) by the Clarendon Press. 

POLLIO, GAIUS ASINIUS (76 b.c.-a.d. 5; according to some, 
75 b.c.-a.d. 4), Roman orator, poet and historian. In 54 he 
impeached unsuccessfully C. Porcius Cato, who in his tribunate 
(56) had acted as the tool of the triumvirs. In the civil war 
between Caesar and Pompey Pollio sided with Caesar, was 
present at the battle of Pharsalus (48), and commanded against 
Sextus Pompeius in Spain, where he was at the time of Caesar's 
assassination. He subsequently threw in his lot with M. 
Antonius. In the division of the provinces, Gaul fell to Antony, 
who entrusted Pollio with the administration of Gallia Trans- 
padana. In superintending the distribution of the Mantuah 
territory amongst the veterans, he used his influence to save 
from confiscation the property of the poet Virgil. In 40 he 
helped to arrange the peace of Bmndisium by which Octavian 
(Augustus) and Antonius were for a time reconciled. In the 
same year Pollio entered upon his consulship, which had been 
promised him in 43. It was at this time that Virgil addressed 
the famous fourth eclogue to him. Next year Pollio conducted 
a successful campaign against the Parthini, an Illyrian people 
who adhered to Brutus, and celebrated a triumph on the 25th 
of October. The eighth eclogue of Virgil w T as addressed to 
Pollio while engaged in this campaign. From the spoils of the 
war he constructed the first public library at Rome, in the 
Atrium Libertatis, also erected by him (Pliny, Nat. hisL xxxv. 
10), which he adorned with statues of the most celebrated

betreffenden Versuchen und Beobachtungen, 3, 4, 6 (Leipzig, 1761).

authors, both Greek and Roman. Thenceforward he withdrew 
from active life and devoted himself to literature. He seems to 
have maintained to a certain degree an attitude of independence, 
if not of opposition, towards Augustus. He died in his villa at 
Tusculum, regretted and esteemed by all. 

Pollio was a distinguished orator; his speeches showed ingenuity 
and care, but were marred by an affected archaism (Quintilian, 
Inst. x. I, 113; Seneca, Ep. 100). He wrote tragedies also, which 
Virgil (Eel. vhi. id) declared to be worthy of Sophocles, and a prose 
history of the civil wars of his time from the first triumvirate (60) 
down to the death of Cicero (43) or later. This history, in the 
composition of which Pollio received assistance from the grammarian 
Ateius Praetextatus, was used as an authority by Plutarch and 
ApDian (Horace, Odes, ii. 1 ; Tacitus, Annals, iv. 34). As a literary 
critic Pollio was very severe. He censured Sal lust (Suetonius, 
Gram. 10) and Cicero (Quintilian, Inst. six. 1, 22) and professed 
to detect in Livy's style certain provincialisms of his native Padua 
(Quintilian, i. 5, 56, viii. i, 3); he attacked the Commentaries^ of 
Julius Caesar, accusing their author of carelessness and credulity, 
if not of deliberate falsification (Suet. Caesar, 56). Pollio was the 
first Roman author who recited his writings to an audience of his 
friends, a practice which afterwards became common at Rome. 
The theory that Pollio was the author of the Bellum africanum, 
one of the supplements to Caesar's Commentarii, has met with little 
support. All his writings are lost except a few fragments of his 
speeches (H. Meyer, Oral. ram. frag. f 1842), and three letters 
addressed to Cicero (Ad. Fam. x. 31-33).

POLLNITZ, KARL LUDWIG, Freiherb. von (1692-1775), 
German adventurer and writer, was born at Issum on the 25th 
of February 1692. His father, Wilhclm Ludwig von Pollnitz 
(d. 1693), was in the military service of the elector of Branden- 
burg, and much of his son's youth was passed at the electoral 
court in Berlin. He was a man of restless and adventurous 
disposition, unscrupulous even for the age in which he lived, 
visited many of the European courts, and served as a soldier in 
Austria, Italy and Spain. Returning to Berlin in 1735 he 
obtained a position in the household of King Frederick William I. 
and afterwards in that of Frederick the Great, with whom he 
appears to have been a great favourite; and he died in Berlin on 
the 23rd of June 1775. 

Pollnitz's Mimoires (Liege, 1734), which were translated into 
German (Frankfort, 1735), give interesting glimpses of his life and 
the people whom he met, but they are very untrustworthy. He 
also wrote Nouveaux m&moires (Amsterdam, 1737); £tat abre'ge' de 
la cour de Saxe sous le regne oVAuguste III. (Frankfort, 1734; Ger. 
trans., Breslau, 1736); and MSmoires pour servir a Vhistoire des 
quatres derniers souverains de la maison de Brandenbourg, published 
by F. L. Brunn (Berlin, 1 791; Ger. trans., 1 Berlin, 1791). Per- 
haps his most popular works are La Saxe galante (Amsterdam, 
1734), an account of the private life of Augustus the Strong, elector 
of Saxony and king of Poland; and Histoire secrete de la duchesse 
d'Hanovre, Spouse de Georges I. (London, 1732). There is an 
English translation of the MSmoires (London, 1 738-1 739). See 
P. von Pollnitz, Stammtafeln der Familie von Pollnitz (Berlin, 
1894); and J. G. Droysen, Gesckichte der preussischen Politik, pt. iv. 
(Leipzig, 1870). 

POLLOCK, the name of an English family which has con- 
tributed many important members to the legal and other'profes- 
sions. David Pollock, who was the son of a Scotsman and built 
up a prosperous business in London as a saddler, had three distin- 
guished sons: Sir David Pollock (1780-1847), chief justice of 
Bombay; Sir Jonathan Frederick Pollock, Bart. (1783-1870), 
chief baron of the exchequer; and Sir George Pollock, Bart. 
(1 786-1872), field-marshal. Of these the more famous were 
the two last. Field Marshal Sir George Pollock, who rendered 
valuable military service in India, and especially in Afghanistan 
in 1 841-1843, ended his days as constable of the Tower of London, 
and was buried in Westminster Abbey; his baronetcy, created in 
1^72, descended to his son Frederick (d. 1874), who assumed 
the name of Montagu-Pollock, and so to his heirs. Chief Baron 
Sir J. Frederick Pollock, who had been senior wrangler at Cam- 
bridge, and became F.R.S. in 1816, was raised to the bench in 
1844, and created a baronet in 1866. He was twice married 



and had eight sons and ten daughters, his numerous descendants 
being prominent in many fields. The chief baron's eldest son, 
Sir William Frederick Pollock, 2nd Bart. (181 5-1888), became a 
master of the Supreme Court (1846) and queen's remembrancer 
(1874); his eldest son, Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Bart. (b. 1845), 
being the well-known jurist and legal historian, fellow of Trinity 
College, Cambridge, and Corpus professor of jurisprudence at 
Oxford ( 1 883-1 903), and the second son, Walter Hemes Pollock 
(b. 1850), being a well-known author and editor of the Saturday 
Review from 1883 to 1894. The chief baron's third son, George 
Frederick Pollock (b. 1821), became a master of the Supreme 
Court in 1851, and succeeded his brother as queen's (king's) 
remembrancer in 1886; among his sons were Dr W. Rivers 
Pollock (1850-1909), Ernest Murry Pollock, K.C. (b. 1861), 
and the Rt. Rev. Bertram Pollock (b. 1863), bishop of Norwich, 
and previously head master of Wellington College from 1893 till 
1910. The chief baron's fourth son, Sir Charles Edward Pollock 
(1823-1897), had a successful career at the bar and in 1873 
became a judge, being the last survivor of the old barons of the 
exchequer; he was thrice married and had issue by each wife. 

POLLOK, ROBERT (1798-1827), Scottish poet, son of a small 
farmer, was born at North Moorhouse, Renfrewshire, on the 19th 
of October 1798. He was trained as a cabinet-maker and after- 
wards worked on his father's farm, but, having prepared himself 
for the university, he took his degree at Glasgow, and studied for 
the ministry of the United Secession Church. He published 
Tales of the Covenanters while he was a divinity student, and 
planned and completed a strongly Calvinistic poem on the spiri- 
tual life and^destiny of man. This was the Course of Time (1827), 
which passed through many editions and became a favourite 
in serious households in Scotland. It was written in blank 
verse, in ten books, in the poetic diction of the 18th century, but 
with abundance of enthusiasm, impassioned elevation of feeling 
and copious force of words and images. The poem at once 
became popular, but within six months of its publication, on the 
1 8th of September 1827, its author died of consumption. 

POLLOKSHAWS, a police burgh and burgh of barony of 
Renfrewshire, Scotland, on the White Cart, now virtually a 
suburb of Glasgow, with which it is connected by electric 
tramway and the Glasgow & South-Western and Caledonian 
railways. Pop. (1901), 11,183. It is named from the shaws 
or woods (and is locally styled " the Shaws ") and the lands of 
Pollok, which have been held by the Maxwells since the 13th 
century. The family is now called Stirling-Maxwell, the estate 
and baronetcy having devolved in 1865 upon Sir William 
Stirling of Keir, who then assumed the surname of Maxwell. 
Pollok House adjoins the town on the west. The staple indus- 
tries are cotton-spinning and weaving, silk-weaving, dyeing, 
bleaching, calico-printing and the manufacture of chenille and 
tapestry, besides paper mills, potteries and large engineering 
works. Pollokshaws was created a burgh of barony in 1813, 
and is governed by a council and provost. About 2 m. south- 
west is the thriving town of Thornliebank (pop. 2452), which 
owes its existence to the cotton-works established towards the 
end of the 18th century. 

POLL-TAX, a tax levied on the individual, and not on 
property or on articles of merchandise, so-called from the old 
English poll, a head. Raised thus per capita, it is sometimes 
called a capitation tax. The most famous poll-tax in English 
history is the one levied in 1380, which led to the revolt of the 
peasants under Wat Tyler in 1381, but the first instance of the 
kind was in 1377, when a tax of a groat a head was voted by both 
clergy and laity. In 1379 the tax was again levied, but on a 
graduated scale. John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, paid ten 
marks, and the scale descended from him to the peasants, who 
paid one groat each, every person over sixteen years of age being 
liable. In 1380 the tax was also graduated, but less steeply. 
For some years after the rising of 1381 money was only raised 
in this way from aliens, but in 15 13 a general poll tax was 
imposed. This, however, only produced about ^S * 000 * instead 
of £160,000 as was expected, but a poll-tax levied in 1641 
resulted in a revenue of about £400,600. During the reign of 



POLLUX, JULIUS— POLO, MARCO 



Charles II. money was obtained in this way on several occasions, 
although in 1676-1677 especially there was a good deal of 
resentment against the tax. For some years after 1688 poll- 
taxes were a favourite means of raising money for the 
prosecution of the war with France. Sometimes a single 
payment was asked for the year; at other times quarterly 
payments were required. The poll-tax of 1697 included a 
weekly tax of one penny from all persons not receiving alms. 
In 1698 a quarterly poll-tax produced £3 2 i>397- Nothing 
was required from the poor, and those who were liable may be 
divided roughly into three classes. Persons worth less than £300 
paid one shilling; those worth £300, including the gentry and 
the professional classes, paid twenty shillings; while tradesmen 
and shopkeepers paid ten shillings. Non-jurors were charged 
double these rates. Like previous poll-taxes, the tax of 1698 
did not produce as much as was anticipated, and it was the last 
of its kind in England. 

Many of the states of the United States of America raise 
money by levying poll-taxes, or, as they are usually called, 
capitation taxes, the payment of this tax being a necessary 
preliminary to the exercise of the suffrage.

POLLUX, JULIUS, of Naucratis in Egypt, Greek grammarian 
and sophist of the 2nd century a.d. He taught at Athens, 
where, according to Philostratus (Vit. Soph.), he was appointed 
to the professorship of rhetoric by the emperor Commodus on 
account of his melodious voice. Suidas gives a list of his 
rhetorical works, none of which has survived. Philostratus 
recognizes his natural abilities, but speaks of his rhetoric in very 
moderate terms. Pollux is probably the person attacked by 
Lucian in the Lexiphanes and Teacher of Rhetoricians. In the 
Teacher of Rhetoricians Lucian satirizes a worthless and ignorant 
person who gains a reputation as an orator by sheer effrontery; the 
Lexiphanes j a satire upon the use of obscure and obsolete words, 
may conceivably have been directed against Pollux as the author 
of the Onomasticon. This work, which we still possess, is a 
Greek dictionary in ten books, each dedicated to Commodus, 
and arranged not alphabetically but according to subject-matter. 
Though mainly a dictionary of synonyms and phrases, chiefly 
intended to furnish the reader with the Attic names for indi- 
vidual things, it supplies much rare and valuable information on 
many points of classical antiquity. It also contains numerous 
fragments of writers now lost. The chief authorities used were 
the lexicological works of Didymus, Tryphon, and Pamphilus; 
in the second book the extant treatise of Rufus of Ephesus 
On the Names of the Parts of the Human Body was specially 
consulted. 

The chief editions of the Onomasticon are those of W. Dindorf 
(1824), with the notes of previous commentators, I. Bekker (1846), 
containing the Greek text only, and Bet he (1900). There are mono- 
graphs on special portions of the vocabulary; by E. Rohde (on 
the theatrical terms, 1870), and F. von Stojentin (on constitutional 
antiquities, 1875). 

POLLUX, or Pollucite, a rare mineral, consisting of hydrous 
caesium and aluminium silicate, HzCs^Al^SiOsV Caesium 
oxide (CsaO) is present to the extent of 30-36 %, the 
amount varying somewhat owing to partial replacement by 
other alkalis, chiefly sodium. The mineral crystallizes in the 
cubic system. It is colourless and transparent, and has a 
vitreous lustre. There is no distinct cleavage and the fracture 
is conchoidal. The hardness is 6£ and the specific gravity 2-90. 
It occurs sparingly, together with the mineral " castor " (see 
Petalite), in cavities in the granite of the island of Elba, and 
with beryl in pegmatite veins at Rumford and Hebron in Maine. 

POLO, GASPAR GIL (?i530-i59i), Spanish novelist and 
poet, was born at Valencia about 1530. He is often confused 
with Gil Polo, professor of Greek at Valencia University between 
1566 and 1573; but this professor was not named Gaspar. He 
is also confused with his own son, Gaspar Gil Polo, the author 
of De origine et progressu juris romani (161 5) and other 
legal treatises, who pleaded before the Cortes as late as 1626. 
A notary by profession, Polo was attached to the treasury 



commission which visited Valencia in 1571, became coadjutor to 
the chief accountant in 1572, went on a special mission to 
Barcelona in 1580, and died there in 1591. Timoneda, in the 
Sarao de amor (1561), alludes to him as a poet of repute; but of 
his miscellaneous verses only two conventional, eulogistic sonnets 
and a song survive. Polo finds a place in the history of the novel 
as the author of La Diana enamorada, a continuation of Monte- 
mayor's Diana, and perhaps the most successful continuation 
ever written by another hand. Cervantes, punning on the 
writer's name, recommended that " the Diana enamorada should 
be guarded as carefully as though it were by Apollo himself "; 
the hyperbole is not wholly, nor even mainly, ironical. 

The book is one of the most agreeable of Spanish pastorals; 
interesting in incident, written in fluent prose, and embellished 
with melodious poems, it was constantly reprinted, was imitated 
by Cervantes in the Canto de Caliope, and was translated into 
English, French, German and Latin. The English version of 
Bartholomew Young, published in 1598 but current in manu- 
script fifteen years earlier, is said to have suggested the Felismena 
episode in the Two Gentlemen of Verona; the Latin version of 
Caspar Barth, entitled Erotodidascalus (Hanover, 1625), is a per- 
formance of uncommon merit as well as a bibliographical curiosity. 

POLO, MARCO (c. 1 254-1324), the Venetian, greatest of 
medieval travellers. Venetian genealogies and traditions of 
uncertain value trace the Polo family to Sebenico in Dalmatia, 
and before the end of the nth century one Domenico Polo is 
found in the great council of the republic (1094). But the 
ascertained line of the traveller begins only with his grandfather. 
Andrea Polo of S. Felice was the father of three sons, Marco, 
Nicolo and Maffeo, of whom the second was the father of the 
subject of this article. They were presumably " noble," i.e. 
belonging to the families who had seats in the great council, 
and were enrolled in the Libro d' Oro; for we know that Marco 
the traveller is officially so styled (nobilis vir). The three 
brothers were engaged in commerce; the eider Marco, resident 
apparently in Constantinople and in the Crimea (especially at 
Sudak), suggests, by his celebrated* will, a long business 
partnership with Nicolo and Maffeo. 

About 1260, and even perhaps as early as 1250, we find Nicolo 
and Maffeo at Constantinople. Nicolo was married and had left 
his wife there. The two brothers went on a speculation to the 
Crimea, whence a succession of chances and openings carried 
them to the court of Barka Khan at Sarai, further north up to 
Bolghar (Kazan), and eventually across the steppes to Bokhara. 
Here they fell in with certain envoys who had been on a mission 
from the great Khan Kublai to his brother Hulagu in Persia, 
and by them were persuaded to make the journey to Cathay in 
their company. Under the heading China the circumstances 
are noticed which in the last half of the 13th century and first 
half of the 14th threw Asia open to Western travellers to a degree 
unknown before and since — until the 19th century. Thus began 
the medieval period of intercourse between China and catholic 
Europe. Kublai, when the Polos reached his court, was either 
at Cambaluc (Khanbaligh, the Khan's city), i.e. Peking, which he 
had just rebuilt, or at his summer seat at Shangtu in the country 
north of the Great Wall. It was the first time that the khan, a 
man full of energy and intelligence, had fallen in with European 
gentlemen. He was delighted with the Venetian brothers, 
listened eagerly to all they had to tell of the Latin world, and 
decided to send them back as his envoys to the pop%-wit1rletters 
requesting the despatch of a large body of educated men to 
instruct his people in Christianity and the liberal arts. With 
Kublai, as with his predecessors, religion was chiefly a political 
engine. Kublai, the first of his house to rise above the essential 
barbarism of the Mongols, had perhaps discerned that the 
Christian Church could afford the aid he desired in taming his 
countrymen. It was only when Rome had failed to meet his 
advance that he fell back upon Buddhism as his chief civilizing 
instrument. 

The brothers arrived at Acre in April 1269. They learned 
that Clement IV. had died the year before, and no new pope had 
yet been chosen. So they took counsel with an eminent church- 
man, Tedaldo, archdeacon of Liege and papal legate for the

POLO, MARCO 



whole realm of Egypt, and, being advised by him to wait 
patiently, went home to Venice, where they found that Nicolo's 
wife was dead, hut had left a son Marco, now fifteen. The papal in- 
terregnum was the longest that had heen known, at least since the 
dark ages. After the Polos had spent two years at home there was 
still no pope, and the brothers resolved on starting again for the 
East, taking young Marco with them. At Acre they again saw 
Tedaldo, and were furnished by him with letters to authenticate 
the causes that had hindered their mission. They had not yet left 
Lajazzo, Layas, or Ayas on the Cilician coast (then one of the 
chief points for the arrival and departure of the land trade of 
Asia), when they heard that Tedaldo had been elected pope. 
They hastened back to Acre, and at last were able to execute 
Kublai's mission, and to obtain a papal reply. But, instead of 
the hundred teachers asked for by the Great Khan, the new pope 
(styled Gregory X.) could supply but two Dominicans; and these 
lost heart and turned hack, when they had barely taken the first 
step of their journey. 

The second start from Acre must have taken place about 
November 1271; and from a consideration of the indications 
and succession of chapters in Polo's book, it would seem that the 
party proceeded from Lajazzo to Sivas and Tabriz, and thence 
by Yezd and Kirman down to Hormuz (Hurmuz) at the mouth 
of the Persian Gulf, with the purpose of going on to China by sea; 
but that, abandoning their naval plans (perhaps from fear of the 
flimsy vessels employed on this navigation fronrthe-Gttlf east- 
wards), they returned northward through Persia. Traversing 
Kirman and Khorasan they went on to Balkh and Badakshan, 
in which last country young Marco recovered from illness. In 
a passage touching on the climate of the Badakshan hills, 
Marco breaks into an enthusiasm which he rarely betrays, but 
which is easily understood by those who have known what 
it is, with fever in the hlood, to escape to the exhilarating 
mountain air and fragrant pine-groves. They then ascended 
the upper Oxus through Wakhan to the plateau of Pamir 
(a name first heard in Marco's book). These regions were 
hardly described again by any European traveller (save Benedict 
Goes) till the expedition in 1838 of Lieut. John Wood of the 
Indian navy, whose narrative abounds in incidental illustratio 
of Marco Polo. Crossing the Pamir the travellers descend* 
upon Kashgar, Yarkand and Khotan (Khutan). These are 
regions which remained almost absolutely closed to our know- 
ledge till after i860, when the temporary overthrow of the 
Chinese power, and the enterprise of British, Russian and other 
explorers, again made them known. 

From Khotan the Polos passed on to the vicinity of Lop-Nor, 
reached for the first time since Polo's journey by Prjevalsky 
in 1 87 1. Thence the great desert of Gobi was crossed to 
Tangut, as the region at the extreme north-west of China, both 
within and without the Wall, was then called. 

In his account of the Gobi, or desert of Lop, as he calls it, 
Polo gives some description of the terrors and superstitions of 
the waste, a description which strikingly reproduces that of 
the Chinese pilgrim Suan T'sang, in passing the same desert in 
the contrary direction six hundred years before. 

The Venetians, in their further journey, were met and 
welcomed by the Great Khan's people, and at last reached his 
presence at Shangtu, in the spring of 1275. Kublai received 
them with great cordiality, and took kindly to young Marco, by 
this time about twenty-one years old. The " young bachelor," 
as the book calls him, applied himself diligently to the acquisi- 
tion of the divers languages and written characters chiefly in use 
among the multifarious nationalities subject to the Khan; and 
Kublai, seeing that he was both clever and discreet, soon 
began to employ him in the public service. G. Pauthier found 
in the Chinese annals a record that in the year 1277 a certain Polo 
was nominated as a second-class commissioner or agent attached 
to the imperial council, a passage which we may apply to the 
young Venetian. Among his public missions was one which 
carried him through the provinces of Shansi, Shensi, and 
Szechuen, and the wild country on the borders of Tibet, to the 
remote province of Yunnan, called by the Mongols Karajang, 



and into northern Burma (Mien). Marco, during his stay at 
court, had observed the Khan's delight in hearing of strange 
countries, of their manners, marvels, and oddities, and had 
heard his frank expressions of disgust at the stupidity of envoys 
and commissioners who could tell of nothing but their official 
business. He took care to store his memory or his note-hook 
with curious facts likely to interest Kublai, which, on his return 
to court, he related. This south-western journey led him 
through a country which till about i860 was almost a terra 
incognita — though since the middle of the 19th century we have 
learned much regarding it through the journeys of Cooper, 
Gamier, Richthofen, Gill, Baber and others. In this region 
there existed and still exists in the deep valleys of the great 
rivers, and in the alpine regions which border them, a vast 
ethnological garden, as it were, of tribes of various origin, and 
in every stage of semi-civilization or barbarism; these afforded 
many strange products and eccentric traits to entertain Kublai. 

Marco rose rapidly in favour and was often employed on 
distant missions as well as in domestic administration; but we 
gather few details of his employment. He held for three years 
the government of the great city of Yangchow; on another 
occasion he seems to have visited Kangchow, the capital of 
Tangut, just within the Great Wall, and perhaps Karakorum on 
the north of the Gobi, the former residence of the Great Khans: 
again we find him in Ciampa, or southern Cochin-China; and 
perhaps, once more, on a separate mission to the southern states 
of India. We are not informed whether his father and uncle 
shared in such employments, though they are mentioned as 
having rendered material service to the Khan, in forwarding 
the capture of Siang-yang (on the Han river) during the war 
against southern China, by the construction of powerful 
artillery engines — a story, however, perplexed by chronological 
difficulties. 

All the Polos were gathering wealth which they longed to carry 
back to their home, and after their exile they began to dread 
what might follow Kublai's death. The Khan, however, was 
deaf to suggestions of departure and the opportunity only 
ca me by chance. " ^ 7 
£ .^-^TTrgnun, khan of Persia, the grandson of Kublai's brother 

ulagu, lost in 1286 his favourite wife, called by Polo Balgana 
(i.e. Bulughan or " Sable "). Her dying injunction was that her 
place should be filled only by a lady of her own Mongol tribe. 
Ambassadors were despatched to the court of Peking to obtain 
such a bride. The message was courteously received, and 
the choice fell on the lady Cocacin (Kukachin), a maiden of 
seventeen. The overland road from Peking to Tabriz was then 
imperilled by war, so Arghun's envoys proposed to return by 
sea. Having made acquaintance with the Venetians, and eager 
to profit by their experience, especially by that of Marco, who 
had just returned from a mission to the Indies, they begged the 
Khan to send the Franks in their company. He consented with 
reluctance, but fitted out the party nobly for the voyage, charging 
them with friendly messages to the potentates of Christendom, 
including the pope, and the kings of France, Spain and England. 
They sailed from Zaiton or Amoy Harhour in Fukien (a town 
corresponding either to the modern Changchow or less probably 
toTswanchoworChinchew),thenoneof the chief Chinese havens 
for foreign trade, in the beginning of 1292. The voyage in- 
volved long detention on the coast of Sumatra, and in south 
India, and two years or more passed before they arrived in 
Persia. Two of the three envoys and a vast proportion of their 
suite perished by the way; but the three Venetians survived all 
perils, and so did the young lady, who had come to look on them 
with filial regard. Arghun Khan had died even before they 
quitted China; his brother reigned in his stead; and his son 
Ghazan succeeded to the lady's hand. The Polos went on 
(apparently by Tabriz, Trebizond, Constantinople and Negro- 
pont) to Venice, which they seem to have reached about the end 
of 1295. 

The first biographer of Marco Polo was the famous geo- 
graphical collector John Baptist Ramusio, who wrote more than 
two centuries after the traveller's death. Facts and dates

sometimes contradict his statements, but he often adds detail, 
evidently authentic, of great interest and value, and we need not 
hesitate to accept as a genuine tradition the substance of his 
story of the Polos' arrival at their family mansion in St John 
Chrysostom parish in worn and outlandish garb, of the scornful 
denial of their identity, and the stratagem by which they secured 
acknowledgment from Venetian society. 

We next hear of Marco Polo in a militant capacity. Jealousies 
had been growing in bitterness between Venice and Genoa 
thioughout the 13th century. In 1298 the Genoese prepared 
to strike at their rivals on their own ground, and a powerful fleet 
under Lamba Doria made for the Adriatic. Venice, on hearing 
of the Genoese armament, equipped a fleet still more numerous, 
and placed it under Andrea Dandolo. The crew of a Venetian 
galley at this time amounted, all told, to 250 men, under a 
comito or master, but besides this officer each galley carried a 
sopracomito or gentleman-commander, usually a noble. On one 
of the galleys of Dandolo's fleet Marco Polo seems to have gone 
in this last capacity. The hostile fleets met before Curzola 
Island on the 6th of September, and engaged next morning. 
The battle ended in a complete victory for Genoa, the details 
of which may still be read on the facade of St Matthew's church 
in that city. Sixty-six Venetian galleys were burnt in 
Curzola Bay, and eighteen were carried to Genoa, with 7000 
prisoners, one of whom was Marco Polo. The captivity was of 
less than a year's duration; by the mediation of Milan peace 
was made, on honourable terms for both republics, by July 
1299; and Marco was probably restored to his family during 
that or the following month. 

But his captivity was memorable as the immediate cause of 
his Book. Up to this time he had doubtless often related his 
experiences among his friends; and from these stories, and the 
'frequent employment in them (as it would seem) of grand 
numerical expressions, he had acquired the nickname of Marco 
Millioni. Yet it would seem that he had committed nothing 
to writing. The narratives not only of Marco Polo but of 
several other famous medieval travellers {e.g. Ibn Batuta, 
Friar Odoric, Nicolo Conti) seem to have been extorted from 
them by a kind of pressure, and committed to paper by other 
hands. Examples, perhaps, of that intense dislike to the use of 
pen and ink which still prevails among ordinary respectable 
folk on the shores of the Mediterranean. 

In the prison of Genoa Marco Polo fell in with a certain person 
of writing propensities, Rusticiano or Rustichello of Pisa, also a 
captive of the Genoese. His name is otherwise known as that 
of a respectable literary hack, who abridged and recast several 
of the French romances of the Arthurian cycle, then in fashion. 
He wrote down Marco's experiences at his dictation. 

We learn little of Marco Polo's personal or family history 
after this captivity; but we know that at his death he 
left a wife, Donata (perhaps of the Loredano family, but 
this is uncertain), and three daughters, Fantina and Bellela 
(married, the former to Marco Bragadino), and Moreta 
(then a spinster, but married at a later date to Ranuzzo 
Dolfino). One last glimpse of the traveller is gathered from 
his will, now in St Mark's library. On the 9th of January 
1324 the traveller, in his seventieth year, sent for a neighbouring 
priest and notary to make his testament. We do not know the 
exact time of his death, but it fell almost certainly within the 
year 1324, for we know from a scanty series of documents, 
beginning in June 1325, that he had at the latter date been 
some time dead. He was buried, nTaccordance with his will, 
in the Church of St Lorenzo, where the family burying-place 
was marked by a sarcophagus, erected by his filial care for his 
father Nicolo, which existed till near the end of the 16th century. 
On the renewal of the church* in 1592 this seems to have 
disappeared. 

The archives of Venice have yielded a few traces of our tra- 
veller. Besides his own will just alluded to, there arc the wills of 
his uncle Marco and of his younger brother Mafleo; a few legal 
documents connected with the house property in St John 
Chrysostom, and other papers of similar character; and I 



two or three entries in the record of the Maggior Con- 
siglio. We have mentioned the sobriquet of Marco Millioni. 
Ramusio tells us that he had himself noted the use of this name 
in the public books of the commonwealth, and this statement 
has been verified in an entry in the books of the Great Council 
(dated April 10, 1305), which records as one of the securities 
in a certain case the " Nobilis vir Marchus Paulo Miuon." 
It is alleged that long after the traveller's death there was 
always in the Venetian masques one individual who assumed 
the character of Marco Millioni, and told Munchauscn-like 
stories to divert the vulgar. There is also a record (March 9, 
13 n) of the judgment of the court of requests (Curia Peti- 
tionum) upon a suit brought by the " Nobilis vir Marcus Polo " 
against Paulo Girardo, who had been an agent of his, to recover 
the value of a certain quantity of musk for which Girardo had 
not accounted. Another document is a catalogue of certain 
curiosities and valuables which were collected in the house of 
Marino Faliero, and this catalogue comprises several objects 
that Marco Polo had given to one of the Faliero family. 

The most tangible record of Polo's memory in Venice is a 
portion of the Ca' Polo — the mansion (there is reason to believe) 
where the three travellers, after their long absence, were denied 
entrance. The court in which it stands was known in Ramusio's 
time as the Corte del millioni, and now is called Corte Sabbionera. 
That which remains of the ancient edifice is a passage with a 
decorated archway of Italo-Byzantine character pertaining to 
the 13th century. 

No genuine portrait of Marco Polo exists. There is a medallion 
portrait on the wall of the Sala dello Scudo in the ducal palace, 
which has become a kind of type; but it is a work of imagination 
no older than 1761. The oldest professed portrait is one in the 
gallery of Monsignor Badia at Rome, which is inscribed Marcus 
Polus venetus lotius orbis et Indie peregrator primus. It is 
a good picture, but evidently of the 16th century at earliest. 
The Europeans at Canton have absurdly attached the name of 
Marco Polo to a figure in a Buddhist temple there containing a 
gallery of " Arhans " or Buddhist saints, and popularly known 
as the " temple of the five hundred gods." The Venetian 
municipality obtained a copy of this on the occasion of the 
geographical congress at Venice in 18S1. 

The book indited by Rusticiano is in two parts. The first, or 
prologue, as it is termed, is unfortunately the only part which con- 
sists of actual personal narrative. It relates in an interesting 
though extremely brief fashion the circumstances which led the 
two elder Polos to the Khan's court, together with those of their 
second journey (when accompanied by Marco), and of the return 
to the west by the Indian seas and Persia. The second and staple 
part consists of a series of chapters of unequal length and unsystem- 
atic structure, descriptive of the different states and provinces of 
Asia (certain African islands and regions included), with occasional 
notices of their sights and products, of curious manners and re- 
markable events, and especially regarding the Emperor Kublai, 
his court, wars and administration. A series of chapters near ^ 
the close treats of sundry wars that took place between various'* 
branches of the house ofjenghiz in the latter half of the 13th 
century. This last series is either omitted or greatly curtailed in 
all the MS. copies and versions except one (Paris, National Library, 
Fonds Fr. n 16). 

It was long doubtful in what language the work was originally 
written. That this had been some dialect of Italian was a natural 
presumption, and a contemporary statement could be alleged in 
its favour. But there is now no doubt that the original was French. 
This was first indicated by Count Baldelli-Boni, who published an 
elaborate edition of two of the Italian texts at Florence in 1827, 
and who found in the oldest of these indisputable signs that it was 
a translation from the French. The argument has since been 
followed up by others; and a manuscript in rude and peculiar 
French, belonging to the National Library of Paris (Fonds Fr. 
1 116), which was printed by the Soc\6t6 de gtograpkit in 1824, is 
evidently either the original or a close transcript of the original 
dictation. A variety of its characteristics are strikingly indicative 
of the unrevised product of dictation, and are such as would 
necessarily have disappeared either in a translation or in a revised 
copy. Many illustrations could be adduced of the fact that the use 
of French was not a circumstance of surprising or unusual nature; 
for the language had at that time, in some points of view, even a 
wider diffusion than at present, and examples of its literary em- 
ployment by writers who were not Frenchmen (like Rusticiano 
himself, a compiler of French romances) are very numerous. 



IO 



POLO, MARCO 



Eighty-five MSS. of the book are known, and their texts exhibit 
considerable differences. These fall under four principal types. 
Of these, type i. is found completely only in that old French codex 
which has been mentioned (Paris, National Library, Fr. 1116). 
Type ii. is shown by several valuable MSS. in purer French (Paris, 
Nat. Libr., Fr. 2810; Fr. 5631; Fr. 5649; Bern, Canton Library, 
125), which formed the basis of the edition prepared by the late 
M. Pauthier in 1865. It exhibits a text condensed and revised 
from the rude original, but without any exactness, though perhaps 
under some general direction by Marco Polo himself, for an inscrip- 
tion prefixed to certain MSS. (Bern, Canton Libr. 125; Pans, 
Nat. Libr., Fr. 5649) records the presentation of a copy by the tra- 
veller himself to the Seigneur Thi6bault de Cepoy, a distinguished 
Frenchman known to history, at Venice in the year 1306. Type 
Hi. is that of a Latin version prepared in Marco Polo's lifetime, 
though without any sign of his cognisance, by Francesco Pipino, 
a Dominican of Bologna, and translated from an Italian copy. 
In this, condensation and curtailment are carried a good deal further 
than in type ii. Some of the forms under which this type appears 
curiously illustrate the effects of absence of effective publication, 
not only before the invention of the press, but in its early days. 
Thus the Latin version published by Grynaeus at Basel in the 
Novus Orbis (1532) is different in its language from Pipino's, and 
yet is clearly traceable to that as its foundation. In fact it is a 
retranslation into Latin from some version of Pipino (Marsdcn 
thinks the Portuguese printed one of 1502). It introduces changes 
of its own, and is worthless as a text; yet Andreas Miiller, who in 
the 17th century took so much trouble with Polo, unfortunately 
chose as his text this fifth-hand version. The French editions 
published in the middle of the 16th century were translations 
from Grynaeus's Latin. Hence they complete this curious and vicious 
circle of transmission — French, Italian, Pipino's Latin, Portuguese, 
Grynaeus's Latin, French. 

Type iv. deviates largely from those # already mentioned; its 
history and true character are involved in obscurity. It is only 
represented by the Italian version prepared for the press by John 
Baptist Ramusio, with interesting preliminary dissertations, and 
published at Venice two years after his death, in the second volume 
of the Navigalioni e viaggi. Its peculiarities are great. Ramusio 
seems to imply that he made some use of Pipino's Latin, and various 
passages confirm this. But many new circumstances, and anec- 
dotes occurring in no other copy, are introduced; many names 
assume a new shape; the whole style is more copious and literary 
than that of any other version. While a few ot the changes and 
interpolations seem to carry us farther from the truth, others 
contain facts of Asiatic nature or history, as well as of Polo's 
alleged experiences, which it is difficult to ascribe to any hand 
but the traveller's own. 

We recognize to a certain extent tampering with the text, as in 
cases where Polo's proper names have been identified, and^ more 
modern forms substituted. In some other cases the editorial 
spirit has gone astray. Thus the age of young Marco has been 
altered to correspond with a date which is itself erroneous. Ormuz 
is described as an island, contrary to the old texts, and to the fact 
in Polo's time. In speaking of the oil-springs of Caucasus the 
phrase " camel-loads ' has been substituted for " ship-loads," 
in ignorance that the site was Baku on the Caspian. 

But, on the other hand, there are a number of new circumstances 
certainly genuine, which can hardly be ascribed^ to any one but 
Polo himself. Such is the account which Ramusio's version ^ives 
of the oppressions exercised by Kublai's Mahommedan minister 
Ahmad, telling how the Cathayans rose against him and murdered 
him, with the addition that Messer Marco was on the spot when 
all this happened. Not only is the whole story in substantial 
accordance with the Chinese annals, even to the name of the chief 
conspirator (Vanchu in Ramusio, Wangcheu in the Chinese records), 
but the annals also tell of the frankness of " Polo, assessor of the 
privy council," in opening Kublai's eyes to the iniquities of his 
agent. 

Polo was the first traveller to trace a route across the whole 
longitude of Asia, naming and describing kingdom after kingdom 
which he had seen; the first to speak of the new and brilliant court 
which had been established at Peking; the first to reveal China in 
all its wealth and vastness, and to tell of the nations on its borders; 
the first to tell more of Tibet than its name, to speak of Burma, 
of Laos, of Siam, of Cochin-China, of Japan, of Java, of Sumatra 
and of other islands of the archipelago, of the Nicobar and Andaman 
Islands, of Ceylon and its sacred peak, of India but as a country 
seen and partially explored; the first in medieval times to give 
any distinct account of the secluded Christian Empire of Abyssinia, 
and of the semi-Christian island of Sokotra, and to speak, however 
dimly, of Zanzibar, and of the vast and distant Madagascar; whilst 
he carries us also to the remotely opposite region of Siberia and the 
Arctic shores, to speak of dog-sledges, white bears and reindeer- 
riding Tunguses. 

The diffusion of the book was hardly so rapid as has been some- 
times alleged. We know from Gilles Mallet's catalogue of the books 
collected in the Louvre by Charles V., dating c. 1 370-1375, that 
five copies of Marco Polo's work were then in the collection ; but on 
the other hand, the 202 known MSS. and the numerous early printed 



editions of " Mandevillc," with his lying wonders, indicates a much 
greater popularity. Dante, who lived twenty-three years after 
the book was dictated, and who touches so many things in the seen 
and unseen worlds, never alludes to Polo, nor, we believe, to any- 
thing that can be connected with him ; nor can any trace of Polo 
be discovered in the book of his contemporary, Marino Sanudo 
the Elder, though this worthy is well acquainted with the work, 
later by some years, of Hayton the Armenian, and though many 
of the subjects on which he writes in his own book (Secreta Fidelium 
Cruets 1 ) challenge a reference to Polo's experiences. " Mande- 
ville " himself, who plundered right and left, hardly ever plunders 
Polo (see one example in Dawn of Modern Geography, iii. 323, note). 
The only literary works we know of the 14th century which show 
acquaintance with Polo's book or achievements are Pipino's 
Chronicle, Villani's Florentine History, Pietro d'Abano's Conciliator, 
the Chronicle of John of Ypres, and the poetical romance of Baudouin 
de Sebourc, which last borrows themes largely from Polo. 

Within the traveller's own lifetime we find the earliest examples 
of the practical and truly scientific coast-charts {Portolani), based 
upon the experience of pilots, mariners, merchants, &c. In two of 
the most famous of the 14th century Portolani, we trace Marco 
Polo's influence — first, very slightly in the Laurentian or Medicean 
Portolano of 1351 (at Florence), but afterwards with clearness 
and in remarkable detail in the Catalan Atlas of 1375 (now at 
Paris). Both of these represent a very advanced stage of medieval 
knowledge, a careful attempt to represent the known world on the 
basis of collected fact, and a disregard for theological or pseudo- 
scientific theory; in the Catalan Atlas, as regards Central and 
Further Asia, and partially as regards India, Marco Polo's Book is 
the basis of the map. His names are often much perverted, and it 
is not always easy to understand the view that the compiler took 
of his itineraries. Still we have Cathay placed in the true position 
of China, as a great empire filling the south-east of Asia. The 
trans-Gangetic peninsula is absent, but that of India proper is, 
for the first time in the history of geography, represented with a 
fair approximation to correct form and position. 

It is curious that, in the following age, owing partly to his un- 
happy reversion to the fancy of a circular disk, the map of Fra 
Mauro (1459), one of the greatest map-making enterprises in history, 
and the result of immense labour in the collection of facts and the 
endeavour to combine them, gives a much less accurate idea of 
Asia than the Carta catalana. Columbus possessed a printed 
copy of the Latin version of Polo's book made by Pipino, and on 
more than seventy pages of this there are manuscript notes in the 
admiral's handwnting, testifying, what is sufficiently evident from 
the whole history of the Columbian voyages, to the immense in- 
fluence of the work of the Venetian merchant upon the discoverer 
of the new world. 

When, in the 16th century, attempts were made to combine 
new and old knowledge, the results were unhappy. The earliest 
of such combinations tried to realize Columbus's ideas regarding 
the identity of his discoveries with the Great Khan's dominions; 
but even after America had vindicated its independent existence, 
and the new knowledge of the Portuguese had named China where 
the Catalan map had spoken of Cathay, the latter country, with 
the whole of Polo's nomenclature, was shunted to the north, forming 
a separate system. Henceforward the influence of Polo's work 
on maps was simply injurious; and when to his names was added 
a sprinkling of Ptolemy's, as was usual throughout the 16th century, 
the result was a hotchpotch conveying no approximation to facts 
(see further Map). 

As to the alleged introduction of important inventions into 
Europe by Polo — although the striking resemblance of early Euro- 
pean block-books to those of China seems clearly to indicate the 
derivation of the art from that country, there is no reason for 
connecting this introduction (any more than that of gunpowder 
or the mariner's compass) with the name of Marco. In the 14th 
century not only were missions of the Roman Church established in 
some of the chief cities of eastern China, but a regular overland 
trade was carried on between Italy and China, by way of Tana 
(Azov), Astrakhan, Otrar, Kamul (Hami) and Kanchow. Many 
a traveller other than Marco Polo might have brought home the 
block-books, and some might have witnessed the process of making 
them. This is the less to be ascribed to Polo, because he so curiously 
omits to speak of the process of printing, when, in describing the 
block-printed paper-money of China, his subject seems absolutely 
to challenge a description of the art.

POLO (Tibetan pulu, ball), the most ancient of games with 
stick and ball. Hockey, the Irish national game of hurling 
(and possibly golf and cricket) are derived from polo. 
History. Thc latter was called hockey or hurling on horse- 
back in England and Ireland respectively, but historically 
hockey and hurling are polo on foot. 

The earliest records of polo are Persian. From Persia the 
game spread westward to Constantinople, eastwards through 
Turkestan to Tibet, China and Japan. From Tibet polo travelled 
to Gilgit and Chitral, possibly also to Manipur. Polo also flourished 
in India in the 16th century. Then for 200 years its records in 
India cease, till in 1854 polo came into Bengal from Manipur by 
way of Cachar and in 1862 the game was played in the Punjab. 

There have been twelve varieties of the game during its 
existence of at least 2000 years. (1) A primitive form 
consisting of feats of horsemanship and of skill with stick and 
ball. (2) Early Persian, described in Shahnama, a highly 
organized game with rules, played four aside. (3) Later 
Persian, 1 6th century, the grounds 300 by 1 70 yds. Sir Anthony 
Shirley says the game resembled the rough football of the same 
period in England. (4) The game in the 17th century in Persia. 
A more highly organized game than No. 3, as described by 
Chardin. (5) The Byzantine form played at Constantinople 
in the 12th century. A leathern ball the size of an apple and 
a racquet were used. (6) The Chinese game, about a.d. 600 
played with a light wooden ball. The goal was formed by 
two posts with a boarding between, in the latter a hole being 
cut and a net attached to it in the form of a bag. The side 
which hit the ball into the bag were the winners. Another 
Chinese form was two teams ranged on opposite sides of 
the ground, each defending its own goal. The object of the 
game was to drive the ball through the enemy's goal. (7) The 
Japanese game, popular in feudal times, still survives under 
the name of Dakiu, or ball match. The Japanese game 
has a boarded goal; 5 ft. from the ground is a circular hole 
1 ft. 2 in. in diameter with a bag behind. The balls are of 
paper with a cover of pebbles or bamboo fibre, diameter 
i«7 in., weight ij oz. The sticks are racket shaped. The 
object is to lift over or carry the ball with the racket and 
place it in the bag. (8) Called rol, played with a long stick 
with which the ball was dribbled along the ground. (9) Another 
ancient Indian form in which the sides ranged up on opposite 
sides of the ground and the ball was thrown in. This is 
probably the form of the game which reached India from 
Persia and is represented at the present day by Manipur and 
Gilgit polo, though these forms are probably rougher than the 
old Indian game. (10) Modern English with heavy ball and 
sticks, played in England and the colonies and wherever polo 
is played in Europe. Its characteristics are: offside; severe 
penalties for breach of the rules; close combination; rather 
short passing; low scoring, and a strong defence, (n) Indian 
polo has a lighter ball, no boards to the grounds, which are 
usually full-sized; a modified offside-rule, but the same system of 
penalties. It is a quicker game than the English. (12) The 
American game has no offside and no penalties, in the English 
sense. The attack is stronger, the passing longer, the pace 
greater and more sustained. American players are more certain 



goal-hitters and their scoring is higher. They defeated the 
English players in 1909 with ease. 

Polo was first played in England by the 10th Hussars in 1869. 
The game spread rapidly and some good play was seen at Lillie 
Bridge. But the organization of polo in England dates from 
its adoption by the Hurlingham Club in 1873. The ground 
was boarded along the sides, and this device, which was employed 
as a remedy for the irregular shape of the Hurlingham ground, 
has become almost universal and has greatly affected the develop- 
ment of the game. The club committee, in 1874, drew up the first 
code of rules, which reduced the number of players to five a side 
and included offside. The next step was the foundation of the 
Champion Cup, in 1877. Then came the rule dividing the game 
into periods of ten minutes, with intervals of two minutes for 
changing ponies after each period, and five minutes at half- 
time. The height of ponies was fixed at 14*2, and a little later 
an official measurer was appointed, no pony being allowed to 
play unless registered at Hurlingham. The next change was 
the present scale of penalties for offside, foul riding or dangerous 
play. A short time after, the crooking of the adversary's stick, 
unless in the act of hitting the ball, was forbidden. The game 
grew faster, partly as the result of these rules. Then the ten 
minutes' rule was revised. The period did not close until the 
ball went over the boundary. Thus the period might be ex- 
tended to twelve or thirteen minutes, and although this time 
was deducted from the next period the strain of the extra 
minutes was too great on men and ponies. It was therefore 
laid down that the ball should go out of play on going out of 
bounds or striking the board, whichever happened first. In 1910 
a polo handicap was established, based on the American system 
of estimating the number of goals a player was worth to his 
side. This was modified in the English handicap by assigning 
to each player a handicap number as at golf. The highest 
number is ten, the lowest one. The Hurlingham handicap is 
revised during the winter, again in May, June and July, each 
handicap coming into force one month after the date of issue. 
In tournaments under handicap the individual handicap numbers 
are added together, and the team with the higher aggregate 
concedes goals to that with the lower, according to the con- 
ditions of the tournament. The handicap serves to divide 
second from first class tournaments, for the former teams must 
not have an aggregate over 25. 

The size of the polo ground is 300 yds. in length and from 
160 to 200 yds. in width. The larger size is only found now 
where boards are not used. The ball is made of willow root, is 
3 J in. in diameter, weight not over 5 J oz. The polo stick has 
no standard size or weight, and square or cigar-shaped heads 
are used at the discretion of the player. On soft grounds, the 
former, on hard grounds the latter are the better, but Indian 
and American players nearly always prefer the cigar shape. 

The goal posts, now generally made of papier mach6, are 
8 yds. apart. This is the goal line. Thirty yards from the goal 
hne a line is marked out, nearer than which to the goal no one 
of a fouled side may be when the side fouling has to hit out, 
as a penalty from behind the back line, which is the goal line 
produced. At 50 yds. from each goal there is generally a mark 
to guide the man who takes a free hit as a penalty. 

Penalties are awarded by the umpires, who should be two in 
number, well mounted, and with a good knowledge of the rules 
of the game. The Hurlingham and Ranelagh clubs appoint 
official umpires. There should also be a referee in case of 
disagreement between the umpires, and it is usual to have a 
man with a flag behind each goal to signal when a goal is 
scored. The Hurlingham club makes and revises the rules of 
the game, and its code is, with some local modifications , in force 
in the United Kingdom, English-speaking colonies, the Argentine 
Republic, California, and throughout Europe. America and 
India are governed by their own polo associations. « 

The American rules have no offside, and their penalties consist 
of subtracting a goal or the fraction of a goal, according to the 
offence, from the side which has incurred a penalty for fouling. 
The differences between the Hurlingham and Indian rules 



12 



POLONAISE— POLONNARUWA 



are very slight, and they tend to assimilate more as time 
goes on. 

Polo in the army is governed by an army polo committee, 
which fixes the date of the inter-regimental tournament. The 
semi-finals and finals are played at Hurlingham. The earlier 
ties take place at centres arranged by the army polo committee, 
who are charged by the military authorities with the duty of 
cheeking the expenditure of officers on the game. The value of 
polo as a military exercise is now fully recognized, and with the 
co-operation of Hurlingham, Ranelagh and Roehampton the 
expenses of inter-regimental tournaments have been regulated 
and restrained. 

The County Polo Association has affiliated to it all the county 
clubs. It is a powerful body, arranging the conditions of county 
tournaments, constructing the handicaps for county players, and 
in conjunction with the Ranelagh club holding a polo week for 
county players in London. The London clubs are three — 
Hurlingham^ Ranelagh and Roehampton. Except that they use 
Hurlingham rules the clubs are independent, and arrange the con- 
ditions and fix the dates of their own tournaments. Ranelagh 
has four, Roehampton three and Hurlingham two polo grounds. 
There are about 400 matches played at these clubs, besides 
members' games from May to July during the London season. 
At present the Meadowbrook still hold the cup which was won 
inter- by an English team in 1886. In 1902 an American 
national team made an attempt to recover it and failed. 
Polo. They lacked ponies and combination; but they bought 

the first and learned the second, and tried again successfully 
in 1909, thus depriving English polo of the championship of 
the world. 

m Polo in England has passed through several stages. It was 
always a game of skill. The cavalry regiments in India in early 
The Game, P°^° days, the 5th, 9th, 12th and 17th Lancers, the 
10th Hussars and the 13th Hussars, had all learned the 
value of combination. In very early days regimental players had 
learned the value of the backhanded stroke, placing the ball so as 
to give opportunities to their own side. The duty of support- 
ing the other members of the team and riding off opponents 
so as to clear the way for players on the same side was 
understood. This combination was made easier when the 
teams were reduced from five a side to four. Great stress 
was laid on each man keeping his place, but a more 
flexible style of play existed from early days in the 17 th Lancers 
and was improved and perfected at the Rugby Club by the late 
Colonel Gordon Renton and Captain E. D. Miller, who had 
belonged to that regiment*. For a long time the Rugby style 
of play, with its close combination, short passes and steady 
defence, was the model on which other teams formed themselves. 
The secret of the success of Rugby was the close and unselfish 
combination and the hard work done by every member of the 
team. After the American victories of 1909 a bolder, harder 
hitting style was adopted, and the work of the forwards became 
more important, and longer passes are now the rule. But the 
main principles are the same. The forwards lead the attack and 
are supported by the half-back and back when playing towards 
the adversaries' goal. In defence the forwards hamper the 
opposing No. 3 and No. 4 and endeavour to clear the way for 
their own No. 3 and No. 4, who are trying not merely to keep the 
ball out of their own goal but to turn defence into attack. Each 
individual player must be a good horseman, able to make a pony 
gallop, must have a control of the ball, hitting hard and clean 
and in the direction he wishes it to go. He must keep his eye 
on the ball and yet know where the goal-posts are, must be 
careful not to incur penalties and quick to take advantage of an 
opportunity. Polo gives no time for second thoughts. A polo 
player must not be in a hurry, but he must never be slow nor 
dwell on his stroke. He must be able to hit when galloping his 
best pace on to the ball and able to use the speed of his pony 
in order to get pace. He must be able to hit a backhander or 
to meet a ball coming to him, as the tactics of the game require. 
Polo has given rise to a new type of horse, an animal of 
14 hands 2 in. with the power of a hunter, the courage of a 



racehorse and the docility of a pony. At first the ponies were 
small, but now each pony must pass the Hurlingham official 
measurer and be entered on the register. The English The Polo 
system of measurement is the fairest and most Pony, 
humane possible. The pony stripped of his clothing is led by 
an attendant, not his own groom, into a box with a perfectly 
level floor and shut off from every distraction. A veterinary 
surgeon examines to see that the pony is neither drugged nor 
in any way improperly prepared. The pony is allowed to 
stand easily, and a measuring standard with a spirit-level is 
then placed on the highest point of the wither, and if the pony 
measures 14-2 and is five years old it is registered for life. Ponies 
are of many breeds. There are Arabs, Argentines, Americans, 
Irish and English ponies, the last two being the best. The Polo 
and Riding Pony Society, with headquarters at 12 Hanover 
Square, looks after the interests of the English and Irish pony 
and encourages their breeders. The English ponies are now 
bred largely for the game and are a blend of thoroughbred 
blood (the best are always the race- winning strains) or Arab and 
of the English native pony.

POLONAISE {i.e. Polish, in French), a stately ceremonious 
dance, usually written in £ time. As a form of musical com- 
position it has been employed by such composers as Bach, 
Handel, Beethoven, and above all by Chopin. It is usual to 
date the origin of the dance from the election (1573) of Henry 
duke of Anjou, afterwards Henry III. of France, to the throne 
of Poland. The ladies of the Polish nobility passed in cere- 
monial procession before him at Cracow to the sound of stately 
music. This procession of music became the regular opening 
ceremony at royal functions, and developed into the dance. 

The term is also given to a form of skirted bodice, which has

ruins date chiefly from the time of Prakrama Bahu (a.d. 1153- 
1186). The most imposing pile remaining is the Jetawa- 
narama temple, a building 170 ft. in length, with walls about 
80 ft. high and 12 ft. thick. The city is now entirely deserted,

been rescued from the jungle. 



POLOTSK— POLTAVA

POLOTSK, a town of Russia, in the government of Vitebsk, 
at the confluence of the Polota with the Dvina, 62 m. by rail 
N.W. of the town of Vitebsk. Pop. 20,751. Owing to the 
continuous wars, of which, from its position on the line of 
communication between central Russia and the west it was for 
many centuries the scene, scarcely any of its remarkable anti- 
quities remain. The upper castle, which stood at the confluence 
of the rivers and had a stone wall with seven towers, is in ruins, 
as is the lower castle formerly enclosed with strong walls and 
connected with the upper castle by a bridge. The cathedral 
of St Sophia in the uppef castle, built in the 12th century, 
fell to ruins in the 18th century, whereupon the United Greek 
bishop substituted a modern structure. Upwards of two-thirds 
of the inhabitants are Jews; the remainder have belonged mostly 
to the Orthodox Greek Church since 1839, when they were 
compelled to abandon the United Greek Church. Flax, linseed, 
corn and timber are the leading articles of commerce. 

Polotesk or Poltesk is mentioned in 862 as one of the towns 
given by the Scandinavian Rurik to his men. In 980 it had 
a prince of its own, Ragvald (Rogvolod or Rognvald), whose 
daughter is the subject of many legends. It remained an 
independent principality "until the 12th century, resisting the 
repeated attacks of the princes of Kiev; those of Pskov, Lithu- 
ania, and the Livonian fcnights, however, proved more effective, 
and Polotsk fell under Lithuanian rule in 1320. About 1385 its 
independence was destroyed by the Lithuanian prince Vitovt. 
It was five times besieged by Moscow in 1500-18, and was 
taken by Ivan the Terrible in 1563. Recaptured by Stephen 
Bathory, king of Poland, sixteen years later, it became Polish 
by the treaty of 1582. It was then a large and populous 
city, and carried on an active commerce. Pestilences and 
conflagrations were its ruin; the plague of 1566 wrought 
great havoc among its inhabitants, and that of 1600 destroyed 
15,000. The castles, the town and its walls were burned in 
1607 and 1642. The Russians continued their attacks, burning 
and plundering the town, and twice, in 1633 and 1705, taking 
possession of it for a few years. It was not definitely annexed, 
however, to Russia until 1772, after the first dismemberment 
of Poland. In" 1812 its inhabitants resisted the French invasion, 
and the town was partially destroyed. 

POLTAVA, a government of south-western Russia, bounded 
by the government of Chernigov on the N., Kharkov on the E.> 
Ekaterinoslav and Kherson on the S., and Kiev on the W., and 
having an area of 19,260 sq. m. Its surface is an undulating 
plain 500 to 600 ft. above sea-level, with a few elevations reach- 
ing 670 ft. in the north, and gently sloping to 300 and 400 ft. in 
the south-west. Owing to the deep excavations of the rivers, 
their banks, especially those on the right, have the aspect of 
hilly tracts, while low plains stretch to the left. Almost the 
whole of the surface consists of Tertiary deposits; Cretaceous 
rocks appear in the north-east, at the bottom of the deeper 
ravines. The government touches the granitic region of the 
Dnieper only in the south, below Kremenchug. Limestone 
with dolerite veins occurs in the isolated hill of Isachek, which 
rises above the marshes of the Sula. The whole is covered with 
a layer, 20 to 60 ft. thick, of boulder clay, which jigain is often 
mantled with a thick sheet of loess. Sandstone (sometimes 
suitable for grindstones) and limestone are quarried, and a few 
beds of gypsum and peat-bog are known within the government. 
With the exception of some sandy tracts, the soil is on the whole 
very fertile. Poltava is drained by the Dnieper, which flows 
along its border, navigable throughout, and by its tributaries 
the Sula, Psiol, Vorskla, Orel, Trubezh, and several others, 
none of them navigable, although their courses vary from 150 
to 270 m. each in length. Even those which used to be navigated 
within the historical period, such as the Trubezh and Supoi, 
are now drying up, while the others are being partially trans- 
formed into marshes. Deep sand-beds intersected by number- 
less ravines and old arms of the river stretch along the left 
bank of the Dnieper, where accordingly the settlements are 
few. Only 5% of the total area is under forest; timber, wooden 
wares, and pitch are imported. 



The estimated population in 1906 was 3,312,400. The great 
majority are Little Russians. Agriculture is the principal 
pursuit, 60% of the total area being arable land. The crops 
chiefly grown are wheat, rye and oats; the sunflower is largely 
cultivated, especially for oil, and the growing of tobacco, always 
important, has made a great advance. Kitchen gardening, 
the cultivation of the plum, and the preparation of preserved 
fruits are important branches of industry. At Lubny, where 
an apothecaries' garden is maintained by the Crown, the col- 
lection and cultivation ' of medicinal plants are a speciality. 
The main source of wealth in Poltava always has been, and still 
is, its live-stock breeding — horses, cattle, sheep, pigs. Some 
of the wealthier landowners and many peasants rear finer breeds 
of horses. The land is chiefly owned by the peasants, who 
possess 52% of the cultivable area; 42% belongs to private 
persons, and the remainder to the Crown, the clergy, and the 
municipalities. 

Among the manufactures distilleries hold the leading place, 
after which come flour-mills, tobacco factories, machine-making, 
tanneries, saw-mills, sugar-works and woollen manufactures. 
In the villages and towns several domestic trades are carried 
on, such as the preparation of sheepskins, plain woollen cloth, 
leather, boots and pottery. The fair of Poltava is of great 
importance for the whole woollen trade of Russia, and 
leather, cattle, horses, coarse woollen cloth, skins, and various 
domestic wares are exchanged for manufactures imported from 
Great Russia. The value of merchandise brought to the fair 
averages over £2,500,000. Several other fairs, the aggregate 
returns for which reach more than one-half of the above, are 
held at Romny (tobacco), Kremenchug '(timber, corn, tallow 
and salt), and Kobelyaki (sheepskins). Corn is exported to a 
considerable extent to the west and to Odessa, as also saltpetre, 
spirits, wool, tallow, skins and woollen cloth. The Dnieper is 
the principal artery for the exports and for the import — timber. 
The chief river-ports are Kremenchug and Poltava. Steamers 
ply between Kiev and Ekaterinoslav; but the navigation is 
hampered by want of water and becomes active only in the 
south. Traffic mostly follows the railway. Poltava is divided 
into fifteen districts, of which the chief towns are Poltava, 
Gadyaeh, Khorol, Kobelyaki, Konstantinograd, Kremenchug, 
Lokhvitsa, Lubny, Mirgorod, Pereyaslavl, Piryatin, Priluki, 
Romny, Zenkov and Zolotonosha. 

History. — At the dawn of Russian history the region now 
occupied by Poltava was inhabited by the Slav tribe of the 
Syeveryanes. As early as 988 the Russians erected several 
towns on the Sula and the Trubezh for their protection against 
the Turkish Petehenegs and Polovtsi, who held the south- 
eastern steppes. Population extended, and the towns of 
Pereyaslavl, Lubny, Priluki, Piryatin, Romny, begin to be 
mentioned in the nth and 12th centuries. The Mongol invasion 
of 1230-42 destroyed most of them, and for two centuries 
afterwards they disappear from Russian annals. About 133 1 
Gedimin, prince of Lithuania, annexed the so-called " Syeversk 
towns " and on the recognition of the union of Lithuania with 
Poland they were included in the united kingdom along with 
the remainder of Little Russia. In 1476 a separate principality 
of Kiev under Polish rule and Polish institutions was formed 
out of Little Russia, and remained so until the rising of the 
Cossack chief Bogdan Chmielnicki in 1654. By the Andrussowo 
Treaty, the left bank of the Dnieper being ceded to Russia, 
Poltava became part ' of the dominions of the Zaporogian 
Cossacks, and was divided into " regiments," six of which 
(Poltava, Pereyaslavl, Priluki, Gadyaeh, Lubny and Mirgorod) 
lay within the limits of the present government. They lost 
their independence in 1764. (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.) 

POLTAVA, a town of Russia, capital of the government of 
the same name, on the right bank of the Vorskla, SB m. by 
rail W.S.W. of Kharkov. Pop. 53,060. The town is built on 
a plateau which descends by steep slopes on nearly every side. 
Several suburbs, inhabited by Cossacks, whose houses are buried 
amid gardens, and a German colony, surround the town. The 
oldest buildings are a monastery, erected in 1650, and a wooden

church visited by Peter the Great after the battle of Poltava. 
There are a military school for cadets, a theological seminary 
and two girls' colleges; also flour-mills, tobacco works and a 
tannery. 

Poltava is mentioned in Russian annals in 1174, under the 
name of Ltava, but does not again appear in history until 1430, 
when, together with Glinsk, it was given by Gedimin, prince of 
Lithuania, to the Tatar prince Leksada. Under the Cossack 
chief, Bogdan Chmielnicki, it was the chief town of the Poltava 
" regiment." Peter the Great of Russia defeated Charles XII. 
of Sweden in the immediate neighbourhood on the 27th of June 
1709, and the victory is commemorated by a column over 50 ft. 
in height. 

POLTERGEIST (Ger. for "racketing spirit"), the term 
applied to certain phenomena of an unexplained nature, such 
as movements of objects without any traceable cause, and 
noises equally untraced to their source; but in some * cases 
exhibiting intelligence, as when raps answer a question by a 
code. In the word Poltergeist, the phenomena are attributed 
to the action of a Geist, or spirit: of old the popular explanation 
of all residuary phenomena. The hypothesis, in consequence 
of the diffusion of education, has been superseded by that of 
"electricity"; while sceptics in all ages and countries have 
accounted for all the phenomena by the theory of imposture. 
The last is at least a vera causa: imposture has often been 
detected; but it is not so certain that this theory accounts for all 
the circumstances. To the student of human nature the most 
interesting point in the character of poltergeist phenomena is 
their appearance in the earliest known stages of culture, their 
wide diffusion, and their astonishing uniformity. Almost all 
the beliefs usually styled " superstitious " are of early occurrence 
and of wide diffusion: the lowest savages believe in ghosts 
of the dead and in wraiths of the living. Such beliefs when 
found thriving in our own civilization might be explained as 
mere survivals from savagery, memories of all 

" The superstitions idle-headed eld 
Received and did deliver to our age." 

But we have not to deal only with a belief that certain 
apparently impossible things may occur and have occurred in 
the past. We are met by the evidence of sane and credible 
witnesses, often highly educated, who maintain that they 
themselves have heard and beheld the unexplained sounds and 
sights. It appears, therefore, that in considering the phenomena 
of the poltergeist we are engaged with facts of one sort or 
another; facts produced either by skilled imposture, or resting 
on hallucinations of the witnesses; or on a mixture of fraud 
and of hallucination caused by " suggestion." There remains 
the chance that some agency of an unexplored nature is, at least 
in certain cases, actually at work. 

A volume would be needed if we were to attempt to chronicle 
the phenomena of the poltergeist as believed in by savages 
and in ancient and medieval times. But among savages they are 
usually associated with the dead, or with the medicine-men of the 
tribes. These personages are professional " mediums," and like 
the mediums of Europe and America, may be said to have do- 
mesticated the poltergeist. At their seances, savage or civilized, 
the phenomena are reported to occur — such as rappings and 
other noises, loud or low, and " movements of objects without 
physical contact." (See, for a brief account, A. Lang, Cock 
Lane and Common Sense, " Savage Spiritualism "; and see the 
Jesuit Lettres Hifiantes, North America, 16 20-1 7 70, and 
Kohl's Kilchi Garni.) But " induced phenomena," where 
professional mediums and professional medical men are the 
agents, need not here be considered. The evidence, unless in 
the case of Sir William Crookes's experiments with Daniel Dunglas 
Home, is generally worthless, and the laborious investigations 
of the Society for Psychical Research resulted only in the 
detection of fraud as far as " physical " manifestations by 
paid mediums were concerned. 

The spontaneous poltergeist, where, at least, no professional 
is present, and no stance is being held, is much more curious and 



interesting than the simple tricks played in the dark by impudent 
charlatans. The phenomena are identical, as reported, literally 
"from China to Peru.". The Cieza de Leon (1549) tells us 
that the cacique of Pirza, in Popyan, during his conversion 
to Christianity, was troubled by stones falling mysteriously 
through the air (the mysterious point was the question of 
whence they came, and what force urged them), while Chris- 
tians saw at his table a glass of liquor raised in the air, by no 
visible hand, put down empty, and replenished! Mr Dennys 
(Folk Lore of China, 1876, p. 79) speaks of a Chinese householder 
who was driven to take refuge in a temple by the usual phenomena 
— throwing about of crockery and sounds of heavy footfalls — 
after the decease of an aggrieved monkey. This is only one of 
several Chinese cases of poltergeist; and the phenomena are 
described in Jesuit narratives of the 18th century, from Cochin 
China. In these papers no explanation is suggested. There 
is a famous example in a nunnery, recorded (1528) by a notable 
witness, Adrien de Montalembert, almoner to Francis I. The 
agent was supposed to be the spirit of a sister recently deceased. 

Among multitudes of old cases, that of the " Drummer of 
Tedworth " (1662-1663; see Glanvil, Sadducismus triumphatus, 
1666); that at Rerrick, recorded by the Rev. Mr Telfer 
in 1695; that of the Wesley household (17 16-17 17) chronicled 
in contemporary letters and diaries of the Wesley family 
(Southey's Life of John Wesley); tha^ of Cideville (1851), from 
the records of the court which tried the law-suit arising out of 
the affair (Proc. Soc. Psychical Research, xviii. 454-463); and 
the Alresford case, attested by the great admiral, Lord St 
Vincent, are among the most remarkable. At Tedworth we 
have the evidence of Glanvil himself, though it does not 
amount to much; at Rerrick, Telfer was a good chronicler 
and gives most respectable signed vouchers for all the marvels: 
Samuel Wesley and his wife were people of sense, they were 
neither alarmed nor superstitious, merely puzzled; while the 
court which tried the Cideville case, only decided that " the 
cause of the events remains unknown." At Alresford, in 
Hampshire, the phenomena attested by Lord St Vincent and 
his sister Mrs Ricketts, who occupied the house, were pecu- 
liarly strange and emphatic: the house was therefore pulled 
down. At Willington Mill, near Morpeth (1831-1847), the 
phenomena are attested by the journal of Mr Procter, the 
occupant, a Quaker, a " tee-totaller," and a man of great 
resolution. He and his family endured unspeakable things for 
sixteen years, and could find no explanation of the sights and 
sounds, among which were phantasms of animals, as at 
Ep worth, in the Wesley case. 

Of all these cases that of the Wesleys has attracted most 
critical attention. It was not, in itself, an extreme instance 
of poltergeist: at Alresford, at the close of the 18th century, 
and at Willington Mill in the middle of the 19th the disturbances 
were much more violent and persistent than at Ep worth, while 
our evidence is, in all three examples, derived from the contem- 
porary narratives, letters and journals of educated persons. 
The Wesleys, however, were people so celebrated and so active 
in religion that many efforts have been made to explain their 
" old Jeffrey," as they called the disturbing agency. These 
attempts at explanation have been fruitless. The poet Coleridge, 
who said that he knew many cases, explained all by a theory of 
contagious epidemic hallucination of witnesses. Dr Salmon, 
of Trinity College, Dublin, set all down to imposture by Hetty 
Wesley, a vivacious girl (Fortnightly Review, 1866). The ^ 
documents on which he relied, when closely studied, did not 
support his charges, for he made several important errors in 
dates, and on these his argument rested. F. Podmore, in several 
works (e.g. Studies in Psychical Research), adopted a theory 
of exaggerative memory in the narrators, as one element, 
with a dose of imposture and of hallucination begotten of 
excited expectation. The Wesley letters and journals, written 
from day to day, do not permit of exaggerative memory, and 
when the records of 1716-1717 are compared with the remini- 
scences collected from his family by John Wesley in 1726, the 
discrepancies are seen to be only such as occur in all human

evidence about any sort of events, remote by nine or ten 
years. Thus, in 1726, Mrs Wesley mentioned a visionary 
badger seen by her. She did not write about it to her son 
Samuel in 1717, but her husband and her daughter did then 
describe it to Samuel, as an experience of his mother at 
that date. The whole family, in 1717, became familiar with the 
phenomena, and were tired of them and of Samuel's questions. 
(Mr Podmore 's arguments are to be found in the Journal of the 
Studies of Psychical Research, ix. 40-45. Some dates are mis- 
printed.) The theory of hallucination cannot account for the 
uniformity of statements, in many countries and at many 
dates, to the effect that the objects mysteriously set in motion 
moved in soft curves and swerves, or " wobbled." Suppose 
that an adroit impostor is throwing them, suppose that the 
spectators are excited, why should their excitement every- 
where produce a uniform hallucination as to the mode of 
motion? It is better to confess ignorance, and remain in 
doubt, than to invent such theories. 

A modern instance may be analysed, as the evidence was 
given contemporaneously with the events (Podmore, Prac. 
Sac. Psychical Research, xii. 45-58: "Poltergeists"). On 
the 20th or 21st of February 1883 a Mrs White, in a 
cottage at Worksop, was " washing up the tea-things at the 
table," with two of her children in the room, when " the table 
tilted up at a considerable angle," to her amazement. On the 
26th of February, Mr White being from home, Mrs White 
extended hospitality to a girl, Eliza Rose, " the child of an 
imbecile mother." Eliza is later described as " half-witted," 
but no proof of this is given. On the 1st of March, White being 
from home, at about 11.30 p.m. a number of things " which had 
been in the kitchen a few minutes before " came tumbling down 
the kitchen stairs. Only Mrs White and Eliza Rose were then 
in the kitchen. Later some hot coals made an invasion. On 
the following night, White being at home in the kitchen, with his 
wife and Eliza, a miscellaneous throng of objects came in, 
Mr White made vain research upstairs, where was his brother 
Tom. On his return to the kitchen " a little china woman left 
the mantelpiece and flew into the corner." Being replaced, it 
repeated its flight, and was broken. White sent his brother to 
fetch a doctor; there also came a policeman, named Higgs; and 
the doctor and policeman saw, among other things, a basin and 
cream jug rise up automatically, fall on the floor and break. 
Next morning, a clock which had been silent for eighteen months 
struck; a crash was heard, and the clock was found to have 
leapt over a bed and fallen on the floor. All day many things 
kept flying about and breaking themselves, and Mr White sent 
Miss Rose about her business. Peace ensued. 

Mr Podmore, who visited the scene on the 7th and 8th of 
April and collected depositions, says (writing in 1883): "It 
may be stated generally that there was no possibility, in most 
cases, of the objects having been thrown by hand. . . . More- 
over it is hard to conceive by what mechanical appliances, 
under the circumstances described, the movements could have 
been effected. ... To suppose that these various objects 
were all moved by mechanical contrivances argues incredible 
stupidity, amounting almost to imbecility, on the part of all 
the persons present who were not in the plot," whereas Higgs, 
Dr Lloyd and a miner named Curass, all " certainly not wanting 
in intelligence," examined the objects and could find no explana- 
tion. White attested that fresh invasions of the kitchen by 
inanimate objects occurred as Eliza was picking up the earlier 
arrivals; and he saw a salt-cellar fly from the table while Eliza 
was in another part of the room. The amount of things broken 
was valued by White at £9. No one was in the room when the 
clock struck and fell. Higgs saw White shut the cupboard 
doors, they instantly burst open, and a large glass jar flew into 
the yard and broke. " The jar could not go in a straight line 
from the cupboard out of the door; but it certainly did go" 
(Higgs). The depositions were signed by the witnesses (April 
1883). 

In 1896, Mr Podmore, after thirteen years of experience 
in examining reports of the poltergeist, produced his explana- 



tions. (1) The witnesses, though " honest and fairly intelli- 
gent," were " imperfectly educated, not skilled in accurate 
observation of any kind." (They described, like many others, 
in many lands, the " wobbling " movement of objects in flight.) 
(2) Mr Podmore took the evidence five weeks after date; there 
was time for exaggerated memories. (Mr Podmore did not 
consult, it seems, the contemporary evidence of Higgs in the 
Retford and Gainsborough Times, 9th of March 1883. On 
examination it proves to tally as precisely as possible with the 
testimonies which he gave to Mr Podmore, except that in March 
he mentioned one or two miracles which he omitted five weeks 
later! The evidence is published in Lang's The Making of 
Religion, 1898, p. 356.) (3) In the evidence given to Mr Podmore 
five weeks after date, there are discrepancies between Higgs and 
White as to the sequence of some events, and as to whether 
one Coulter was present when the clock fell: he asserts, Higgs 
and White deny it . (There is never evidence of several witnesses, 
five weeks after an event, without such discrepancies. If there 
were, the evidence would be suspected as " cooked." Higgs 
in April gave the same version as in March.) (4) As there 
are discrepancies, the statements that Eliza was not always 
present at the abnormal occurrences may be erroneous. " It 
is perhaps not unreasonable to conjecture that Eliza Rose herself, 
as the instrument of mysterious agencies, or simply as a half- 
witted girl gifted with abnormal cunning and love of mischief, 
may have been directly responsible for all that took place." 
{How, if, as we have seen, the theory of mechanical appliances 
is abandoned, " under the circumstances described " ? We need 
to assume that all the circumstances are wrongly described. 
Yet events did occur, the breakages were lamentable, and we 
ask how could the most half-witted of girls damage so much 
property undetected, under the eyes of the owner, a policeman, 
a medical practitioner and others? How could she throw things 
from above into the room where she was picking up the things 
as they arrived? Or is that a misdescription? No evidence 
of Eliza's half-wittedness and abnormal cunning is adduced. 
If we call her "the instrument of mysterious agencies," the 
name of these agencies is — poltergeist! No later attempt to 
find and examine the abnormal girl is recorded.) 

The explanations are not ideally satisfactory, but they are the 
result, in Mr Podmore's mind, of examination of several later 
cases of poltergeist. 1 In one a girl, carefully observed, was 
detected throwing things, and evidence that the phenomena 
occurred, in her absence, at another place and time, is discounted. 
In several other cases, exaggerations of memory, malobservation 
and trickery combined, are the explanations, and the conclu- 
sion is that there is " strong ground " for believing in trickery 
as the true explanation of all these eleven cases, including 
the Worksop affair. Mr Podmore asserts that, at Worksop, 
" the witnesses did not give their testimony until some weeks 
after the event." That is an erroneous statement as far as Higgs 
goes, the result apparently of malobservation of the local news- 
paper. More or less of the evidence was printed in the week 
when the events occurred. Something more than unconscious 
exaggeration, or malobservation, seems needed to explain the 
amazing statements made by Mr Newman, a gamekeeper of 
Lord Portman, on the 23rd of January 1895, at Durmeston in 
another case. Among other things, he said that on the 18th 
of December 1894, a boot flew out of a door. " I went and put 
my foot on the boot and said ' I defy anything to move- this 
boot.' Just as I stepped off, it rose up behind me and knocked 
my hat off. There was nobody behind me." Gamekeepers are 
acute observers, and if the narrative be untrue, malobservation 
or defect of memory does not explain the fact. In this case, 
at Durmeston, the rector, Mr Anderson, gave an account of 

1 The present writer criticized Mr Podmore's explanation in 
The Making of Religion. Mr Podmore replied (Proc. Soc. Psychical 
Research^ xiv. 13J, 136), pointing out an error in the critic's 
presentation of his meaning. He, in turn, said that the writer 
* champions the supernormal interpretation," which is not exact, 
as the writer has no theory on the subject, though he is not 
satisfied that " a naughty little girl " is a uniformly successful 
solution of the poltergeist problem.

some of the minor phenomena. He could not explain them, and 
gave the best character to the Nonconformist mother of the 
child with whom the events were associated. No trickery 
was discovered. 

The phenomena are frequently connected with a person, 
often a child, suffering from nervous malady or recent nervous 
shock. No such person appears in the Alresford, Willing ton, 
Ep worth and Tedworth cases, and it is not stated that Eliza 
Rose at Worksop was subjected to a medical examination. In 
a curious case, given by Mrs Crewe, in The Night Side of Nature, 
the young person was the daughter of a Captain Molesworth. 
Her own health was bad, and she had been depressed by the 
death of a sister. Captain Molesworth occupied a semi-detached 
villa at Trinity, near Edinburgh; his landlord lived next door. 
The phenomena set in: the captain bored holes in the wall to 
discover a cause in trickery, and his landlord brought a suit 
against him in the sheriff's court at Edinburgh. 

The papers are preserved, but the writer found that to 
discover them would be a herculean labour. He saw, how- 
ever, a number of documents in the office of a firm of 
solicitors employed in the case. They proved the fact of the 
lawsuit but threw no other light on the matter. We often 
find that the phenomena occur after a nervous shock to the 
person who may be called the medium. The shock is frequently 
consequent on a threat from a supposed witch or wizard. This 
was the case at Cidcville in 1850-1851. (See an abstract of the 
documents of the trial, Proceedings S.P.R. xviii. 454-463. 
The entire report was sent to the writer.) In 1901 there 
was a case at Great Grimsby; the usual flying of stones 
and other objects occurred. The woman of the house had been 
threatened by a witch, after that the poltergeist developed. 
No explanation was forthcoming. In Proc. S.P.R. xvii. 
3 20 the Rev. Mr Deanley gives a curious parallel case 
with detection "of imposture. In Miss O'Neal's Devonshire 
Idylls is an excellent account of the phenomena which occurred 
after a Devonshire girl of the best character, well known to Miss 
O'Neal, had been threatened by a witch. In the famous instance 
of Christian Shaw of Bargarran (1697) the child had been thrice 
formally cursed by a woman, who prayed to God that her soul 
" might be hurled through hell." Christian fell into a state 
which puzzled the medical faculty (especially when she floated 
in the air), and doubtless she herself caused, in an hysterical 
state, many phenomena which, however, were not precisely 
poltergeistish. A very marked set of phenomena, in the way 
of movements of objects, recently occurred in the Hudson Bay 
territory, after a half-breed girl had received a nervous shock 
from a flash of lightning that struck near her. Heavy weights 
automatically " tobogganed," as Red Indian spectators said, 
and there were the usual rappings in tent and wigwam. If we 
accept trickery as the sufficient explanation, the uniformity of 
tricks played by hysterical patients is very singular. Still 
more singular is a long series, continued through several years, 
of the same occurrences where no hysterical patient is known to 
exist. In a very curious example, a carpenter's shop being the 
scene, there was concerned nobody of an hysterical temperament, 
ho young boy or girl, and there was no explanation (Proc. S.P.R. 
vii* 3 8 3-394)- The events went on during six weeks. 
An excellent case of hysterical fraud by a girl in France is given 
by Dr Grasset, professor of clinical medicine at Montpellier (Proc. 
S.P.R. xviii. 464-480). But in this instance, though things 
were found in unusual places, nobody over eight years old saw 
them flying about; yet all concerned were deeply superstitious. 

On the whole, while fraud, especially hysterical fraud, is a 
vera causa in some cases of poltergeist, it is not certain that the 
explanation fits all cases, and it is certain that detection of 
fraud has often been falsely asserted, as at Tedworth and 
Willington. No good chronic case, as at Alresford, Epworth, 
Spraiton <Bo vet's P andaemonium) , Willington, and in other 
classical instances, has been for months sedulously observed by 
sceptics. In short-lived cases, as at Worksop, science appears 
on the scene long enough after date to make the theory of 
exaggeration of memory plausible. If we ask science to explain 



how the more remarkable occurrences could be produced by a 
girl ex hypothese half-witted, the reply is that the occurrences 
never occurred, they were only "described as occurring" by 
untrained observers with " patent double magnifying " memo- 
ries; and with a capacity for being hallucinated in a uniform 
way all the world over. Yet great quantities of crockery 
and furniture were broken, before the eyes of observers, in a 
house near Ballarmina, in North Ireland, in January 1907. 
The experiment of exhibiting a girl who can break all the 
crockery without being detected, in the presence of a doctor 
and a policeman, and who can, at the same time, induce the 
spectators to believe that the flying objects waver, swerve and 
" wobble," has not been attempted. 

An obvious difficulty in the search for authentic information 
is the circumstance that the poor and imperfectly educated are 
much more numerous than the well-to-do and well educated. 
It is therefore certain that most of the disturbances will occur 
in the houses of the poor and ill educated, and that their evidence 
will be rejected as insufficient. When an excellent case occurs 
in a palace, and is reported by the margravine of Bayreuth, sister 
of Frederick the Great, in her Memoirs, the objection is that her 
narrative was written long after the events. When we have 
contemporary journals and letters, or sworn evidence, as in the 
affairs of Sir Philip Francis, Cideville and Willington, criticism 
can probably find some other good reasons for setting these 
testimonies aside. It is certain that the royal, the rich and the 
well-educated observers tell, in many cases, precisely the same 
sort of stories about poltergeist phenomena as do the poor and 
the imperfectly instructed. 

On the theory that there exist " mysterious agencies " which 
now and then produce the phenomena, we may ask what these 
agencies can possibly be? But no answer worthy of considera- 
tion has ever been given to this question. The usual reply is 
that some unknown but intelligent force is disengaged from the 
personality of the apparent medium. This apparent medium 
need not be present; he or she may be far away. The High- 
landers attribute many poltergeist phenomena, inexplicable noises, 
sounds of viewless feet that pass, and so forth, to tdradh, an 
influence exerted unconsciously by unduly strong wishes on the 
part of a person at a distance. The phrase falbh air fdrsaing 
(" going uncontrolled ") is also used (Campbell, Witchcraft and 
Second Sight in the Scottish Highlands, 1902, pp. 144-147). The 
present writer is well acquainted with cases attributed to 
Idradh, in a house where he has often been a guest. They excite 
no alarm, their cause being well understood. We may call this 
kind of thing telethoryby, a racket produced from, a distance. 
A very marked case in Illinois would have been attrihuted in 
the Highlands to the tdradh of the late owner of the house, a 
dipsomaniac in another state. On his death the disturbances 
ceased (first-hand evidence from the disturbed lady of the 
house, May 1907). It may be worth while to note that the 
phenomena are often regarded as death-warnings by popular 
belief. The early incidents at the Wesleys' house were thought 
to indicate the death of a kinsman; or to announce the approach- 
ing decease of Mr Wesley pere, who at first saw and heard 
nothing unusual. At Worksop the doctor was called in, because 
the phenomena were guessed to be " warnings " of the death 
of a sick child of the house. The writer has first-hand 
evidence from a lady and her son (afterwards a priest) of 
very singular movements of untouched objects in their presence, 
which did coincide with the death of a relation at a distance.

may be consulted, and Bovet's Pandaemoniutn (1684) is very rich 
in cases. The literature of the famous drummer of Tedworth 
(March 1662-April 1663) begins with an abstract of the sworn 
deposition of Mr Mompesson, whose house was the scene of the dis- 
turbances. The abstract is in the Mercurius publicus of April 
1663, the evidence was given in a court of justice on the 15th of April. 
There is also a, ballad, a rhymed news-sheet of 1662 (Anthony 
Wood's Collection 401 (193), Bodleian Library). Pepys mentions 
" books " about the affair in his Diary for June 1663. Glanvil's 
first known version is in his Sadductsvius triumphatus of 1666. 
The sworn evidence of Mompesson proves at least that he was 
disturbed in an intolerable manner, certainly beyond any means 
at the disposal of his two daughters, aged nine and eleven or there- 
abouts. The agent may have been the tdradh of the drummer 
whom Mompesson offended. t Glanvil in 1666 confused the dates, 
and, save for his own experiences, merely repeats the statements 
cuncnt in 1662-1663. The ballad and Mompesson 's deposition 
arc given in Proc. S.P.R. xvii. 304-336, in a discussion between 
the writer and Mr Podmore. The dated and contemporary 
narrative of Procter in the Willington Mill case (1835- 
1847), is printed in the Journ. S.P.R. (Dec. 1892), with some 
contemporary letters on the subject. Mr Procter endured the 
disturbances for sixteen years before he retreated from the 
place. There was no naughty little girl in the affair; no nervous 
or hysterical patient. _ The Celtic hypothesis of tHradh, exercised 
by " the spirit of the living," includes visual apparitions, and many 
a* so-called " ghost " of the dead may be merely the t&radh of a 
living person. (A. L.) 

POLTROON, a coward, a worthless rogue without courage or 
spirit. The word comes through Fr. poltron from Ital. poltrone, 
an idle fellow, one who lolls in a bed or couch (Milanese poller, 
Venetian poltrona, adapted from Ger. Polster, a pillow; cf. 
English " bolster")* The old guess that it was from Lat. pollice 
truncus, maimed in the thumb, and was first applied to those 
who avoided military service hy self-mutilation, gave rise 
probably to the French application of poltron to a falcon whose 
talons were cut to prevent its attacking game. 

POLTROT, JEAN DE (c. 153 7-1 56*,), sieur de Mere or Merey, 
a nobleman of Angoumois, who murdered Francis, duke of Guise. 
He had lived some time in Spain, and his knowledge of Spanish, 
together with his swarthy complexion, which earned him the 
nickname of the " Espagnolet," procured him employment as a 
spy in the wars against Spain. Becoming a fanatical Huguenot, 
he determined to kill the duke of Guise, and gained admission 
as a deserter to the camp of the Catholics who were besieging 
Orleans. In the evening of the 18th of February 1563 he hid 
by the side of a road along which he knew the duke would pass, 
fired a pistol at him, and fled. But he was captured the next day, 
and was tried, tortured several times, and sentenced to be drawn 
and quartered. On the 18th of March 1563 he underwent a 
frightful punishment. The horses not heing able to drag off his 
limbs, he was hacked to pieces with cutlasses. He had made 
several contradictory declarations regarding the complicity of 
Coligny. The admiral protested emphatically against the 
accusation, which appears to have had no foundation.

POLYAENUS, a Macedonian, who lived at Rome as a rhetori- 
cian and pleader in the 2nd century a.d. When the Parthian War 
(162-5) broke out, Polyaenus, too old to share in the campaign, 
dedicated to the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus a 
work, still extant, called Strategica or Strategemata, a historical 
collection of stratagems and maxims of strategy written in Greek 
and strung together in the form of anecdotes. It is not strictly 
confined to warlike stratagems, but includes also examples of 
wisdom, courage and cunning drawn from civil and political life. 
The work is uncritically written, but is nevertheless important on 
account of the extracts it has preserved from histories now lost. 
It is divided into eight books (parts of the sixth and seventh 
are lost), and originally contained nine hundred anecdotes, 
of which eight hundred and thirty-three are extant. Polyaenus 
intended to write a history of the Parthian War, hut there is no 
evidence that he did so. His works on Macedonia, on Thebes, 
and on tactics (perhaps identical with the Strategica)' are lost. 

His Strategica seems to have been highly esteemed by the Roman 
emperors, and to have been handed down by them as a sort of 



heirloom. From Rome it passed to Constantinople; at the end of 
the 9th century it was diligently studied by Leo VI ., who himself 
wrote a work on tactics;and in the middle of the 10th century 
Constant ine Porphyrogenitus mentioned it as one of the most 
valuable books in the imperial library. It was used by Stobaeus, 
Suidas, and the anonymous author of the work Utpl &ttI<ttwv (see 
Palaepiiatus). It is arranged as follows: bks. 1., ii., iii., strata- 
gems occurring in Greek history; bk. iv., stratagems of the Mace- 
donian kings and successors of Alexander the Great; bk. v., strata- 
gems occurring in the history of Sicily and the Greek islandsand 
colonies; bk. vi., stratagems of a whole people (Carthaginians, 
Lacedaemonians, Argives), together with some individuals 
(Philooocmen, Pyrrhus, Hannibal); bk. vii., stratagems of the 
barbarians (Medes, Persians, Egyptians, Thracians, Scythians, 
Celts); bk. viii., stratagems of Romans- and women. This dis- 
tribution is not, however, observed very strictly. Of the negligence 
or haste with which the work was written there are many instances: 
e.g. he confounds Dionysius the elder and Dionysius the younger, 
Mithradates satrap of Artaxcrxes and Mithradates the Great, 
Scipio the elder and Scipio the younger, Perseus, king of Macedonia 
and Perseus the companion of Alexander; he mixes up the strata- 
gems of Caesar and Pompey; he brings into immediate connexion 
events which were totally distinct; he narrates some events twice 
over, with variations according to the different authors from whom 
he draws. Though he usually abridges, he occasionally amplifies 
arbitrarily the narratives of his authorities. He never mentions 
his authorities, but amongst authors still extant he used Herodotus, 
Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, Diodorus, Plutarch, Front inus 
and Suetonius; amongst authors cf whom only fragments now 
remain he drew upon Ctesias, Ephorus, Timaeus, Phylarchus and 
Nicolaus Damascenus. His style is clear, but monotonous and 
inelegant. In the forms of his words he generally follows Attic 
usage.

POLYANDRY (Gr. irokvs, many, and avrjp, man), the system 
of marriage between one woman and several men, who are her 
husbands exclusively (see Family). The custom locally legal- 
izing the marriage of one woman to more than one hushand at a 
time has been variously accounted for as the result of poverty and 
of life in unfertile lands, where it was essential to check popula- 
tion as the consequence of female infanticide, or, in the opinion 
of J. F. McLennan and L. H. Morgan, as a natural phase through 
which human progress has necessarily passed. Polyandry is to 
be carefully differentiated from communal marriage, where the 
woman is the property of any and every member of the tribe. 
Two distinct kinds of polyandry are practised: one, often cafled 
Nair, in which, as among the Nairs of India, the husbands are 
not related to each other; and the second, the Tihetan or fraternal 
polyandry, in which the woman is married to all the brothers of 
one family. Polyandry is practised by the tribes of Tihet, 
Kashmir and the Himalayan regions, by the Todas, Koorgs, 
Nairs and other peoples of India, in Ceylon, New Zealand, by 
some of the Australian aborigines, in parts of Africa, in the 
Aleutian archipelago, among the Koryaks and on the Orinoco.

POLYANTHUS, one of the oldest of the florists' flowers, is 
probably derived from P. variabilis, itself a cross between the 
common primrose and the cowslip; it differs from the primrose in 
having the umbels of flowers carried up on a stalk. The florists' 
polyanthus has a golden margin, and is known as the gold-laced 
polyanthus, the properties being very distinctly laid down and 
rigidly adhered to. The chief of these are a clear, unshaded, 
blackish or reddish ground colour, an even margin or lacing of 
yellow extending round each segment and cutting through its 
centre down to the ground colour, and a yellow band surrounding 
the tube of exactly the same hue as the yellow of the lacing. The 
plants are quite hardy, and grow best in strong, loamy soil 
tolerably well enriched with well-decayed dung and leaf-mould;

they should be planted about the end of September or not 
later than October. Plants for exhibition present a much 
better and cleaner appearance if kept during winter in a cold 
well-aired frame. 

For the flower borders what are called fancy polyanthuses are 
adopted. These are best raised annually from seed, the young 
crop each year blooming in succession. The seed should be 
sown as soon as ripe, the young plants being allowed to stand 
through the winter in the seed bed. In April or May they are 
planted out in a bed of rich garden soil, and they will bloom 
abundantly the following spring. A few of the better " thrum- 
eyed " sorts (those having the anthers in the eye, and the pistil 
sunk in the tube) should be allowed to ripen seed; the rest may be 
thrown away. In some remarkable forms which have been 
cultivated for centuries the ordinarily green calyx has become 
petaloid; when this is complete it forms the hose-in-hose prim- 
rose of gardeners. There are also a few well-known double- 
flowered varieties. 

POLYBIUS (c. 204-122 B.C.), Greek historian, was a native of 
Megalopolis in Arcadia, the youngest of Greek cities (Paus. viii. 
9), which, however, played an honourable part in the last days of 
Greek freedom as a stanch member of the Achaean League (q.v.). 
His father, Lycortas, was the intimate friend of Philopoemen, and 
on the death of the latter, in 182, succeeded him as leader of the 
league. The date of Polybius's birth is doubtful. He tells us 
himself that in 181 he had not yet reached the age (? thirty years, 
Polyb. xxix. 9) at which an Achaean was legally capable of 
holding office (xxiv. 6). We learn from Cicero (Ad Fam. v. 12) 
that he outlived the Numantine War, which ended [in 132, and 
from Lucian (Macrob. 22) that he died at the age of eighty-two. 
The majority of authorities therefore place his birth between 
214 and 204 B.C. Little is known of his early life. As the son of 
Lycortas he was naturally brought into close contact with the 
leading men 'of the Achaean League. With Philopoemen he 
seems to have been on intimate terms. After Philopoemen's 
tragic death in Messenia (182) he was entrusted with the honour- 
able duty of conveying home the urn in which his ashes had been 
deposited (Plut. Phil. 21). In 181, together with his father, 
Lycortas and the younger Aratus, he was appointed, in spite of 
his youth, a member of the embassy which was to visit Ptolemy 
Epiphanes, king of Egypt, a mission, however, which the sudden 
death of Ptolemy brought to a premature end (xxv. 7). The 
next twelve years of his life are a blank, but in 169 he reappears 
as a trusted adviser of the Achaeans at a difficult crisis in the 
history of the League. In 1 7 1 war had broken out between Rome 
and the Macedonian king Perseus, and the Achaean statesmen 
were divided as to the policy to be pursued; there were good 
reasons for fearing that the Roman senate would regard neu- 
trality as indicating a secret leaning towards Macedon. Polybius 
therefore declared for an open alliance with Rome, and his views 
were adopted. It was decided to send an Achaean force to co- 
operate with the Roman general, and Polybius was selected to 
command the cavalry. The Roman consul declined the proffered 
assistance, but Poiybius accompanied him throughout the 
campaign, and thus gained his first insight into the military 
system of Rome. In the next year (168) both Lycortas and 
Polybius were on the point of starting at the head of 1200 
Achaeans to take service in Egypt against the Syrians, when an 
intimation from the Roman commander that armed inter- 
ference was undesirable put a stop to the expedition (xxix. 23). 
The success of Rome in the war with Perseus was now assured. 
The final victory was rapidly followed by the arrival in Achaea 
of Roman commissioners charged with the duty of establishing 
Roman interests there. Polybius was arrested with 1000 of 
the principal Achaeans, but, while his companions were con- 
demned to a tedious incarceration in the country towns of Italy, 
he obtained permission to reside in Rome. This privilege. he 
owed to the influence of L. Aemilius Paullus and his two sons, 
Scipio and Fabius (xxxii. 9). Polybius was received into Aemi- 
lius's house, and became the instructor of his sons. Between 
Scipio (P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus the younger), the future 
conqueror of Carthage, and himself a friendship soon sprang up, 



which ripened into a lifelong intimacy, and was of inestimable 
service to him throughout his career. It protected him from 
interference, opened to him the highest circles of Roman society, 
and enabled him to acquire a personal influence with the leading 
men, which stood him in good stead when he afterwards came 
forward to mediate between his countrymen and Rome. It 
placed within his reach opportunities for a close study of Rome 
and the Romans such as had fallen to no historian before him, 
and secured him the requisite leisure for using them, while 
Scipio's liberality more than once supplied him with the means of 
conducting difficult and costly historical investigations (Pliny, 
N.H. v. 9). In 151 the few surviving exiles were allowed to 
return to Greece. But the stay of Polybius in Achaea was brief. 
The estimation in which he was held at Rome is clearly shown 
by the anxiety of the consul Marcus (or Manlius) Manilius (149) 
to take him as his adviser on his expedition against Carthage. 
Polybius started to join him, but broke off his journey at Corcyra 
on learning that the Carthaginians were inclined to yield (xxxvi. 
3). But when, in 147, Scipio himself took the command in 
Africa, Polybius hastened to join him, and was an eye-witness 
of the siege and destruction of Carthage. During his absence in 
Africa the Achaeans had made a last desperate attempt to 
assert their independence of Rome. He returned in 146 to find 
Corinth in ruins, the fairest cities of Achaea at the mercy of the 
Roman soldiery, and the famous Achaean League shattered to 
pieces (see Achaean Leacue). All the influence he possessed 
was freely spent in endeavouring to shield his countrymen from 
the worst consequences of their rashness. The excesses of the 
soldiery were checked, and at his special intercession the statues 
of Aratus and Philopoemen were preserved (xxxix. 14). An 
even more difficult task was that entrusted to him by the 
Roman authorities themselves, of persuading the Achaeans to 
acquiesce in the new regime imposed upon them by their con- 
querors, and of setting the new machinery in working order. 
With this work, which he accomplished so as to earn the heartfelt 
gratitude of his countrymen (xxxix. 16), his public career seems 
to have closed. The rest of his life was, so far as we know, 
devoted to the great history which is the lasting monument of 
his fame. He died, at the age of eighty-two, of a fall from his 
horse (Lucian, Macrob. 22). The base of a statue erected to 
him by Elis was found at Olympia in 1877. It bears the inscrip- 
tion i) 7r6Xts 7? 'HXaow TLdkvfiiov AvK6pra ^leyakoiro\irr]v. 

Of the forty books which made up the history of Polybius, the 
first five alone have come down to us in a complete form ; of the rest 
we have only more or less copious fragments. But the general 
plan and scope of the work are explained by Polybius himself. 
His intention was to make plain how and why it was that " all the 
known regions of the civilized world had fallen under the sway 
of Rome (iii. 1). This empire of Rome, unprecedented in its 
extent and still more so in the rapidity with which it had been ac- 
quired, was the standing wonder of the age, and " who," he exclaims 
(1. 1), " is so poor-spirited or indolent as not to wish to know by 
what means, and thanks to what sort of constitution, the Romans 
subdued the world in something less than fifty-three years?" 
These fifty-three years are those between 220 (the point at which 
the work of Aratus ended) and 168 B.C., and extend therefore 
f" ora the outbreak of the Hannibalic War to the defeat of Perseus 
at Pydna. To this period then the main portion of his history 
is devoted from the third to the thirtieth book inclusive. But 
for clearness' sake he prefixes in bks. i. and ii. such a preliminary 
sketch of the earlier history of Rome, of the First Punic War, and 
of the contemporary events in Greece and Asia, as will enable his 
readers more fully to understand what follows. This seems to 
have been his original plan, but at the opening of bk. Hi., written 
apparently after 146, he explains that he thought it desirable to 
add some account of the manner in which the Romans exercised 
the power they had won, of their temperament and policy and of 
the final catastrophe which destroyed Carthage and for ever broke 
np the Achaean League (iii. 4, 5). To this appendix, giving the 
history from 168-146, the last ten books are devoted. 

Whatever fault may be found with Polybius, there can be no 
question that he had formed a high conception of the task before 
him. He lays repeated stress on two qualities as distinguishing 
his history from the ordinary run of historical compositions. The 
first of these, its synoptic character, was partly necessitated by the 
nature of the period. The various states fringing the basin of the 
Mediterranean had become so inextricably interwoven that # it 
was no longer possible to deal with them in isolation. Polybius 
therefore claims for his history that it will take a comprehensive 



POLYBIUS 



x 9 



view of the whole course of events in the civilized world, within 
the limits of the period (i. 4). He thus aims at placing before his 
readers at each stage a complete survey of the field of action from 
Spain to Syria and Egypt. This synoptic method proceeds from 
a true appreciation of what is now called the unity of history, and 
to Polybius must be given the credit of having first firmly grasped 
and clearly enforced a lesson which the events of his own time 
were especially well calculated to teach. It is the great merit 
of his work that it gives such a picture of the 2nd and 3rd centuries 
B.C. as no series of special narratives could have supplied. 

The second quality upon which Polybius insists as distinguishing 
his history from all others is its " pragmatic " character. It deals, 
that is, with events and with their causes, and aims at an accurate 
record and explanation of ascertained facts. This " pragmatic 
method " (ix. 2) makes history intelligible by explaining the how 
and the why; and, secondly, it is only when so written that history 
can perform its true function of instructing and guiding those who 
study it. For the great use of history, according to Polybius, is to 
contribute to the right conduct of human life (i. 35). But this 
it can do only if the historian bears in mind the true nature of his 
task. He must remember that the historian should not write as 
the dramatist does to charm or excite his audience for the moment 
(ii. 56). He will aim simply at exhibiting events in their true 
light, setting forth " the why and the how " in each case, not 
confusing causes and occasions, or dragging in old wives' fables, 
prodigies and marvels (ii. 16, iii. 48). Hewill omit nothing which 
can help to explain the events he is dealing with : the genius and 
temperament of particular peoples, their political and military 
systems, the characters of the leading men, the geographical features 
of the country, must all be taken into account. To this conception 
of history Polybius is on the whole consistently faithful. It is 
true that his anxiety to instruct leads often to a rather wearisome 
iteration of his favourite maxims, and that his digressions, such 
as that on the military art, are occasionally provokingly long and 
didactic. But his comments and reflections are for the most part 
sound and instructive (e.g. those on the lessons to be learnt from 
the revolt of the mercenaries in Africa, i. 65; from the Celtic raids 
in Italy, ii. 35 ; and on the Roman character), while among his digres- 
sions are included such invaluable chapters as those on the Roman 
constitution (bk. vi), the graphic description of Cisalpine Gaul 
(bk* ii.) and the account of the rise and constitution of the Achaean 
League (ii. 38 seq.). To his anxiety again to trace back events 
to their first causes we owe, not only the careful inquiry (bk. iii.) 
into the origin of the Second Punic War, but the sketch of early 
Roman history in bk. i., and of the early treaties between Rome 
and Carthage in iii. 22 seq. Among the many defects which he 
censures in previous historians, not the least serious in his eyes 
are their inattention to the political and geographical surroundings 
of the history (ii. 16, iii. 36), and their neglect duly to set forth the 
causes of events (iii. 6). 

Polybius is equally explicit as regards the personal qualifications 
necessary for a good historian, and in this respect too his practice is 
in close agreement with histheory.^ Without a personal knowledge 
of affairs a writer will inevitably distort the true relations and im- 
portance of events (xii. 28). Such experience would have saved 
accomplished and fluent Greek writers like Timaeus from many 
of their blunders (xii. 25a), but the shortcomings of Roman soldiers 
and senators like Q. Fabius Pictor show that it is not enough by 
itself. Equally indispensable is careful painstaking research. All 
available evidence must be collected, thoroughly sifted, soberly 
weighed, and, lastly, the^ historian must be animated by a sincere 
love of truth and a calm impartiality. 

It is important to consider how far Polybius himself comes up 
to his standard. In his personal acquaintance with affairs, in the 
variety of his experience, and in his opportunities for forming a 
correct judgment on events he is without a rival among ancient 
historians. A great part of the period of which he treats fell within 
his own lifetime (iv. 2). He may just have remembered the battle 
of Cynoscephalae (197), and, as we have seen, he was actively 
engaged in the military and political affairs of the Achaean League. 
During his exile in Rome he was able to study the Roman constitu- 
tion, and the peculiarities of the Roman temperament; he made 
the acquaintance of Roman senators, and became the intimate 
friend of the greatest Roman of the day. Lastly, he was able to 
survey with his own eyes the field on which the great struggle 
between Rome and Hannibal was fought out. He left Rome 
only to witness the crowning triumph of Roman arms in Africa, 
and to gain a practical acquaintance with Roman methods of 
government by assisting in the settlement of Achaea. When, in 
146, his public life closed, he completed his preparation of himself 
for his great work by laborious investigations of archives and monu- 
ments, and by a careful personal examination of historical* sites and 
scenes. To all this we must add that he was deeply read in the 
learning of his day, above all in the writings of earlier historians. 

b Of Polybius's anxiety to get at the truth no better proof can be 
given than his conscientious investigation of original documents 
and monuments, and his careful study of geography and topography 
— both of them points in which his predecessors^ as well as his 
successor Livy, conspicuously failed. Polybius is careful con- 
stantly to remind us that he writes for those who are 4>iXona9eU 



lovers of 'knowledge, with whom truth is the first consideration. 
He closely studied the bronze tablets in Rome on which were in- 
scribed the early treaties concluded between Romans and Cartha- 
ginians. He quotes the actual language of the treaty which ended 
the First Punic War (i. 62), and of that between Hannibal and Philip 
of Macedon (vii. 9). In xvi, 15 he refers to a document which he 
had personally inspected in the archives at Rhodes, and in iii. 33 
to the monument on the Lacinian promontory, recording the 
number of Hannibal's forces. According to Dionysius, i. 17, he 
got his date for the foundation of Rome from a tablet in the pontifical 
archives. As instances of his careful attention to geography and 
topography we have not only the fact of his widely extended travels, 
from the African coast and the Pillars of Hercules in the west, to 
the Euxine and the coasts of Asia Minor in the east, but also the 
geographical and topographical studies scattered throughout his 
history. 

Next to the duty of original research, Polybius ranks that of 
impartiality. Some amount of bias in favour of one's own country 
may, he thinks, be pardoned as natural (xvi. 14) ; but it is unpardon- 
able, he says, for the historian to set anything whatever above the 
truth. And on the whole, Polybius must be allowed here again 
to have practised what he preached. It is true that his affection 
for and pride in Arcadia appear in more than one passage (iv. 20, 
21). as also does his dislike of the Aetolians (ii. 45, iv. 3, 16). His 
treatment of Aratus and Philopoemen, the heroes of the Achaean 
League, and of Cleomenes of Sparta, its most constant enemy, is 
perhaps open to severer criticism. Certainly CJeomenes does not 
receive full justice at his hands. Similarly his views of Rome 
and the Romans may have been influenced by his firm belief in 
the necessity of accepting the Roman supremacy as inevitable, 
and by his intimacy with Scipio. He had a deep admiration for 
the great republic, for her well-balanced constitution, for her military 
system, and for the character of her citizens. ^ But just as his 
patriotism does not blind him to the faults and follies of his country- 
men (xxxviii. 4, 5, 6), so he does not scruple to criticize Rome. 
He notices the incipient degeneracy of Rome after 146 (xviii. 35). 
He endeavours to hold the balance evenly between Rome and 
Carthage; he strongly condemns the Roman occupation of Sardinia 
as a breach of faith (iii. 28, 31); and he does full justice to 
Hannibal. Moreover, there can be no doubt that he sketched the 
Roman character in a masterly fashion. 

^ His interest in the study of character and his skill in its delinea- 
tion are everywhere noticeable. He believes, indeed, in an over- 
ruling fortune, which guides the course of events. It is fortune 
which has fashioned anew the face of the world in his own time 
(iv. 2), which has brought the whole civilized world into subjection 
to Rome (i. 4) ; and the Roman Empire itself is the most marvellous 
of her works (viii. 4). But under fortune not only political and 
geographical conditions but the characters and temperaments of 
nations and individuals play their part. The Romans had been 
fitted by their previous struggles for the conquest of the world 
(i. 63) ; they were chosen to punish the treachery of Philip of Macedon 
(xv. 4); and the greatest of them, Scipio himself, Polybius regards 
as the especial favourite of fortune (xxxii. 15; x.5). 

In respect of form, Polybius is far the inferior of Livy, partly 
owing to his very virtues. His laudable desire to present a picture 
of the whole political situation at each important moment is fatal 
to the continuity of his narrative. Thus the thrilling story of the 
Second Punic War is broken in upon by digressions on the con- 
temporary affairs in Greece and Asia. More serious, however, 
than this excessive love of synchronism is his almost pedantic 
anxiety to edify. For grace and elegance of composition, and for 
the artistic presentation of events, he has a hardly concealed con- 
tempt. Hence a general and almost studied carelessness of effect, 
which mars his whole work. On the other hand he is never weary 
of preaching. His favourite theories of the nature and aims^ of 
history, of the distinction between the universal and special histories, 
of the duties of an historian, sound as most of them are in them- 
selves, are enforced with wearisome iteration; more than once the 
effect of a graphic picture is spoilt by obtrusive moralizing. Nor, 
lastly, is Polybius's style itself such as to compensate for these 
defects. It is, indeed, often impressive from the evident earnest- 
ness of the writer, and from his sense of the gravity of his subject, 
and is unspoilt by rhetoric or conceit. It has about it the ring of 
reality; the language is sometimes pithy and vigorous; and now 
and then we meet with apt metaphors, such as those borrowed 
from boxing (i. 57). from cock-fighting (i. 58), from draughts (i. 84). 
But, in spite of these redeeming features, the prevailing baldness 
of Polybius's style excludes him from the first rank among classical 
writers; and it is impossible to quarrel with the verdict pronounced 
by Dionysius of Hahcarnassus, who places him among those authors 
of later times who neglected the graces of style, and who paid for 
their neglect by leaving behind them works " which no one was 
patient enough to read through to the end." 

It is to the value and variety of his matter, to his critical insight, 
breadth of view and wide research, and not least to the surpassing 
importance and interest of the period with which he deals, that 
Polybius owes his place among the writers of history. What is 
known as to the fortunes of his histories, and the reputation they 
enjoyed, fully bears out this conclusion. The silence respecting

iter of style. On the other hand, Cicero (De off. iii. 32 ] 

describes him as "bonus auctor in primis"; in the De republica 



(ii. 14) he praises highly his accuracy in matters of chronology; 
and Cicero's younger contemporary, Marcus Brutus, was a devoted 
student of Polybius, t and was engaged on the eve of the battle of 
Pharsalia in compiling an epitome of his histories (Su'idas, s.v.; 
Plutarch, Brut. 4). t Livy, however, notwithstanding the extent 
to which he used his writings (see Livy), speaks of him in such 
qualified terms as to suggest the idea that his strong artistic sensi- 
bilities had been wounded by Polybius's literary defects. He has 
nothing better to say of him than that he is 4 by no means con- 
temptible" (xxx. 45), and "not an untrustworthy author" (xxxiii. 
10). Posidonius and Strabo, both of them Stoics like Polybius 
himself, are said to have written continuations of his history (Su'idas, 
s.v.; Strabo p. 515). Arrian in the early part of the 2nd and 
Aelian in the 3rd century both speak of him with respect, though 
with reference mainly to his excellence as an authority on the art 
of war. In addition to his Histories Polybius was the author of 
the following smaller works: a life of Philopocmcn (Polyb. x. 24), 
a history of the Numantine War (Cic. Ad Fam. v. 12), a treatise on 
tactics (Polyb. ix. 20; Arrian, Tactica; Aelian, Tact. i.). The 
geographical treatise, referred to by Geminus, is possibly identical 
with the thirty-fourth book of the Histories (Schweighauser, 
PraeJ. p. 184. 

"Authorities. — The complete books (i.-v.) of the Histories 
were first printed in a Latin translation by Nicholas Perotti in 
1473. The date of the first Greek edition, that by Obsopaeus, 
is 1530. For a full account of these and of later editions, as well 
as of the extant MSS., see Schweighauscr's Preface to his edition 
of Polybius. Our knowledge of the contents of the fragmentary 
books is derived partly from quotations in ancient writers, but 
mainly from two collections of excerpts; one, probably the work 
of a late Byzantine compiler, was first printed at Basel in 1549 
and contains extracts from books^ vi.-xviii. (irepl irpevfitlwy irtpl 
aperrjs kclI kclkLcls) ; the other consists of two fragments from the 
41 select passages " from Greek historians compiled by the directions 
of Constantine Porphyrogenitus in the 10th century. To these 
must be added the Vatican excerpts edited by Angelo Mai in the 
present century.

POLYCARP (c. 60-c. 155), bishop of Smyrna and one of the 
Apostolic Fathers, derives much of his importance from the fact 
that he links together the apostolic age and that of nascent 
Catholicism. The sources from which we derive our knowledge 
of the life and activity of Polycarp are: (1) a few notices in the 
writings of Irenaeus, (2) the Epistle of Polycarp to the Church at 
Philippi, (3) the Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp, (4) the Epistle 
of the Church at Smyrna to the Church at Philomelium, giving 
an account of the martyrdom of Polycarp. Since these authori- 
ties have all been more or less called in question and some of them 
entirely rejected by recent criticism, it is necessary to say a few 
words about each. 

1 . The Statements of Irenaeus are found (a) in his Adversus haereses, 
iii. 3, 4, (b) in the letter to Victor, where Irenaeus gives an account 
of Polycarp's visit to Rome, (c) in the letter to Florinus — a most 
important document which describes the intercourse between 
Irenaeus and Polycarp and Polycarp's relation with St John. No 
objection has been made against the genuineness of the statements 
in the Adversus haereses, but the authenticity of the two letters 
has been stoutly contested in recent times by van Manen. 1 The 
main attack is directed against the Epistle to Florinus, doubtless 
because of its importance. " The manifest exaggerations," says 
van Manen, " coupled with the fact that Irenaeus never shows 
any signs of acquaintance with Florinus . . . enable us to perceive 
clearly that a writer otherwise unknown is speaking to us here." 
The criticism of van Manen has, however, found no supporters 
outside the Dutch school. The epistle is quoted by Eusebius 

1 Ency. Bib. Hi. 3490. 



(v. 20), and is accepted as genuine by Harnack 2 and Kriiger.* 
The relevant statements in the letter, moreover, are supported 
by the references to Polycarp which we find in the body of 
Irenaeus's great work. 

2. 'The Epistle of Polycarp. — Though Irenaeus states that Polycarp 
wrote many " letters to the neighbouring churches or to certain 
of the brethren "* only one has been preserved, viz. the well-known 
letter to the Philippians. The epistle is largely involved in the 
Ignatian controversy (see Ignatius). The testimony which it 
affords to the Ignatian Epistles is so striking that those scholars 
who regard these letters as spurious are bound to reject the Epistle 
of Polycarp altogether, or at any rate to look upon it as largely 
interpolated. The former course has been adopted by Schwcgler, 5 
Zeller, 6 and Hilgenfeld, 7 the latter by Ritschl 8 and Lipsius. 9 The 
rehabilitation of the Ignatian letters in modern times has, however, 
practically destroyed the attack on the Epistles of Polycarp. The 
external evidence in its favour is of considerable weight. Irenaeus 
(iii. 3, 4) expressly mentions and commends a " very adequate " 
(kavcorAnj) letter of Polycarp to the Philippians, and we have no 
reason for doubting the identity of this letter mentioned by Irenaeus 
with our epistle. Eusebius (iii. 36) quotes extracts from the 
epistle, and some of the extracts contain the very passages which 
the critics have marked as interpolations, and Jerome (De Vir. III. 
xvii.) testifies that in his time the epistle was publicly read in the 
Asiatic churches. The internal evidence is equally strong. There 
is absolutely no motive for a forgery in the contents of the epistle. 
As Harnack says, " There is no trace of any tendency beyond the 
immediate purpose of maintaining the true Christian life in the 
church and warning it against covetousness and against an un- 
brotherly spirit. The occasion of the letter was a case of embezzle- 
ment, the guilty individual being a presbyter at Philippi. It shows 
a fine combination of mildness with seventy; the language is simple 
but powerful, and, while there is undoubtedly a lack of original 
ideas, the author shows remarkable skill in weaving together 
pregnant sentences and impressive warnings selected from the 
apostolic epistles and the first Epistle of Clement. In these circum- 
stances it would never have occurred to any one to doubt the 
genuineness of the epistle or to suppose that it had been inter- 
polated, but for the fact that in several passages reference is made 
to Ignatius and his epistles." The date of the epistle depends 
upon the date of the Ignatian lettera and is now 'generally fixed 
between 112 and 118. An attempt has been made in some quarters 
to prove that certain allusions in the epistle imply the rise of the 
heresy of Marcion and that it cannot therefore be placed earlier than 
140. Lightfoot, however, has proved that Polycarp's statements 
may equally well be directed against Corinthianism or any other 
form of Docetism, while some of his arguments are absolutely 
inapplicable to Marcionism, 

3. The Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp. — This epistle has of course 
been subjected to the same criticism as has been directed against 
the other epistles of Ignatius (see Ignatius). Over and above the 
general criticism, which may now be said to have been completely 
answered by the investigations of Zahn, Lightfoot and Harnack, 
one or two special arguments have been brought against the Epistle 
to Polycarp. Ussher, for instance, while accepting the other six 
epistles, rejected this on the ground that Jerome says that Ignatius 
only sent one letter to Smyrna — a mistake due to his misinterpre- 
tation of Eusebius. Some modern scholars (among whom Harnack 
was formerly numbered, though he has modified his views on the 
point) feel a difficulty about the peremptory tone which Ignatius 
adopts towards Polycarp. There was some force in this argument 
when the Ignatian Epistles were dated about 140, as in that case 
Polycarp would have been an old and venerable man at the time. 
But now that the date is put back to about 112 the difficulty 
vanishes, since Polycarp was not much over forty when he received 
the letter. We must remember, too, that Ignatius was writing 
under the consciousness of impending martyrdom and evidently 
felt that this gave him the right to criticize the bishops and churches 
of Asia. 

4. The Letter of the Church at Smyrna to the Philomelians is a 
most important document, because we derive from it all our in- 
formation with regard to Polycarp's martyrdom. Eusebius has 
preserved the greater part of this epistle (iv. 15), but we possess it 
entire with various concluding observations in several Greek MSS., 
and also in a Latin translation. The epistle gives a minute 
description of the persecution in Smyrna, of the last days of 
Polycarp and of his trial and martyrdom ; and as it contains many 
instructive details and professes to have been written not long after 
the events to which it refers, it has always been regarded as one 
ofthe most precious remains of the 2nd century. Certain recent 
critics, however, have questioned the authenticity of the narrative.

Lipsius brings 1 the date of the epistle down to about 260, though 
he admits many of the statements as trustworthy. Kcim, too, 8 
endeavours to show that, although it was based on good information, 
it could not have been composed till the middle of the 3rd century. 
A similar position has also been taken up by Schurer, 1 Holtzmann,« 
Gebhardt,* ReVille, 8 and van Manen. 7 The last named regards the 
document " as a decorated narrative of the saint s martyrdom 
framed after the pattern of Jesus' martyrdom, though he thinks 
that it cannot be put as late as 250, but must fall within the limits 
of the 2nd century. It cannot be said, however, that the case 
against the document has been at all substantiated, and the more 
moderate school of modern critics (e.g. Lightfoot/ Harnack,' 
KrOger) 10 is unanimous in regarding it as an authentic document, 
though it recognizes that here and there a few slight interpolations 
have been inserted. 11 Besides these we have no other sources for 
the life of Polycarp; the Vita S. Polycarpi auctore Pionio (published 
by Duchesne, Paris, 1881, and Lightfoot Ignatius and Polycarp, 
1885, ii. 101 5-1047), is worthless. 

Assuming the genuineness of the documents mentioned, we 
now proceed to collect the scanty information which they afford 
with regard to Polycarp's career. Very little is known about 
his early life. He must have been born not later than the year 
69, for on the day of his death (c. 155) he declared that he had 
served the Lord for eighty-six years (Martyrium, 9). The 
statement seems to imply that he was of Christian parentage; 
he cannot have heen older than eighty-six at the time of his 
martyrdom, since he had paid a visit to Rome almost immediately 
before. Irenaeus tells us that in early life Polycarp " had been 
taught by apostles and lived in familiar intercourse with many 
that had seen Christ " (iii. 3,4)- This testimony is expanded 
in the remarkable words which Irenaeus addresses to Florinus: 
" I saw thee when I was still a boy (reus tn &v) in Lower Asia 
in company with Polycarp ... I can even now point out the 
place where the blessed Polycarp used to sit when he discoursed, 
and describe his goings out and his comings in, his manner of 
life and his personal appearance and the discourses which he 
delivered to the people, how he used to speak of his intercourse 
with John and with the rest of those who had seen the Lord, and 
how he would relate their words. And everything that he had 
heard from them about the Lord, about His miracles and about 
His teaching, Polycarp used to tell us as one who had received 
it from those who had seen the Word of Life with their own eyes, 
and all this in perfect harmony with the Scriptures. To these 
things I used to listen at the time, through the mercy of God 
vouchsafed to me, noting them down, not on paper but in my 
heart, and constantly by the grace of God I brood over my 
accurate recollections." These are priceless words, for they 
establish a chain of tradition (John-Polycarp-Irenaeus) which is 
without a parallel in early church history. Polycarp thus 
becomes the living link between the Apostolic age and the great 
writers who flourished at the end of the 2nd century. Recent 
criticism, however, has endeavoured to destroy the force of the 
words of Irenaeus. Harnack, for instance, attacks this link at 
both ends. 12 (a) The connexion of Irenaeus and Polycarp, he 
argues, is very weak, because Irenaeus was only a boy (7rats) at 
the time, and his recollections therefore carry very little weight. 
The fact too that he never shows any signs of having been influ- 
enced by Polycarp and never once quotes his writings is a further 
proof that the relation between them was slight, (b) The 
connexion which Irenaeus tries to establish between Polycarp 
and John the apostle is probably due to a blunder. Irenaeus has 
confused John the apostle and John the presbyter. Polycarp 
was the disciple of the latter, not the former. In this second

" Chronologic i- 325-329- 



argument Harnack has the support of a considerable number of 
modern scholars who deny the Ephesian residence of John the 
apostle. But, as Gwatkin 13 has pointed out, Harnack's argu- 
ments are by no means decisive, (a) When Irenaeus describes 
himself as a boy (ttcus), he need not have meant a very young lad, 
under thirteen, as Harnack makes out. Lightfoot has cited many 
instances which prove that the word could be used of a man 
of thirty. 14 Nor does the alternative phrase which Irenaeus uses 
in iii. 3, 4 ( op kclI ^juels iupatcanep kv r$ rrpcoTV rjfjubv rjhjclq) 
militate against this interpretation, for elsewhere Irenaeus him- 
self distinctly says " triginta annorum.actas prima indoles est 
juvenis " (ii. 22, 5). It is true that Harnack has adduced argu- 
ments which cannot be discussed here to prove that Irenaeus 
was not born till about 140; 15 but against this we may quote the 
decision of Lipsius, who puts the date of his birth at 130, 16 while 
Lightfoot argues for 120. 17 The fact that Irenaeus never quotes 
Polycarp does not count for much. Polycarp wrote very little. 
He does not seem to have been a man of great mental capacity. 
" His influence was that of saintliness rather than that of 
intellect." (b) A discussion of Harnack's second line of argument 
is impossible here. His theory with regard to the confusion 
of names is a gratuitous assumption and cannot be proved. 
The tradition of St John's residence at Ephesus is too strong to 
be easily set aside. In spite therefore of much modern criticism 
there seems to be no solid reason for rejecting the statements of 
Irenaeus and regarding Polycarp as the link between the Apostolic 
age and the first of the Catholic fathers. 

Though Polycarp must have been bishop of Smyrna for nearly 
half a century we know next to nothing about his career. We 
get only an occasional glimpse of his activity, and the period 
between 115 and 155 is practically a blank. The only points of 
sure information which we possess relate to (1) his relations with 
Ignatius, (2) his protests against heresy, (3) his visit to Rome in 
the time of Anicetus, (4) his martyrdom. 

1 . His Relations with Ignatius. — Ignatius, while on his way to 
Rome to suffer martyrdom, halted at Smyrna and received a 
warm welcome from the church and its bishop. Upon reaching 
Troas he despatched two letters, one to the church at Smyrna, 
another addressed personally to Polycarp. In these letters 
Ignatius charged Polycarp to write to all the churches between 
Smyrna and Syria (since his hurried departure from Troas made 
it impossible for him to do so in # person) urging them to send 
letters and delegates to the church at Antioch to congratulate 
it upon the cessation of the persecution and to establish it in the 
faith. The letters of Ignatius illustrate the commanding 
position which Polycarp had already attained in Asia. It was 
in the discharge of the task which had been laid upon him by 
Ignatius that Polycarp was brought into correspondence with 
the Philippians. The Church at Philippi wrote to Polycarp 
asking him to forward their letters to Antioch. Polycarp replied, 
promising to carry out their request and enclosing a number of 
the letters of Ignatius which he had in his possession. 

2. Polycarp's Attack on Heresy.— AW through his life Polycarp 
appears to have been an uncompromising opponent of heresy. 
We find him in his epistle (ch. vii.) uttering a strong protest 
against certain false teachers (probably the followers of 
Ccrinthus). 

For every one who shall not confess that Jesus Christ is come 
in the flesh is antichrist; and whosoever shall not confess the 
testimony of the Cross is of the devil; and whosoever shall pervert 
the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts and say that there is neither 
resurrection nor judgment, that man is the first-born of Satan. 
Wherefore let us forsake their vain doing and their false teaching 
and turn unto the word which was delivered unto us from the 
beginning." 

Polycarp lived to see the rise of the Marcionite and Valentinian 
sects and vigorously opposed them. Irenaeus tells us that on 

" Contemp. Review, February 1897. 

14 Ignatius and Polycarp, i. 432, for instance, Constantine (Euseb. 
V.C.ii. 51) describes himself as koh&S *" a **» though he must have

POLYCLITUS 



one occasion Marcion endeavoured to establish relations with 
him and accosted him with the words, " Recognize us." But 
Polycarp displayed the same uncompromising attitude which his 
master John had shown towards Cerinthus and answered, " I 
recognize you as the first-born of Satan." The steady progress 
of the heretical movement in spite of all opposition was a cause 
of deep sorrow to Polycarp, so that in the last years of his life the 
words were constantly on his lips, " Oh good God, to what times 
hast thou spared me, that I must suffer such things!" 

3. Polycarp' s Visit to Rome. — It is one of the most interesting 
and important events in the church history of the 2nd century 
that Polycarp, shortly before his death, when he was considerably 
over eighty years old, undertook a journey to Rome in order to 
visit the bishop Anicetus. Irenaeus, to whom we are indebted 
for this information (Haer. iii. 3, 4; Epist. ad victorem, ap. 
Euseb. v. 24), gives as the reason for the journey the fact that 
differences existed between Asia and Rome " with regard to 
certain things " and especially about the time of the Easter 
festival. He might easily have told us what these " certain 
things " were and given us fuller details of the negotiations 
between the two great bishops, for in all probability he was 
himself in Rome at the time. But unfortunately all he says is 
that with regard to the certain things the two bishops speedily 
came to an understanding, while as to the time of Easter, each 
adhered to his own custom, without breaking off communion 
with the other. We learn further that Anicetus as a mark of 
special honour allowed Polycarp to celebrate the Eucharist in 
the church, and that many Marcionites and Valentinians were 
converted by him during his stay in Rome. 

4. Polycarp's Martyrdom. — Not many months apparently 
after Polycarp's return from Rome a persecution broke out in 
Asia. A great festival was in progress at Smyrna. The pro- 
consul Statius Quadratus was present on the occasion, and the 
asiarch Philip of Tralles was presiding over the games. Eleven 
Christians had been brought, mostly from Philadelphia, to be 
put to death. The appetite of the populace was inflamed by the 
spectacle of their martyrdom. A cry was raised " Away with 
the atheists. Let search be made for Polycarp." Polycarp took 
refuge in a country farm. His hiding-place, however, was be- 
trayed and he was arrested and brought back into the city. 
Attempts were made by the officials to induce him to recant, but 
without effect. When he came into the theatre the proconsul 
urged him to " revile Christ,"* and promised, if he would consent 
to abjure his faith, that he would set him at liberty. To this 
appeal Polycarp made the memorable answer, " Eighty and six 
years have I served Him and He hath done me no wrong. How 
then can I speak evil of my King who saved me? " These words 
only intensified the fury of the mob. They clamoured for a lion 
to be let loose upon him there and then. The asiarch however 
refused, urging as an excuse that the games were over. When 
they next demanded that their victim should be burned, the 
proconsul did not interfere. Timber and faggots were hastily 
collected and Polycarp was placed upon the pyre. With calm 
dignity and unflinching courage he met his fate and crowned a 
noble life with an heroic death. 

The question as to the date of the martyrdom has evoked 
considerable controversy. Eusebius in his Chronicon gives 
a.d. 166 as the date of Poly carp's death, and until the year 1867 
this statement was never questioned. In that year appeared 
Waddington's Mimoire sur la chronologie de la vie du rhiteur 
Aelius Arislide y in which it was shown from a most acute combin- 
ation of circumstances that the Quadratus whose name is men- 
tioned in the Martyrium was proconsul of Asia in 155-156, and 
that consequently Polycarp was martyred on the 23rd of February 
155- Waddington's conclusion has received overwhelming 
support amongst recent critics. His views have been accepted 
by (amongst many others) Renan, 1 Hilgenfeld, 2 Gebhardt, 3 
Lipsius, 4 Harnack, 5 Zahn, 6 Lightfoot, 7 Randell. 8 Against this

array of scholars only the following names of importance can be 
quoted in support of the traditional view — Keim, 9 Wieseler 10 and 
IJhlhorn. 11 The problem is too complex to admit of treatment 
here. There seems to be little doubt that the case for the earlier 
date has been proved. The only point upon which there is 
division of opinion is as to whether Waddington's date 155, or — 
as is suggested by Lipsius and supported by C.H. Turner 12 — the 
following year 156 is the more probable. The balance of opinion 
seems to favour the latter alternative, because it leaves more 
room for Polycarp 's visit to Anicetus, who only became bishop of 
Rome in 154. Harnack, however, after careful investigation, 
prefers 155. 

The significance of Polycarp in the history of the Church is 
out of all proportion to our knowledge of the facts of his career. 
The violent attack of the Smyrnaean mob is an eloquent tribute 
to his influence in Asia. " This is the teacher of Asia," they 
shouted, "this is the father of the Christians: this is the des- 
troyer of our gods: this is the man who has taught so many no 
longer to sacrifice and no longer to pray to the gods." 13 And 
after the execution they refused to deliver up his bones to the 
Christians for burial on the ground that " the Christians would 
now forsake the Crucified and worship Polycarp." 14 Polycarp 
was indeed, as Polycrates says, 15 " one of the great luminaries " 
(jieycika aroixtia) of the time. It was in no small degree due to 
his stanch and unwavering leadership that the Church was saved 
from the peril of being overwhelmed by the rising tide of the 
pagan revival which swept over Asia during the first half of the 
2nd century, and it was his unfaltering allegiance to the Apostolic 
faith that secured the defeat of the many forms of heresy which 
threatened to destroy the Church from within. Polycarp had 
no creative genius. He was a " transmitter, not a maker," 
but herein lies his greatness. Much occurred between the 
Apostolic age and the age when the faith of the Church was 
fixed in the earliest creed and protected by the determination 
of the canon of the New Testament. This intervening period 
was the most perilous epoch in the history of the ante-Nicene 
Church. The Apostolic tradition might have been perverted 
and corrupted. The purity of the Gospel might have been 
defiled. The Christian ideal might have been lost. That the 
danger was so largely averted is to no small extent the result of 
the faithful witness of Polycarp. As Irenaeus says (iii. 3, 4), 
" Polycarp does not appear to have possessed qualifications for 
successfully conducting a controversial discussion with erroneous 
teachers . . . but he could not help feeling how unlike their 
speculations were to the doctrines which he had learned from 
the Apostles, and so he met with indignant reprobation their 
attempt to supersede Christ's gospel with fictions of their own 
devising." It is this that constitutes Polycarp's service to the 
Church, and no greater service has been rendered by any of its 
leaders in any age.

POLYCLITUS, the name of two Greek sculptors of the school 
of Argos; the first belonging to the fifth century, the second to 
the early part of the fourth. 

1. The elder and best known Polyclitus was a contemporary of 
Pheidias, and in the opinion of the Greeks his equal. He made 
a figure of an Amazon for Ephesus which was regarded as superior 
to the Amazon of Pheidias made at the same time; and his 
colossal Hera of gold and ivory which stood in the temple near 
Argos was considered as worthy to rank with the Zeus of Pheidias.

POLYCRATES— POLYGAMY 



23 



It would be hard for a modern critic to rate Polyclitus so high: 
the reason is that balance, rhythm and the minute perfection of 
bodily form, which were the great merits of this sculptor, do not 
appeal to us as they did to the Greeks of the 5th century. He 
worked mainly in bronze. 

As regards his chronology we have data in a papyrus pub- 
lished by Grenfell and Hunt containing lists of athletic victors. 
From this it appears that he made a statue of Cyniscus, a victori- 
ous athlete of 464 or 460 B.C., of Pythocles (452) and Aristion 
(452). He thus can scarcely have been born as late as 480 B.C. 
His statue of Hera is dated by Pliny to 420 B.C. His artistic 
activity must thus have been long and prolific. 

Copies of his spearman (doryphorus) (see Greek Art, Plate VI. 
fig. 80), and his victor winding a ribbon round his head (diadu- 
menus) have long been recognized in our galleries. We see their 
excellence, but they inspire no enthusiasm, because they are 
more fleshy than modern figures of athletes, and want charm. 
They are chiefly valuable as showing us the square forms of body 
affected by Polyclitus, and the scheme he adopted, throwing 
the weight of the body (as Pliny says of him) on one leg. We 
must not, however, judge of a great Greek sculptor by Roman 
copies of his works. This has been enforced by the discovery at 
Delos, hy the French excavators, of a diadumenus of far more 
pleasing type and greater finish, which also goes back to Poly- 
clitus. The excavations at 01ympia x *have also greatly widened 
our knowledge of the sculptor. Among the bases of statues 
found on that site were three signed by Polyclitus, still bearing 
on their surface the marks of attachment of the feet of the 
statues. This at once gives us their pose; and following up the 
clue, A. Furtwangler has identified several extant statues as 
copies of figures of boy athletes victorious at Olympia set up by 
Polyclitus. Among these the Westmacott athlete in the British 
Museum is conspicuous. And it is certain that these boys, 
although the anatomy of their bodies seems to be too mature, yet 
have a real charm, combining beauty of form with modesty and 
unaffected simplicity. They enable us better to understand the 
merit of the sculptor. 

The Amazon of Polyclitus survives in several copies, among 
the best of which is one in the British Museum (for its type see 
Greek Art, fig. 40). Here again we find a certain heaviness; 
and the womanly character of the Amazon scarcely appears 
through her robust limbs. But the Amazon of Pheidias, if 
rightly identified, is no better. The masterpiece of Polyclitus, 
his Hera of gold and ivory, has of course totally clisappeared. 
The coins of Argos give us only the general type. Many archaeo- 
logists have tried to find a copy of the head. The most defen- 
sible of all these identifications is that of C. Waldstein, who 
shows that a head of a girl in the British Museum (labelled as 
Polyclitan) corresponds so nearly with that of Hera on 5th 
century coins of Argos that we must regard it as a reflex of the 
head of the great statue. It seems very hard and cold beside 
such noble heads of the goddess as those in the Ludovisi Gallery 
(Terme Museum) Rome. American archaeologists have in 
recent years conducted excavations on the site of the Argive 
temple of Hera (Argos and Greek Art, fig. 39) ; but the sculp- 
tural fragments, heads and torsos, which seem to belong to the 
temple erected in the time of Polyclitus, have no close stylistic 
resemblance to other statues recognized as his; and at present 
their position in the history of art is matter of dispute. 

The want of variety in the works of Polyclitus was brought as 
a reproach against him by ancient critics. Varro says triat his 
statues were square and almost of one pattern. We have 
already observed that there was small variety in their attitudes. 
Except for the statue of Hera, which was the work of his old 
age, he produced scarcely any notable statue of a deity. His 
field was narrowly limited; but in that field he was unsurpassed. 

2. The younger Polyclitus was of the same family as the elder, 
and the works of the two are not easily to be distinguished. 
Some existing bases, however, bearing the name are inscribed 
in characters of the 4th century, at which time the elder sculptor 
cannot have been alive. The most noted work of the younger 
artist was a statue in marble of Zeus Milichius (the Merciful) 



set up by the people of Argos after a shameful massacre which 
took place in 370 B.C. The elder artist is not known to have 
worked in marble. (P. G.) 

POLYCRATES, tyrant of Samos (c. 535-515 B.C.). Having 
won popularity by donations to poorer citizens, he took advan- 
tage of a festival of Hera, which was being celebrated outside 
the walls, to make himself master of the city (about 535 B.C.). 
After getting rid of his brothers Pantagnotus and Syloson, who 
had at first shared his power, he established a despotism which 
is of great importance in the history of the island. Realizing 
clearly the value of sea-power for a Greek state, he equipped 
a fleet of 100 ships, and so became master of the Aegean basin. 
This ascendancy he abused by numerous acts of piracy which 
made him notorious throughout Greece; but his real purpose 
in building his navy was to become lord of all the islands of the 
archipelago and the mainland towns of Ionia. The details 
of his conquests are uncertain, but it is known that in the 
Cyclades he maintained an alliance with the tyrant Lygdamis 
of Naxos, and curried favour with the Delian Apollo by dedi- 
cating to him the island of Rheneia. He also encountered and 
heavily defeated a coalition of two great naval powers of the 
Asiatic coast, Miletus and Lesbos. Doubtless with the object 
of expanding the flourishing foreign trade of Samos, he entered 
into alliance with Amasis, king of Egypt, who, according to 
Herodotus, renounced his ally because he feared that the gods, 
in envy of Polycrates' excessive good fortune, would bring 
ruin upon him and his allies. It is more probable that the 
breach of the compact was due to Polycrates, for when Cambyses 
of Persia invaded Egypt (525) the Samian tyrant offered to 
support him with a naval contingent. This squadron never 
reached Egypt, for the crews, composed as they were of Poly- 
crates' political enemies, suspecting that Cambyses was under 
agreement to slay them, put back to Samos and attacked their 
master. After a defeat by sea, Polycrates repelled an assault 
upon the walls, and subsequently withstood a siege by a joint 
armament of Spartans and Corinthians assembled to aid the 
rebels. He maintained his ascendancy until about 515, when 
Oroetes, the Persian governor of Lydia, who had been reproached 
for his failure to reduce Samos by force, lured him to the 
mainland by false promises of gain and put him to death by 
crucifixion. 

Beside the political and commercial pre-eminence which he 
conferred upon Samos, Polycrates adorned the city with public 
works on a large scale — an aqueduct, a mole and a temple of 
Hera (see Samos; Aqueducts). The splendour of his palace 
is attested by the proposal of the Roman emperor Caligula to 
rebuild it. Foreign artists worked for him at high wages; 
from Athens he brought Democedes, the greatest physician of 
the age, at an exceptional salary. He was also a patron of 
letters: he collected a library and lived on terms of intimate 
friendship with the poet Anacreon, whose verses were full of 
references to his patron. The philosopher Pythagoras, however, 
quitted Samos in order to escape his tyranny. (M. O. B. C.) 

POLYCRATES, Athenian sophist and rhetorician, flourished 
in the 4th century B.C. He taught at Athens, and afterwards 
in Cyprus. He composed declamations on paradoxical themes 
— an Encomium on Clytaemnestra, an Accusation of Socrates, 
an Encomium on Busiris (a mythical king of Egypt, notorious 
for his inhumanity); also declamations on mice, pots and 
counters. His Encomium on Busiris was sharply criticized 
by Isocrates, in a work still extant, and Dionysius of Hali- 
carnassus characterizes his style as frigid, vulgar and inelegant. 

POLYGAMY (Gr. to\vs, many, and y&nos, marriage), or as it 
is sometimes termed, Polygyny (yvvrj, woman), the system 
under which a man is married to several women at the same time. 
Derivatively it includes the practice of polyandry, but it has 
become definitely restricted to expressing what has been, and still 
is, far the commonest type of relations between the sexes (see 
Family and Marriage). Among Oriental nations plurality of 
legal wives is customary. Mahommedans are allowed four. A 
Hindu can have as many as he pleases: the high-caste sometimes 
having as many as a hundred. Polygamy is the rule among

African tribes, and is common among those of Australia and Poly- 
nesia. In China, however, only one wife is lawful. In many 
polygamous countries the practical obstacle of expense prevents 
men from taking advantage of their privileges. While poly- 
gamy was the rule in biblical days among the ancient Jews, and 
was permitted and even enjoined in certain cases by the Mosaic 
law, the Christian Church, though it is nowhere forbidden, except 
for " bishops," in the New Testament, has always set its face 
against it. There have, however, been divines who dissented 
from this general disapproval. The Anabaptists insisted on 
freedom in the matter, and Bernardino Ochino conditionally 
defended plurality of wives. When in 1540 Philip the Magnani- 
mous, the reforming Landgrave of Hesse, determined (with his 
wife's approval, she being a confirmed invalid) to marry a second 
wife, Luther and Melanchthon approved "as his personal friends, 
though not as doctors of theology"; while Martin Bucer assisted 
at the marriage. In later times the Mormons (g.v.) in America 
provide the most notable instance of the revival of polygamy. 

POLYGENISTS, the term applied to those anthropologists 
who contend that the several primary races of mankind are 
separate species of independent origin. (See Monogenists.) 

POLYGLOTT (Gr. irokvs, many, and YX&rra, tongue), the term 
for a book which contains side by side versions of the same text 
in several different languages; the most important polyglotts 
are editions of the Bible, or its parts, in which the Hebrew and 
Greek originals are exhibited along with the great historical 
versions, which are of value for the history of the text and its 
interpretation. The first enterprise of this kind is the famous 
Hexapla of Origen in which the Old Testament Scriptures were 
written in six parallel columns, the first containing the Hebrew 
text, the second a transliteration of this in Greek letters, the 
third and fourth the Greek translations by Aquila and Sym- 
machus, the fifth the Septuagint version as revised by Origen, 
the sixth the translation by Theodotion. Inasmuch, however, as 
only two languages, Hebrew and Greek, were employed the work 
was rather diglott than polyglott in the usual sense. After the 
invention of printing and the revival of philological studies, 
polyglotts became a favourite means of advancing the knowledge 
of Eastern languages (for which no good helps were available) as 
well as the study of Scripture. The series began with the 
Comphitensian printed by Arnaldus Guilielmus de Brocario at 
the expense of Cardinal Ximenes at the university at Alcala de 
Henares (Complutum). The first volume of this, containing the 
New Testament in Greek and Latin, was completed on the 10th 
of January 1514. In vols, ii.-v. (finished on July io, 151 7) 
the Hebrew text of the Old Testament was printed in the 
first column of each page, followed by the Latin Vulgate and 
then by the Septuagint version with an interlinear Latin trans- 
lation. Below these stood the Chaldee, again with a Latin 
translation. The sixth volume containing an appendix is dated 
1515, but the work did not receive the papal sanction till March 
1520, and was apparently not issued till 1522. The chief editors 
were Juan de Vergara, Lopez de Zuniga (Stunica), Nunez de 
Guzman (Pincianus), Antonio de Librixa (Nebrissensis), and 
Demetrius Ducas. About half a century after the Complu- 
tensian came the Antwerp Polyglott, printed by Christopher 
Plantin (1560-1572, in 8 vols, folio). Of this the principal editor 
was Arias Montanus aided by Guido Fabricius Boderianus, 
Raphelengius, Masius, Lucas of Bruges and others. This work 
was under the patronage of Philip II. of Spain; it added a new 
language to those of the Comphitensian by including the Syriac 
New Testament; and, while the earlier polyglott had only the 
Targum of Onkelos on the Pentateuch, the Antwerp Bible had 
also the Targum on the Prophets, and on Esther, Job, Psalms 
and the Salomonic writings. Next came Le Jay's Paris Poly- 
glott (1645), which embraces the first printed texts of the Syriac 
Old Testament (edited by Gabriel Sionita, a Maronite, but the 
book of Ruth by Abraham Ecchelensis, also a Maronite) and of 
the Samaritan Pentateuch and version (by Morinus). It has also 
an Arabic version, or rather a series of various Arabic versions. 
The last great polyglott is Brian Walton's (London, 1657), 
which is much less beautiful than Le Jay's but more complete 



in various ways, including, among other things, the Syriac of 
Esther and of several apocryphal books for which it is wanting 
in the Paris Bible, Persian versions of the Pentateuch and Gospels, 
and the Psalms and New Testament in Ethiopic. Walton was 
aided by able scholars, and used much new manuscript material. 
His prolegomena, too, and collections of various readings mark an 
important advance in biblical criticism. It was in connexion 
with this polyglott that E. Castell produced his famous Heptaglott 
Lexicon (2 vols, folio, London, 1669), an astounding monument of 
industry and erudition even when allowance is made for the fact 
that for the Arabic he had the great MS. lexicon compiled and 
left to the university of Cambridge by the almost forgotten 
W. Bed well. The liberality of Cardinal Ximenes, who is said 
to have spent half a million ducats on it, removed the Complu- 
tensian polyglott from the risks of commerce. The other three 
editions all brought their promoters to the verge of ruin. The 
later polyglotts are of little scientific importance, the best 
recent texts having been confined to a single language; but every 
biblical student still uses Walton and, if he can get it, Le Jay. 
Of the numerous polyglott editions of parts of the Bible it may 
suffice to mention the Genoa psalter of 151 6, edited by Giustini- 
ani, bishop of Nebbio. This is in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Chaldee 
and Arabic, and is interesting from the character of the Chaldee 
text, being the first specimen of Western printing in the Arabic 
character, and from a curious note on Columbus and the dis- 
covery of America on the margin of Psalm xix. (A. W. Po.) 

POLYGNOTUS, Greek painter in the middle of the 5th century 
B.C., son of Aglaophon, was a native of Thasos, but was adopted 
by the Athenians, and admitted to their citizenship. He painted 
for them in the time of Cimon a picture of the taking of Ilium 
on the walls of the Stoa Poecile, and another of the marriage of 
the daughters of Leucippus in the Anaceum. In the hall at the 
entrance to the Acropolis other works of his were preserved. 
The most important, however, of his paintings were his frescoes 
in a building erected at Delphi by the people of Cnidus. The 
subjects of these were the visit to Hades by Odysseus, and the 
taking of Ilium. Fortunately the traveller Pausanias has left 
us a careful description of these paintings, figure by figure 
(Paus. x. 25-31). The foundations of the building have been 
recovered in the course of the French excavations at Delphi. 
From this evidence, some modern archaeologists have tried to 
reconstruct the paintings, excepting of course the colours of them. 
The best of these reconstructions is by Carl Robert, who by the 
help of vase-paintings of the middle of the fifth century has 
succeeded in recovering both the perspective of Polygnotus 
and the character of his figures (see Greek Art, fig. 29). The 
figures were detached and seldom overlapping, ranged in two or 
three rows one above another; and the farther were not smaller 
nor dimmer than the nearer. The designs are repeated in 
Frazer's Pausanias, v. 360 and 372. It will hence appear 
that paintings at this time were executed on almost precisely 
the same plan as contemporary sculptural reliefs. We 
learn also that Polygnotus employed but few colours, and 
those simple. Technically his art was primitive. His excellence 
lay in the beauty of his drawing of individual figures; but 
especially in the "ethical" and ideal character of his art. The 
contemporary, and perhaps the teacher, of Pheidias, he had the 
same grand manner. Simplicity, which was almost childlike, 
sentiment at once noble and gentle, extreme grace and charm 
of execution, marked his works, in contrast to the more 
animated, complicated and technically superior paintings of 
a later age. (P. G.) 

POLYGON (Gr. iro\v$ } many, and yuvia, an angle), in geo- 
metry, a figure enclosed by any number of lines — the sides — 
which intersect in pairs at the corners or vertices. If the sides 
are coplanar, the polygon is said to be " plane "; if not, then it 
is a " skew " or " gauche " polygon. If the figure lies entirely 
to one side of each of the bounding lines the figure is " convex"; 
if not it is "re-entrant" or "concave." A "regular" polygon 
has all its sides and angles equal, i.e. it is equilateral and equi- 
angular; if the sides and angles be not equal the polygon is 
"irregular." Of polygons inscriptible in a circle an equilateral

figure is necessarily equiangular, but the converse is only true 
when the number of sides is odd. The term regular polygon 
is usually restricted to " convex" polygons; a special class of 
polygons (regular in the wider sense) has been named " star 
polygons " on account of their resemblance to star-rays; these 
are, however, concave. 

Polygons, especially of the *' regular " and " star " types, were 
extensively studied by the Greek geometers. There are two 
important corollaries to prop. 32, book i., of Euclid's Elements 
relating to polygons. Having proved that the sum of the angles 
of a triangle is a straight angle, i.e. two right angles, it is readily 
seen that the sum of. the internal angles ofa polygon (necessarily 
convex) of n sides is n —2 straight angles (2w —4 right angles), for the 
polygon can be divided into n— 2 triangles by lines joining one 
vertex to the other vertices. The second corollary is that the 
sum of the supplements of the internal angles, measured in the 
same direction, is 4 right angles, and is thus independent of the 
number of sides. 

The systematic discussion of regular polygons with respect to the 
inscribed and circumscribed circles is given in the fourth book of 
the Elements. (We may note that the construction of an equilateral 
triangle and square appear in the first book.) The triangle is dis- 
cussed in props. 2-6; the square in props. 6-9; the pentagon (5-side) 
in props. 10-14; the hexagon (6-side) in prop. 15; and the quin- 
decagon in prop. 16. The triangle and square call for no special 
mention here, other than that any triangle can be inscribed or 
circumscribed to a circle. The pentagon is of more interest. Euclid 
bases his construction upon the fact that the isosceles triangle 
formed by joining the extremities of one side of a regular penta- 
gon to the opposite vertex has each angle at the base double the 
angle at the vertex. He constructs this triangle in prop. 10, by 
dividing a line in medial section, i.e. the square of one part^ equal to 
the product of the other part and the whole line (a construction given 
in book ii. 11), and then showing that the greater segment is the 
base of the required triangle, the remaining sides being each equal 
to the whole line. The inscription of a^ pentagon in a circle is 
effected by inscribing an isosceles triangle similar to that constructed 
in prop. 10, bisecting the angles at the base and producing the bisec- 
tors to meet the circle. Euclid then proves that these intersections 
and the three vertices of the triangle are the vertices of the required 
pentagon. The circumscription of a pentagon is effected by con- 
structing an inscribed pentagon, and drawing tangents to the circle 
at the vertices. This supplies a general method for circumscribing 
a polygon if the inscribed be given, and conversely. In book xiii., 
prop. 10, an alternative method for inscribing a pentagon is indicated, 
for it is there shown that^ the sum of the squares of the sides of a 
square and hexagon inscribed in the same circle equals the square 
01 the side of the pentagon. ^ It may be incidentally noticed that 
Euclid's construction of the isosceles triangle which has its basal 
angles double the vertical angle solves the problem of quinquesecting 
a right angle; moreover, the base of the triangle is the side of the 
regular decagon inscribed in a circle having the vertex as centre 
and the sides of the triangle as radius. The inscription of a hexagon 
in a circle (prop. 15) reminds one of the Pythagorean result that 
six equilateral triangles placed about a common vertex form a plane; 
hence the bases form a regular hexagon. The side of a hexagon 
inscribed in a circle obviously equals the radius of the circle. The 
inscription of the quindecagon in a circle is made to depend upon 
the fact that the difference of the arcs of a circle intercepted by 
covertical sides of a regular pentagon and equilateral triangle is 
j— i, = fst of the whole circumference, and hence the bisection 
of this intercepted arc (by book iii., 30) gives the side of the 
quindecagon. 

The methods of Euclid permit the construction of the following 
series of inscribed polygons: from the square, the 8-side or octagon, 
16- , 32- . . ., or generally 4-2"-side; from the hexagon, the 12-side 
or dodecagon, 24-, 48- . . ., or generally the 6*2 n -side; from the 
pentagon, the 10-side or decagon, 20-, 40- . . ., or generally 5*2"- 
side; from the quindecagon, the 30^, 60- . . ., or generally 15-2*- 
side. It was long supposed that no other inscribed polygons were 
possible of construction by elementary methods (i.e. by the ruler 
and compasses); Gauss disproved this by forming the 17-side, and 
he subsequently generalized his method for the (2 n +i)-side, when 
this number is prime. 

The problem of the construction of an inscribed heptagon, nonagon, 
or generally of any polygon having an odd number of sides, is readily 
reduced to the construction of a certain isosceles triangle. Suppose 
the polygon to have (2n-f 1) sides. Join the extremities of one 



side to the opposite vertex, and consider the triangle so formed. 
It is readily seen that the angle at the base is n times the angle at 
the vertex. In the heptagon the ratio is 3, in the nonagon 4, and 
so on. The Arabian geometers of the 9th century showed that the 
heptagon required the solution of a cubic equation, thus resembling 
the Pythagorean problems of "duplicating the cube" and *' tri- 
secting an angle." Edmund Halley gave solutions for the heptagon 
and nonagon by means of the parabola and circle, and by a 
parabola and hyperbola respectively. 

Although rigorous methods for inscribing the general polygons in 
a circle are wanting, many approximate ones have been devised. 
Two such methods are here given: (1) Divide the diameter of the 
circle into as many parts as the polygon has sides. On the 
diameter construct an equilateral triangle; and from its vertex 
draw a line through the second division along the diameter, 
measured from an extremity, and produce this Tine to intercept 
the circle. Then the chord joining this point to the extremity of 
the diameter is the side of the required polygon. (2) Divide the 
diameter as before, and draw also the perpendicular diameter. 
Take points on these diameters beyond the circle and at a dis- 
tance from the circle equal to one division of the diameter. Join the 
points so obtained; and draw a line from the p>oint nearest the 
divided diameter where this line intercepts the circle to the third 
division from the produced extremity; this line is the required 
length. 

The construction of any regular polygon on a given side may be 
readily performed with a protractor or scale of chords, for it is 
only necessary to lay off from the extremities of the given side 
lines equal in length to the given base, at angles equal to the interior 
angle of the polygon, and repeating the process at each extremity 
so obtained, the angle being always takr-n on the same side; or lines 
may be laid off at one half of the interior angles, describing a circle 
having the meet of these lines as centre and their length as radius, 
and then measuring the given base around the circumference. 

Star Polygons. — These figures were studied by the Pythagoreans, 
and subsequently engaged the attention of many geometers — 
Boethius, Athelard of Bath, Thomas Bradwardine, archbishop 
ol Canterbury, Johannes Kepler and others. Mystical and magical 
properties were assigned to them at an early date ; the Pythagoreans 
regarded the pentagram, the star polygon derived from the pentagon, 
as the symbol of health, the Platonists of well-being, while .others 
used it to symbolize happiness. Engraven on metal, &c it is 
worn in almost every country as a charm or amulet. 

The pentagon gives rise to one star polygon, the hexagon gives 
none, the heptagon two, the octagon one, and the nonagon two. 
In general, the number of star polygons which can be drawn with 
the vertices of an n-point regular polygon is the number of numbers 
which are not factors of n and are less than in. 




Pentagrams. 



Heptagrams. 



Nonograms. 



Number of n-point and n-side Polygons. A polygon may be 
regarded as determined by the joins of points or the meets of lines. 
The termination -gram is often applied to the figures determined 
by lines, e.g, pentagram, hexagram. It is of interest to know how 
many polygons can be formed with n given points as vertices (no 
three of which are collinear), or with n given lines as sides (no two 
of which are parallel). Considering the case of points it is obvious that 
we can join a chosen point with any one cf the remaining (n — i) 
points; any one of these (n — 1) points can be joined to any one 
of the remaining (n— 2), and by proceeding similarly it is seen that 
we can pass through the n points in (n— 1) (n— 2) ... 2*1 or 
(n — i)l ways. It is obvious that the direction in which we a pass 
is immaterial ; hence we must divide this number by 2, thus obtaining * 
(n — 1)!/2 as the required number. In a similar manner it may 
be shown that the number of polygons determined by n lines is. 
(n — 1)!/2. Thus five points or lines determine 12 pentagons, 
6 points or lines 60 hexagons, and so on. 

Mensuration. — In the regular polygons the fact that they can be 
inscribed and circumscribed to a circle affords convenient expres- 
sions for their area, &c. In a n-gon, i.e, a polygon with n-sides, 
each side subtends at the centre the angle 2x/», i.e. s6o°ln t and 
each internal angle is (n— 2)x/n or (n— 2) iSo°fn. Calling the 
length of side a we may derive the following relations: Area

The table at foot of p. 1592 gives the value of the internal angle 
(a), the angle subtended at the centre by a side, area (A), radius 
of the circum-circle (R), radius of the inscribed circle (r) for the

POLYGONACEAE, in botany, a natural order of Dicotyledons, 
containing 30 genera with about 700 species, chiefly in the north 
temperate zone, and represented in Great Britain by three 
genera, Polygonum, Rumex (Dock, q.v.) and Oxyria. They are 

mostly herbs characterized by the 
union of the stipules into a 
sheath or ocrea, which protects the 
younger leaves in the bud stage 
(fig. 1). Some are climbers, as, for 
instance, the British Polygonum 
Convolvulus (black bindweed). In 
Muehlenbeckia plalyclada, a native 
of the Solomon Islands, the stem 
and branches are flattened, form- 
ing ribbon-like cladodes jointed at 
the nodes. The leaves are alter- 
nate, simple and generally entire; 
the edges are rolled back in the 
bud. They are generally smooth, but sometimes, especially in 
mountain species, woolly. The small regular, generally her- 
maphrodite flowers are borne in large numbers in compound 
inflorescences, the branches of which are cymose. The parts of 
the flower are whorled (cyclic) or acyclic. The former arrange- 
ment may be derived from a regular trimerous flower with two 
whorls of perianth leaves, two staminal whorls and a three-sided 
ovary — such a flower occurs in the Californian genus Pterostegia 
(fig. 2). The flower of rhubarb {Rheum) is derived from 
this by doubling in the outer staminal whorl (fig. 3), and

that of the dock (Rumex) by doubling in the outer staminal 
whorl and suppression of the inner (fig. 4). In Koenigia, a 
tiny annual less than an inch high, native in the arctic and 
sub-arctic regions and the Himalayas, there is one perianth and 
one staminal whorl only. Dimerous whorled flowers occur in 
Oxyria (mountain sorrel), another arctic and alpine genus, the 
flowers of which resemble those of Rumex but are dimerous 
(fig. 5). In the acyclic flowers a 5-merous perianth is followed

by 5 to 8 stamens as in Polygonum (fig. 6). The perianth leaves 
are generally uniform and green, white or red in colour. They 
are free or more or less united, and persist till the fruit is ripe, 
often playing a part in its distribution, and affording useful 
characters for distinguishing genera or species. Thus in the docks 



the three inner leaves enlarge and envelope the fruit as three 
membranous wings one or more of which bear on the back large 
fleshy warts. Less often, as in the South American genus 
Triplaris, the three outer perianth leaves form the agent of 
distribution, developing into long flat membranous wings, the 
whole mechanism suggesting a shuttlecock. The number of the 
carpels is indicated by the three-sided (in dimerous flowers two- 
sided) ovary, and the number of the styles; the ovary is uni- 
locular and contains a single erect ovule springing from the top 
of the floral axis (fig. 7). The fruit is a dry one-seeded nut, two- 




size).

sided in bicarpellary flowers, as in Oxyria. The straight or 
curved embryo is embedded in a mealy endosperm. The flowers 
are wind-pollinated, as in the docks (Rumex), where they are 
pendulous on long slender stalks and have large hairy stigmas; 
or insect-pollinated, as in Polygonum or rhubarb (Rheum), where 
the stigmas are capitate and honey is secreted by glands near the 
base of the stamens. Insect-pollinated flowers are rendered 
conspicuous chiefly by their aggregation in large numbers, as 
for instance in Bistort [Polygonum Bistorla), where the perianth 
is red and the flowers are crowded in a spike. In buckwheat 
(q.v., P. Fagopyrum) the numerous flowers have a white or red 
perianth and are perfumed; they are dimorphic, i.e. there are 
two forms of flowers, one with long styles and short stamens, 
the other with short styles and long stamens. In other cases 
self-pollination is the rule, as in knot-grass (P. aviculare), where 
the very small, solitary odourless flowers are very rarely visited 
by insects and pollinate themselves by the incurving of the three 
inner stamens on to the styles. 

Polygonaceae is mainly a north temperate order. A few genera 
are tropical, e.g. Coccoloba, which has 125 species restricted to tropical 
and sub-tropical America. Polygonum has a very wide distribution 
spreading from the limits of vegetation in the northern hemisphere 
to the mountains of tropical Africa and South Africa," through the 
highlands of tropical Asia to Australia, and in America as far south 
as Chile. Most of the genera have, however, a limited distribution. 
Of the three which are native in the British Isles, Polygonum has 



POLYGONAL NUMBERS— POLYHEDRON 



12 species; Rutnex (fig. 8) (1 1 species) includes the various species of 
dock (q.v.) and sorrel (R. Acetosa); and Oxyrta digyna, an alpine 
plant (mountain sorrel), takes its generic name (Gr. 6£0s t sharp) 
From the acidity of its leaves. Rheum (Rhubarb, q.v.) is central 
Asiatic. 

POLYGONAL NUMBERS, in mathematics. Suppose we have 
a number of equal circular counters, then the number of counters 
which can be placed on a regular polygon so that the tangents to 
the outer rows form the regular polygon and all the internal 
counters arc in contact with its neighbours, is a "polygonal 
number " of the order of the polygon. If the polygon be a 
triangle then it is readily seen that the numbers are 3, 6, 10, 15 
... and generally |n (» + 1); if a square, 4, 9, 16, . . . and gener- 
ally n 2 ; if a pentagon, 5, 12, 22. . . and generally m(3«-i); if a 
hexagon, 6, 15, 28, .. . and generally n(2n—i); and similarly for a 
polygon of r sides, the general expression for the corresponding 
polygonal number is \n[(n — 1) (r— 2) +2]. 

Algebraically, polygonal numbers may be regarded as the sums 
of consecutive terms of the arithmetical progressions having 1 for 
the first term and 1, 2, 3, ... for the common differences. Taking 
unit common difference we have the series 1; 1+2=3; 1+2+3 
= 6; 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10; or generally 1+2+3 ... + n = 
i«(n+i); these are triangular numbers. With a common difference 
2 wc have 1; i+3= : 4; 1+3 + 5=9; i+3 + 5+7 = i6; 
or generally 1+3+5+ ■••-** (2fl-i)=« s ; and generally for 
the polygonal number of the rth order we take the sums of consecu- 
tive terms of the series 

1, i + (r-2), 1+2 (r-2), . . . i+n-i.r-2; 
and hence the nth polygonal number of the rth order is the sum of 
n terms of this series, i.e., 

i + i + (r-2) + i+2(r-2)+ . . . +(i+n-i.r-2) 
=n+\n.n — i.r— 2. 
The series 1, 2, 3, 4, ... or generally n, are the so-called " linear 
numbers " (cf. Figurate Numbers). 

POLYHEDRAL NUMBERS, in mathematics. These numbers 
are related to the polyhedra (see Polyhedron) in a manner 
similar to the relation between polygonal . numbers (see above) 
and polygons. Take the case of tetrahedral numbers. Let AB, 
AC, AD be three covertical edges of 
a regular tetrahedron. Divide AB, 
. . . into parts each equal to A 1, so 
that tetrahedra having the common 
vertex A are obtained, whose linear 
dimensions increase arithmetically. 
Imagine that we have a number of 
spheres (or shot) of a diameter equal 
to the distance Ai. It is seen that 
4 shot having their centres at the 
vertices of the tetrahedron Ai will form 
a pyramid. In the case of the tetra- 
hedron of edge A2 we require 3 along each side of the base, i.e. 
6, 3 along the base of Ai, and 1 at A, making 10 in all. To add 
a third layer, we will require 4 along each base, i.e. 9, and 1 in 
the centre. Hence in the tetrahedron A3 we have 20 shot. 
The numbers 1,4, 10, 20 are polyhedral numbers, and from their 
association with the tetrahedron are termed " tetrahedral 
numbers." 

This illustration may serve for a definition of polyhedral 
numbers: a polyhedral number represents the number of equal 
spheres which can be placed within a polyhedron so that the 
spheres touch one another or the sides of the polyhedron. 

In the case of the tetrahedron we have seen the numbers to be 
1, 4, 10, 20; the general formula for the nth tetrahedral number is 
Jn(n + i)(n+2). Cubic numbers are i, 8, 27, 64, 125, &c; 
or generally n % . Octahedral numbers arc 1,6, 19,44, &c, or generally 
f«(2fl 2 + i). Dodecahedral numbers are 1, 20, 84, 220, &c; or 
generally in(gn i —gn+2). Icosahedral numbers are 1, 12, 48, 
124, &c., or generally £tt(5n 2 — 5n+2). 

POLYHEDRON (Gr. TroXus, many, 'i8pa, a base), in geometry, 
a solid figure contained by plane faces. If the figure be entirely 
to one side of any face the polyhedron is said to be " convex, " 
and it is obvious that the faces enwrap the centre once; if, on the 
other hand, the figure is to both sides of every face it is said to be 
" concave, " and the centre is multiply enwrapped by the faces. 
" Regular polyhedra " are such as have their faces all equal 
regular polygons, and all their solid angles equal; the term is 




usually restricted to the five forms in which the centre is singly 
enclosed, viz. the Platonic solids, while the four polyhedra in 
which the centre is multiply enclosed are referred to as the 
Keplcr-Poinsot solids, Kepler having discovered three, while 
Poinsot discovered the fourth. Another group of polyhedra 
are termed the "Archimedean solids," named after Archimedes, 
who, according to Pappus, invented them. These have faces 
which are all regular polygons, but not all of the same kind, 
while all their solid angles are equal. These figures are often 
termed " semi-regular solids," but it is more convenient to restrict 
this term to solids having all their angles, edges and faces equal, 
the latter, however, not being regular polygons. 

Platonic Solids. The names of these five solids are: (1) the 
tetrahedron, enclosed by four equilateral triangles; (2) the cube 
or hexahedron, enclosed by 6 squares; (3) the octahedron, 
enclosed by 8 equilateral triangles; (4) the dodecahedron, en- 
closed by 12 pentagons; (5) the icosahedron, enclosed by 20 
equilateral triangles. 

The first three were certainly known to the Egyptians; and 
it is probable that the icosahedron and dodecahedron were added 
by the Greeks. The cube may have originated by placing three 
equal squares at a common vertex, so as to form a trihedral angle. 
Two such sets can be placed so that the free edges are brought 
into- coincidence while the vertices are kept distinct. This 
solid has therefore 6 faces, 8 vertices and 12 edges. The equi- 
lateral triangle is the basis of the tetrahedron, octahedron and 
icosahedron. 1 If three equilateral triangles be placed at a 
common vertex with their covertical sides coincident in pairs, 
it is seen that the base is an equal equilateral triangle; hence four 
equal equilateral triangles enclose a space. This solid has 4 
faces, 4 vertices and 6 edges. In a similar manner, four covertical 
equilateral triangles stand on a square base. Two such sets placed 
base to base form the octahedron, which consequently has 8 
faces, 6 vertices and 12 edges. Five equilateral triangles coverti- 
cally placed would stand on a pentagonal base, and it was found 
that, by forming several sets of such pyramids, a solid could be 
obtained which had 20 triangular faces, which met in pairs to 
form 30 edges, and in fives to form 12 vertices. This is the 
icosahedron. That the triangle could give rise to no other solid 
followed from the fact that six co vertically placed triangles formed 
a plane. The pentagon is the basis of the dodecahedron. Three 
pentagons may be placed at a common vertex to form a solid 
angle, and by forming several such sets and placing them in 
juxtaposition a solid is obtained having 12 pentagonal faces, 
30 edges, and 20 vertices. 

These solids played an important part in the geometry of the 
Pythagoreans, and in their cosmology symbolized the five ele- 
ments: fire (tetrahedron), air (octahedron), water (icosahedron), 
earth (cube), universe or ether (dodecahedron). They were 
also discussed by the Platonists, so much so that they became 
known as the " Platonic solids." Euclid discusses them in the 
thirteenth book of his Elements, where he proves that no more 
regular bodies are possible, and shows how to inscribe them in a 
sphere. This latter problem received the attention of the 
Arabian astronomer Abul Wefa (10th century a.d.), who solved 
it with a single opening of the compasses. 

Mensuration of the Platonic Solids. — The mensuration of the regular 
polyhedra is readily investigated by the methods of elementary 
geometry, the property that these solids may be inscribed in and 
circumscribed to concentric spheres being especially useful. 

If F be the number of faces, n the number of edges per face, m 
the number of faces per vertex, and / the length of an edge, and if 
wc denote the angle between two adjacent faces by I, the area by A, 
the volume by V, the radius of the circum-sphere by R.and of the 
in-sphere by r, the following general formulae hold, a being written 
for 2x/n, and p for 2r/m: — 

Sin JI =cos 0/sin o; tan JI =cos 0/(sin* a-cos s 0)i. 

A = i/%F cot a. 
V = irA = ^/»n F tan JI cot 1 a 

= A* 3 " F cot 1 a cos 0/(sin* o-cos s 0)J. 
R = }/ tan JI tan = i/ sin 0/(sin s o-cos* 0)i. 
r = J/ tan JI cot a=jl cot a cos ff/(sin* a— cos 8 0)1.

Kepler- Poinsol Polyhedra. — These solids have all their faces 
equal regular polygons, and the angles at the vertices all equal. 
They bear a relation to the Platonic solids similar to the 
relation of " star polygons " to ordinary regular polygons, 
inasmuch as the centre is multiply enclosed in the former 
and singly in the latter. Four such solids exist: (1) small 
stellated dodecahedron; (2) great dodecahedron; (3) great 
stellated dodecahedron; (4) great icosahedron. Louis Poinsot 
discussed these solids in his memoir, " Sur les polygones et les 
polyedres " (Journ. £cole poly, [iv.] 1810), three of them having 
been previously considered by Kepler. They were afterwards 
treated by A. L. Cauchy (Journ. Ecole poly, [ix.] 1813), who 
showed that they were derived from the Platonic solids, and 
that no more than four were possible. A. Cayley treated 
them in several papers (e.g. Phil. Mag., 1859, 17, p. 123 seq.), 
considering them by means of their projections on the 
circumscribing sphere and not, as Cauchy, in solido. 

The small stellated dodecahedron is formed by stellating the Platonic 
dodecahedron (by " stellating " is meant developing the faces con- 
tiguous to a specified base so as to form a regular pyramid). It has 
12 pentagonal faces, and 30 edges, which intersect in fives to form 12 
vertices. Each vertex is singly enclosed by the five faces; the 
centre of each face is doubly enclosed by the succession of faces about 
the face ; and the centre of the solid is doubly enclosed by the faces. 
The great dodecahedron is determined by the intersections of the 
twelve planes which intersect the Platonic icosahedron in five of its 
edges; or each face has the same boundaries as the basal sides 
of five co vertical faces of the icosahedron. It is the reciprocal 
(see below) of the small stellated dodecahedron. Each vertex 
is doubly enclosed by the succession of co vertical faces, while the 
centre of the solid is triply enclosed by the faces. The great stellated 
dodecahedron is formed by stellating the faces of a great dodecahe- 
dron. It has 12 faces, which meet in 30 edges; these intersect in 
threes to form 20 vertices. Each vertex is singly enclosed by the 
succession of faces about it; and the centre of the solid is quadruply 
enclosed by the faces. The great icosahedron is the reciprocal of 
the great stellated dodecahedron. Each of the twenty triangular 
faces subtend at the centre the same angle as is subtended by four 
whole and six half faces of the Platonic icosahedron; in other words, 
the solid is determined by the twenty planes which can be drawn 
through the vertices of the three faces contiguous to any face of 
a Platonic icosahedron. The centre of the solid is. septuply enclosed 
by the faces. 

A connexion between the number of faces, vertices and edges of 
regular polyhedra was discovered by Euler, and the result, which 
assumes the form E ~{-2:~ F -j-V, where E, F, V arc the number 
of edges, faces and vertices, is known as Euler's theorem on poly- 
hedra. This formula only holds for the Platonic solids, Poinsot 
guve the formula E + 2k = eV + F, in which k is the number of 
times the projections of the faces from the centre on to the surface 
of the circumscribing sphere make up the spherical surface, the area 
of a stellated face being reckoned once, and e is the ratio " angles at a 
vertex /27r" as projected on the sphere, E, V, F being the same as 
before. Cayley gave the formula E + 2D = eV + e'F, where 
e 9 E, V, F are the same as before, D is the same as Poinsot's k with 
the distinction that the area of a stellated face is reckoned as the sum 
of the triangles having their vertices at the centre of the face and 
standing on the sides, and e' is the ratio : " the angles subtended at 
the centre of a face by its sides /2r."

hedra ; n denotes the number of sides to a face, «i the number of faces

Archimedean Solids. — These solids are characterized by 
having all their angles equal and all their faces regular 
polygons, which are not all of the same species. Thirteen 
such solids exist. 

1. The truncated tetrahedron is formed by truncating the vertices 
of a regular tetrahedron so as to leave the original faces hexagons. 
(By the truncation of a vertex or edge we mean the cutting 'away of 
the vertex or edge by a plane making equal angles with all the faces 
composing the vertex or with the two faces forming the edge.) It 
is bounded by 4 triangular and 4 hexagonal faces; there are 18 edges, 
and 12 vertices, at each of which two hexagons and one triangle are 
co vertical. 

2. The cuhoctahedron is a tesserescae-decahedron (Gr. reaaapes-Kai- 
Saca, fourteen) formed by truncating the vertices of a cube so as to 
leave the original faces squares. It is enclosed by 6 square and 
8 triangular faces, the latter belonging to a coaxial octahedron. It 
is a common crystal form. 

3. The truncated cube is formed in the same manner as the 
cuboctahedron, but the truncation is only carried far enough to 
leave the ' original faces octagons. It has 6 octagonal faces 
(belonging to the original cube), and 8 triangular ones (belonging to 
the coaxial octahedron). 

4. The truncated octahedron is formed by truncating the vertices 
of an octahedron so as to leave the original faces hexagons; con- 
sequently it is bounded by 8 hexagonal and 6 square faces. 

5. 6. Rhombicuboctaheara. — Two Archimedean solids of 26 
faces are derived from the coaxial cube, octahedron and semi- 
regular (rhombic) dodecahedron (see below). The *' small rhombi- 
cuboctahedron " is bounded by 12 pentagonal, 8 triangular and 
6 square faces; the " great rhombicuboctahedra " by 12 decagonal, 
8 triangular and 6 square faces. 

7. The icosidodecahedron or dyocaetriacontahedron (Gr. hvo-Kal- 
Tpi&KovTa, thirty-two), is a 32-faced solid, formed by truncating the 
vertices of an icosahedron so that the original faces become triangles. 
It is enclosed by 20 triangular faces belonging to the original icosa- 
hedron, and 12 pentagonal faces belonging to the coaxial dodecahe- 
dron. 

8. The truncated icosahtdron is formed similarly to the icosidode- 
cahedron, but the truncation is only carried far enough to leave the 
original faces hexagons. It is therefore enclosed by 20 hexagonal 
faces belonging to the icosahedron, and 12 pentagonal faces belonging 
to the coaxial dodecahedron. 

9. The truncated dodecahedron is formed by truncating the vertices 
of a dodecahedron parallel to the faces of the coaxial icosahedron 
so as to leave the former decagons. It is enclosed by 20 triangular 
faces belonging to the icosahedron and 12 decagons belonging to the 
dodecahedron. 

10. The snub cube is a 38-faced solid having at each corner 4 tri- 
angles and 1 square; 6 faces belong to a cube, 8 to the'eoaxial 
octahedron, and the remaining 24 to no regular solid. 

11. 12, The rhombicosidodecahedra. — Two 62-faced solids are 
derived from the dodecahedron, icosahedron and the semi-regular

triacontahedron. In the "small rhombicosidodecahedron" there 
are 12 pentagonal faces belonging to the dodecahedron, 20 triangular 
faces belonging to the icosahedron and 30 square faces belonging 
to the triacontahedron. In the "great rhombicosidodecahedron 
the dodecahedral faces arc decagons, the icosahcdral hexagons 
and the triacontahedral squares; this solid is sometimes called the 
" truncated icosidodecahedron." 

13. The snub dodecahedron is a Q2 -faced solid having 4 triangles 
and a pentagon at each corner. The pentagons belong to a dodeca- 
hedron, and 20 triangles to an icosahedron ; the remaining 60 triangles 
belong to no regular solid. 

Semi-regular Polyhedra. — Although this term is frequently 
given to the Archimedean solids, yet it is a convenient de- 
notation for solids which have all their angles, faces, and edges 
equal, the faces not being regular polygons. Two such solids 
exist: (1) the "rhombic dodecahedron," formed by trun- 
cating the edges of a cube, is bounded by 12 equal rhombs; it 
is a common crystal form (see Crystallography) ; and (2) the 
" semi-regular triacontahedron," which is enclosed by 30 equal 
rhombs. 

The interrelations of the polyhedra enumerated above are con- 
siderably elucidated by the introduction of the following terms: 
(1) Correspondence. Two polyhedra correspond when the radii 
vectores from their centres to the mid- point of the edges, centre of 
the faces, and to the vertices, can be brought into coincidence. (2) 
Reciprocal. Two polyhedra are reciprocal when the faces and ver- 
tices of one correspond to the vertices and faces of the other. (3) 
Sutnmital or facial. A polyhedron (A) is said to be the summita! 
or facial holohedron of another (B) when the faces or vertices of A 
correspond to the edges of B, and the vertices or faces of A corre- 
spond to the vertices and faces together of B. (4) Hemihedral. 
A polyhedron is said to be the hemihedral form of another poly- 
hedron when its faces correspond to the alternate faces of the latter 
or holohedral form; consequently a hemihedral form has half the 
number of faces of the holohedral form. Hemihedral forms are of 
special importance in crystallography, to which article the reader 
is referred for a fuller explanation of these and other modifications 
of polyhedra (tetartohedral, enantiotropic, &c). 

It is readily seen that, the tetrahedron is its own reciprocal, i.e. 
it is self-reciprocal; the cube and octahedron, the dodecahedron and 
icosahedron, the small stellated dodecahedron and great dodeca- 
hedron, and the great stellated dodecahedron and great icosahedron 
are examples of reciprocals. We may also note that of the Archime- 
dean solids: the truncated tetrahedron, truncated cube, and trun- 
cated dodecahedron, are the reciprocals of the crystal forms triakis- 
tetrahedron, triakisoctahedron and triakisicosahedron. Since the 
tetrahedron is the hemihedral form of the octahedron, and the octa- 
hedron and cube are reciprocal, we may term these two latter solids 
" reciprocal holohedra " of the tetrahedron. Other examples of 
reciprocal holohedra are: the rhombic dodecahedron and cubocta- 
hedron, with regard to the cube and octahedron; and the semi- 
regular triacontahedron and icosidodecahedron, with regard to the 
dodecahedron and icosahedron. As examples of facial holohedra 
we may notice the small rhombicuboctahedron and rhombic dode- 
cahedron, and the small rhombicosidodecahedron and the semi- 
regular triacontahedron. The correspondence of the faces of poly- 
hedra is also of importance, as may be seen from the manner in which 
one polyhedron may be derived from another. Thus the faces 
of the cuboctahedron, the truncated cube, and truncated octahe- 
dron, correspond; likewise with the truncated dodecahedron, trun- 
cated icosahedron, and icosidodecahedron ; and with the small and 
great rhombicosidodecahedra. 

The general theory of polyhedra properly belongs to combinatorial 
analysis. The determination of the number of different polyhedra 
of n faces, i.e. w-hedrons, is reducible to the problem : In now many 
ways can multiplets, i.e. triplets, quadruplets, &c, be made with n 
symbols, so that (1) every contiguous pair of symbols in one multiplet 
are a contiguous pair in some other, the first and last of any mul- 
tiplet being considered contiguous, and (2) no three symbols in any 
multiplet shall occur in any other. This problem is treated by 
the Rev T. P. Kirkman in the Manchester Memoirs (1855, 1857- 
1860); and in the Phil. Trans. (1857).

POLYMETHYLENES, in chemistry, cyclic compounds, the 
simplest members of which arc saturated hydrocarbons of 
general formula CnH^, where n may be 1 to 9, and known as 
tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and hepta-methylene, &c, or cyclo- 
propane, -butane, -pentane, -hexane, -heptane, &c: —

The unsaturated members of the series are named on the 



Geneva system in which the termination -ane is replaced hy-ene, 
-diene, -triene, according to the number of double linkages in 
the compound, the position of such double linkages being 
shown by a numeral immediately following the suffix ~ene; 
for example I. is methyl-cyc/0-hexadiene — 1. 3. An alterna- 
tive method employs A. v. Baeyer's symbol A. Thus 
A 2-4 indicates the presence of two double bonds in 
the molecule situated immediately after the carbon atoms 
2 and 4; for example II. is A 2-4 dihydrophthalic acid.

As to the stability of these compounds, most trimethylene 
derivatives are comparatively unstable, the ring being broken 
fairly readily; the tetramethylene derivatives are rather more 
stable and the penta- and hexa-methylcne compounds are very 
stable, showing little tendency to form open chain compounds 
under ordinary conditions (see Chemistry: Organic). 

Isomerism. — No isomerism can occur in the monosubstitution 
derivatives but ordinary position isomerism exists in the di- 
and poly-substitution compounds. Stereo-isomerism may 
occur: the simplest examples are the dibasic acids, where 9, cis- 
(maleinoid) form and a trans- (fumaroid) form have been ob- 
served. These isomers may frequently be distinguished by 
the facts that the ds-acids yield anhydrides more readily than 
the 2ra«s-acids, and are generally converted into the trans-acids 
on heating with hydrochloric acid. O. Aschan (Ber. t 1902, 35, 
P- 3389) depicts these cases by representing the plane of the 
carbon atoms of the ring as a straight line and denoting the 
substituted hydrogen atoms by the letters X, Y, Z. Thus for 
dicarboxylic acids (COaH = X) the possibilities are represented by 

(cis), ^ (trans), ^ (1). 

The trans compound is perfectly asymmetric and so its mirror 
image (I) should exist, and, as all the trans compounds syn- 
thetically prepared are optically inactive, they are presumably 
racemic compounds (see O. Aschan, Chemie der alicyklischen 
VerUndungen, p. 346 seq.). 

General Methods of Formation. — Hydrocarbons may be ob- 
tained from the dihalogen paraffins by the action of sodium or 
zinc "dust, provided that the halogen atoms are not attached 
to the same or to adjacent carbon atoms (A. Freund, Monats., 
1882, 3, p. 625; W. H. Perkin, jun., Jottm. Chem. Soc, 1888, 53, 
p. 213):— 

by the action of hydriodic acid and phosphorus or of phos- 
phomum iodide on benzene hydrocarbons (F. Wreden, Ann., 
1877, 187, p. 153; A. v. Baeyer, ibid., 1870, 155, p. 266), ben- 
zene giving methylpentamethylene; by passing the vapour of 
benzene hydrocarbons over finely divided nickel at 180-250 C. 
(P. Sabatier and J. B. Senderens, Comptes rendus, 1901, 132, p. 
210 seq.); and from hydrazines of the type CnHjn-rNH-NHj 
by oxidation with alkaline potassium ferricyanide (N. Kijner, 
Joum. prak. Chem., 1901, 64, p. 113). Unsaturated hydro- 
carbons of the series may be prepared from the corre- 
sponding alcohols by the elimination of a molecule of water, 
using either the xanthogenic ester method of L. Tschugaeff 
(Ber. 1899, 32, p. 3332): C„H 2n _ 1 ONa-^C„H 2n . 1 0-CS-SNa(R) 
— ^C„H2n^2+COS+R-SH; or simply by dehydrating with 
anhydrous oxalic acid (N. Zelinsky, Ber., 1901, 34, p. 3249); 
and by eliminating the halogen acid from mono- or di-halogen 
polymethylene compounds by heating them with quinoline. 

Alcohols are obtained from the corresponding halogen com- 
pounds by the action of moist silver oxide, or by warming them 
with silver acetate and acetic acid; by the reduction of ketones 
with metallic sodium; by passing the vapours of monohydric 
phenols and hydrogen over finely divided nickel (P. Sabatier and 
J. B. Senderens, loc. cit.); by the reduction of cyclic esters with

elements of water to the unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons on 
boiling with dilute acids. 

Aldehydes and Ketones. — The aldehydes are prepared in the 
usual manner from primary alcohols and acids. The ketones 
are obtained by tbe dry distillation of the calcium salts of di- 
basic saturated aliphatic acids (J. Wislicenus, Ann., 1893, 275, 
p. 309): [CH 2 -CH 2 -C0 2 ] 2 Ca-^[CH 2 -CH 2 ] 2 CO; by the action of

converted into a tetramethylene carboxylic ester by the action 
of bromine on its disodium derivative (W. H. Perkin and 
Sinclair, ibid., 1829, 61, p. 36). The esters of the acids may

and by the Grignard reaction (S. Malmgren, Bet., 1903, 36, pp. 
668, 2622; N. Zelinsky, ibid., 1902, 35, p. 2687). 



Cyclo-propane Croup. 

Trimethylene^ CaH 6 , obtained by A. Freund (Monals., 1882, 3, 
p. 625) by heating trimethylene bromide with sodium, is a gas, which 
may be liquefied, the liquid boiling at — 3§° C. (749 mm.). It dis- 
solves gradually in concentrated sulphuric acid, forming propyl 
sulphate. Hydriodic acid converts it into n-propyl iodide. It is 
decomposed by chlorine in the presence of sunlight, with explosive 
violence. It is stable to cold potassium permanganate. 

Cyc\o-propane carboxylic acid, C 3 H 6 'C02H, is prepared by heating 
the 1.1-dicarboxylic acid; and by the hydrolysis of its nitrile, formed 
by heating 7-chlorbutyro-nitrile with potash (L. Henry and P. Dalle, 
Chem. Centralblatt, 1901, 1, p. 1357; 1902, 1, p. 913). ._It is a colour- 
less oil, moderately soluble m water. 

The 1.1 dicarboxylic acid is prepared from ethylene dibromide and 
sodio-malonic ester. The ring is split by sulphuric or hydrobromic 
acids. The cis 1.2-cydo-propane dicarboxylic acid is formed by elimi- 
nating carbon dioxide from cyc/o-propane tricarboxylic acid -1.2.3 
(from ajS-dibrompropionic ester and sodio-malonic ester). The 
trans-acid is produced on heating pyrazolin-4.5-dicarboxylic ester, 
or by the action of alcoholic potash on a-bromglutaric ester. It 
does not yield an anhydride. 

Cyclo-butane Group. 
Cyc\o-butane, C4H 8 , was obtained by R. Willstiitter (Ber., 1907, 
40, p. 3979) by the reduction of cyclobutene^ by the Sabatier and 
Senderens method. It is a colourless liquid which boils at n-12 C, 
and its vapour burns with a luminous flame. Reduction at 180- 
200 C. by the above method gives n-butane. 

Cyc\o-butene, C4H6, formed by distilling trimethyl-cyc/o-butyU 
ammonium hydroxide, boils at 1.5-2.0 C. (see N. Zelinsky, ibid., 
p. 4744; G. Schweter, ibid., p. 1604). 

When sodio-malonic ester is condensed with trimethylene bromide 
the chief product is ethyl pentane tetracarboxylate, tetramethylene 
1. 1 -dicarboxylic ester being also formed, and from this the free 
acid may be obtained on hydrolysis. It melts at 154-156 C, 
losing carbon dioxide and passing into cyc/0-butane carboxylic acid, 
C4H7CO2H. This basic acid yields a monobrom derivative which, 
by the action of aqueous potash, gives the corresponding hydroxy- 
cyclo-butane carboxylic acid, C4H6(OH)-C02H. Attempts to elimi- 
nate water from this acid and so produce an unsaturated acid were 
unsuccessful; on warming with sulphuric acid, carbon monoxide 
is eliminated and cyc/o-butanone (keto-tetramethylene) is probably 
formed. 

The truxillic acids, Ci 8 Hi 6 04» which result by the hydrolytic split- 
ting of truxilline, CsgHw^Og, are phenyl derivatives of cyc/o-butane. 
Their constitution was determined by C. Liebermann (Ber., 1888, 
21, p. 2342; 1889, 22, p. 124 seq.). They are polymers of cinnamic 
acid, into which they readily pass on distillation. The a-acid 
on oxidation yields benzoic acid, whilst the /S-acid yields benzil 
in addition. The a-acid is diphenyl-24-cyc/o-butane dicarboxylic 
acid -1.3; and the j9-acid diphenyl-34-cyclo-butane dicarboxylic 
acid -1.2. By alkalis they are transformed into stereo-isomers, 
the a-acid giving y-truxillic acid, and the /S-acid 5-truxiIlic acid. 
The a-acid was synthesized by C. N. Riiber (Ber., 1902, 35, p. 241 1; 
1904, 37, p. 2274), by oxidizingdiphenyl-2.4-cyc/o-butane-bjsmethy- 
lene malonic acid (fron cinnamic aldehyde and malonic acid in the 
presence of quinoline) with potassium permanganate. 

QycXo-pentane Croup. 
Derivatives may be prepared in many cases by the breaking down 
of the benzene ring when it contains an accumulation of negative 
atoms (T. Zincke, Ber., 1886-1894; A. Hantzsch, Ber. t 1887, 20, p. 
2780; 1889, 22, p. 1238), this type of reaction being generally brought 
about by the action of chlorine on phenols in the presence of alkalis 
(see Chemistry: Organic). A somewhat related example is seen in 
the case of croconic acid, which is formed by the action of alkaline

Hexa-oxybenzene. Rhodizonic acid. Croconic acid. 
Cyclo-pentane, C 6 H 10 , is obtained from cyc/o-pentanone by reducing 
it to the corresponding secondary alcohol, converting this into the 
iodo-compound, which is finally reduced to the hydrocarbon (J. 
Wislicenus, Ann., 1893, 275, p. 327). It is a colourless liquid which 
boils at 50-51 ° C. Methyl-cyc\o-pentane, C 6 H 9 CHs, first obtained 
by F. Wreden {Ann., 1877, 187, p. 163) by the action of hydriodic 
acid and red phosphorus on benzene, and considered to be liexahydro- 
benzene, is obtained synthetically by the action of sodium on 1-5 
dibromhexane ; and by the action of magnesium on acetylbutyl 
iodide (N. Zelinsky, Ber„ 1902, 35, p. 2684). It is a liquid boiling

pentadiene, C 6 H 6 , is found in the first runnings from crude benzene 
distillations. It is a liquid which boils at 41 ° C. It rapidly poly- 
merizes to di-cyc/o-pentadiene. The *CH 2 * group is very reactive 
and behaves in a similar manner to the grouping *CO*CH 2 ;CO* in 
open chain compounds, e.g. with aldehydes and ketones it gives the

crystallizes in deep red prisms. Dimethylfulven is an orange- 
coloured oil which oxidizes rapidly on exposure. Concentrated 
sulphuric acid converts it into a deep red tar. 

Cyc\o-pentanone, C 6 H 8 0, first prepared pure by the distillation of 
calcium adipate (J. Wislicenus, Ann., 1893, 275, p. 312), is also ob- 
tained by the action of sodium on the esters of pimelic acid; by the 
distillation of calcium succinate; and by hydrolysis of the cyclo- 
pentanonc carboxylic acid, obtained by condensing adipic and 
oxalic esters in the presence of sodium ethylate. Reduction gives 
cyc/o-pentanol, C 6 H«OH. 

Croconic acid (dioxy-cyc/o-pentene-trione), C 6 H 2 06, is formed when 
triquinoyl is boiled with water, or by the oxidation of hexa-oxyben- 
zene or dioxydiquinoyl in alkaline solution (T. Zincke, Bet., 1887, 
20, p. 1267). It has the character of a quinone. On oxidation it 
yields cyc/o-pentane-pentanone (leuconic acid). 

Derivatives of the cyc/o-pentane group are met with in the break- 
ing-down products of the terpenes (q.v.). 

Campholactone, C9H14O2, is the lactone of trimethyl-2-2*3-cyc/0- 
pentanol-5-carboxylic acid-3. For an isomer, isocampholactone 
(the lactone of trimethyl-2-2-3-cyc/0-pentanol-3-carboxyhc acid-i) 
see W. H. Perldn, jun., Proc Chem. Soc. f 1903, 19, p. 61. Lauronolic 
acid, C«Hm0 2 , is trimethyl-2'2'3-cyc/0-pentene-4-acid-i. Isolauro- 
nolic acid, QH14O2, is trimethyl-2-2-3-cyc/o-pentene-3-acid-4. 

Campholic acid, Ci H 18 Oi, is tetramethyl-i-2*2-3-cyc/o-pentane

QycXo-hexane Group. 
Hydrocarbons. — QycXo-hexane, or hexahydro benzene, C«Hu, is 
obtained by the action of sodium on a boiling alcoholic solution of 
i*6-dibromhexane, and by passing the vapour of benzene, mixed 
with hydrogen, over finely divided nickel. It is a liquid with an odour 
like that of benzene. It boils at 80-81 C. Nitric acid oxidizes it to 
adipic acid. When heated with bromine in a sealed tube for some 
days at 150-200 C, it yields i*2*4'5-tetrabrombenzene (N. Zelinsky, 
Ber., 1901, 34, p. 2803). It is stable towards halogens at ordinary 
temperature. Benzene hexachloride, C«H«CI«, is formed by the 
action of chlorine on benzene in sunlight. By recrystallization 
from hot benzene, the a form is obtained in large prisms which melt 
at 1 57 C, and at their boiling-point decompose into hydrochloric 
acid and trichlorbenzene. The form results by chlorinating 
boiling benzene in sunlight, and may be separated from the a variety 
by distillation in a current of steam. It sublimes at about 310 C. 
Similar varieties of benzene hexabromide are known. 
m Hexahydrocymene t (methyl- i-isopropyl-4-cyc/o-hexane), C 10 H 2C , is 
important since it is the parent substance of many terpenes (q.v.). 
It is obtained by the reduction of 1*4 dibrommenthane with sodium 
(J. de Montgolfier, Ann. chim. phys., 1880 [5], 19, p. 158), or of 
cymene, limonene, &c, by Sabatier and Senderens's method. 
It is a colourless liquid which boils at 180 C 

QycXo-hexene (tetrahydrobenzene), C«H 10 , was obtained by A. v. 
Baeyer by removing the elements of hydriodic acid from iodo- 
cyc/o-hexane on boiling it with quinoline. It is a liquid which boils 
at 82 ° C. Hypochlorous acid converts it into 2-chlor-cyc/o-hexanol-i , 
whilst potassium permanganate oxidizes it to cyc/<?-hexandi-ol. 
9 Cyclo-hexadiene (dihydrobenzene), C«H 8 . — Two isomers are pos- 
sible, namely cyc/o-hexadiene-i-3 and cyc/o-hexadiene-i*4. A. v. 
Baeyer obtained what was probably a mixture of the two by 
heating 1*4 dibrom-cyc/o-hexane with quinoline. C. Harries {Ann., 



.w.i yields succinic 
and oxahc acids. The 1*4 compound also boils at 81-82 C. and on 
oxidation gives succinic and malonic acids. 

Alcohols.— QycXo*hexanol, C«H n OH, is produced by the reduction 
of the corresponding ketone, or of the iodhydrin of quinite. Nitric 
acid oxidizes it to adipic acid, and chromic acid to cyc/o-hexanone. 
Quimte (cyc/o-hexanediol-i -4) is prepared by reducing the correspond- 
ing ketone with sodium amalgam, cis-, and /raws-modifications 
being obtained which may be separated by their acetyl derivatives. 
Phloroglucite (cyc/o-hexane-triol-i^.j) is obtained by reducing an 
aqueous solution of phloroglucin with sodium (W. Wislicenus, Ber., 
1894, 27, p. 357). 'QuercHt (cyc/<>-hexane-pentol-i-2-3'4-5), isolated 
trom acorns in 1849 by H.-Braconnot (Ann. chim. phys. [3], 27, 



C. 392), crystallizes in colourless prisms which melt at 234 C. When 
eated in vacuo to 240 C. it yields hydroquinone, quinone and 
pyrogallol. It is dextro-rotatory. A laevo-form occurs in the 
leaves of Gymncma sylvestre (F. B. Power, Journ. Chem. Soc, 1904, 
85. p. 624). 

Inosite (cyc/o-hexane-hexol), C«H«(OH)«.— The inactive form occurs 
in the muscles of the heart and in other parts of the human body. 
The d-iovm is found as a methyl ether in pinite (from the juice oiPinus 
lambertina, and of caoutchouc iromMateza roritina of Madagascar), 
from which it may be obtained by heating with hydriodic acid. 
The /-form is also found as a methyl ether in quebrachite. By 
mixing the d~ and /- forms, a racemic variety melting at 253 ° C. is 
obtained. A dimethyl ether of inactive inosite is dambonite which 
occurs in caoutchouc from Gabon. 

Ketones. — QycXo-hcxanone, C«Hi C 0, is obtained by the distillation 
of calcium pimelate, and by the electrolytic reduction of phenol, 
using an alternating current. It is a colourless liquid, possessing 
a peppermint odour and boiling at 155 C. Nitric acid oxidizes it 
to adipic acid. It condenses under the influence of sulphuric acid 
to form dodecahydrotriphenylene, Cu>Hj4, and a mixture of ketones 
(C. Mannul, Ber., 1907, 40, p. 15*). Methyl-i-cycXo-hexanone-3, 
CHrC«H«0, is prepared by the hydrolysis of pulegone. It is an 
optically active liquid which boils at 168-169 C Homologues of 
menthone may be obtained from the ketone by successive treatment 
with sodium amide and alkyl halides (A. Haller, Comples rendus, 
1905, 140, p. 127). On oxidation with nitric acid (sp. gr. 1*4) at 

60-70 C, a mixture of — and methyl adipic acids is obtained 

(W. Markownikoff, Ann., 1905, 336, p. 299). It can be transformed 
into the isomeric methyl-\-cyc\o-hexanone-2 (O. Wallach, Ann., 1904, 
329, p. 368). For methyl-i-cydO'hexanone-4, obtained by distilling 
7-methyl pimelate with lime, see O. Wallach, Ber., 1906, 39, 
p. 1492. 

QycXo-hexane-dione-i*$ (dihydroi-esorcin), C«H 8 0i, was obtained 
by G. Merling (Ann., 1894, 278, p. 28) by reducing resorcin in hot 
alcoholic solution with sodium amalgam. Cyc\o-hexane-dione-i*A is 
obtained by the hydrolysis of succino-succinic ester. On reduction 
it yields quinite. It combines with benzaldehyde, in the presence 
of hydrochloric acid, to form 2-benzyl-hydroquinone. Cyclo- 
hexane-trione-i*2>*$ (phloroglucin) is obtained by the fusion of many 
resins and of resorcin with caustic alkali. It may be prepared 
synthetically by fusing its dicarboxylic ester (from malonic ester 
and sodio malonic ester at 145 C.) with potash (C. W. Moore, 
Journ. Chem. Soc, 1904, 85, p. 165). It crystallizes in prisms, which 
melt at 21 8° C. With ferric chloride it gives a dark violet 
coloration.^ It exhibits tautomerization, since in many of its 
reactions it shows the properties of a hydroxylic substance. 
Rhodizonic acid (dioxydiquinoyl), C«HjO«, is probably the enolic 
form of an oxypentaketo-cyc/o-hexane. It is formed by the 
reduction of triquinoyl by aqueous sulphurous acid, or in the form 
of its potassium salt by washing potassium hexa-oxybenzene with 
alcohol. (R. Nietzki, Ber., 1885, 18, pp. 513, 1838). Triquinoyl 
(hexaketo-cyc/o-hexane) C«0«*8H 2 0, is formed on oxidizing rhodi- 
zonic acid or hexa-oxybenzene. Stannous chloride reduces it to 
hexa-oxybenzene, and when boiled with water it yields croconic 
acid (dioxy-cyc/o-pentene-trione). 

Qyclo-hexenones. — Two types of ketones are to be noted in this 
group, namelythe cgS and /S7 ketones, depending upon the position 
of the double linkage in the molecule, thus: 

y CH 2 :CH /CH-CH lv 

H 5 C< \C0 HCf >C0 

N:h 2 ch 2 / x:h,.ch/ 

(«/5) Ifiy) 

These two classes show characteristic differences in properties. 
For example, on reduction with zinc and alcoholic potash, the a/8 
compounds give saturated ketones and also bi-molecular compounds, 
the /S7 being unaffected; the £7 series react with hydroxylamine 
in a normal manner, the ajS yield oxamino-oximes. 

M&hyl-i-cyc\o-hexcne-i-one-3,CHfCiH 7 0, is obtained by condens- 
ing sodium aceto-acetate with methylene iodide, the ester so formed, 
being then hydrolysed. I socamphor phorone, C>H M 0, is trimethyl 
j-6-6.-cyc/0-hexene-i-one 6. Isocampkor, QoHuO, is methyl-i- 
isopropyl-3-cyc/o-hexene-i-one 6. 

Acids. — Rtxahydrobenzoic acid, C«Hn-COiH, is obtained by the 
reduction of benzoic acid, or by the condensation of 1*5 dibrompen- 
tane with disodio-malonic ester. It crystallizes in small plates which 
melt at 30-31° C. and boil at 232-233 C. (J. C. Lumsden, Journ. 
Chem. Soc., m igo$ t 87, p. 90). The sulphochloride of the acid on 
reduction with tin and hydrochloric acid gives hexahydrothio phenol, 
C«HuSH, a colourless oil which boils at 158-160 C. (W. Borsche, 
Ber., 1906, 39, p. 392). 

Qxiinic acid, C«H 7 (OH) 4 COjH (tetra-oxy-cyc/o-hexane carboxylic 
acid), is found in coffee beans and in guinia bark. It crystallizes 
in colourless prisms and is optically active. When heated to about 
250 ° C. it is transformed into quinide, probably a lactone, which on 
heating with baryta water gives an inactive quinic acid. 

Hexahydrophtkalic acids, C«H lc (COiH), (cyc/0-hexanedicarboxylic 
acids). — Three acids of this group are known, containing the Carb- 
oxyl-groups in the 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 positions, and each exists in two 
stereo-isomeric forms (cis- and trans-). The anhydride of the cis-i-2

acid, obtained by heating the anhydride of the trans-acid, forms prisms 
which melt at 192 C. When heated with hydrochloric , acid it passes 
into the /rans-variety. The racemic /raws-acid is produced by the 
reduction of the dihydrobromide of A 4 -tetrahydrophthalic acid or 
A 2 * 6 dihydrophthalic acid. It is split into its active components 
by means of its quinine salt (A. Werner and H. E. Conrad, Ber., 
1899, 32, p. 3046). Hexahydroisophthalic acids (c^c/o-hexane-i'3- 
dicarboxyhc acids) are obtained by the action of methylene iodide on 
disodio-pentane tetracarboxylic ester (W. H. Perkin, Journ. Chem. 
Soc, 1891, 59, p. 798); by the action of trimethylene bromide on 
disodio-propane tetracarboxylic ester; and by the reduction of 
isophthalic acid with sodium amalgam, the tetrahydro acids first 
formed being converted into hydrobromides and further reduced 
(A. v. Baeyer and V. Villiger, Ann., 1893, 276, p. 255). The cis- 
and trans- forms can be separated by means of their sodium salts. 
The /raws-acid is a racemic compound, which on heating with acetyl 
chloride gives the anhydride of the ct's-acid. 

Hexahydroterephthalic acids (c;yc/0-hexane-i*4-dicarboxylic acids). 
These acids are obtained by the reduction of the hydrobromides of 
the di- and tetra-hydroterephthalic acids or by the action of ethylene 
dibromide on disodio-butane tetracarboxylic acid. An important 
derivative is succino-succinic acid, CjHjO^C^HJs, or cyclo-hexane- 
dione-2*5-dicarboxylic acid-I*4, which is obtained as its ester 
by the action of sodium or sodium ethylate on succinic ester (H. 
Fehling, Ann., 1844, 49, p. 192; F. 
Hermann, Ann., 1882, 211, p. 306). 
It crystallizes in needles or prisms, and 
dissolves in alcohol to form a bright 
blue fluorescent liquid, which on the 
addition of ferric chloride becomes 
cherry red. The acid on heating loses 
CO2 and gives cyc/o-hexanedione-i*4. 

Tetrahydrobenzoic acid (cyclo-hexene- 
i-carboxylic acid-i), C«H 9 -C0 2 H. Three 
structural isomers are possible. The 
A 1 acid results on boiling the A 2 acid 
with alkalis, or on eliminating hydro- 
bromic acid from i-brom-cyr/o-hexane- 
carboxylic acid-l. The A 2 acid is 
formed on the reduction of benzoic acid 
with sodium amalgam. The A 3 acid is 
obtained by eliminating the elements of 
water from 4-oxy-cyc/o-hexane-i-carb- 
oxylic acid (W. H. Perkin, iun., Journ. 
Chem. Soc., 1904, 85, p. 431). Shikimic 
acid (3- 4- 6-tnoxy- A 1 -tetrahydrobenzoic 
acid) is found in the fruit of Illicium 
religiosum. On fusion with alkalis it 
yields para-oxy benzoic acid, and nas- 
cent hydrogen reduces it to hydro- 
shikimic acid. Sedanolic acid, C12H20O3, 
which is found along with sedanonic 
acid^ C12H18O3, in the higher boiling 
fractions of celery oil, is an ortho- 

oxyamyl-A 6 -tetrahydrobenzoic acid, sedanonic acid being ortho- 
valeryI-A x -tetrahydrobenzoic acid(G. Ciamician and P. Silber, Ber., 
^897, 30, pp. 492, 501, 1419 seq.). Sedanolic acid readily decom- 
poses into water and its lactone sedanolid, C12H18O2, the odorous 
constituent of celery oil. 

Tetrahydro phthalic acids (cyclo - hexene dicarboxylic acids), 
C«H 8 (C0 2 H)2. Of the ortho-series four acids are known. # The 
A 1 acid is obtained as its anhydride by heating the A 2 acid to 
220 C, or by distilling hydropyromellitic acid. Alkaline rxrtassium 
permanganate oxidizes it to adipic acid. The A 2 acid is formed 
along with the A 4 acid by reducing phthalic acid with sodium 
amalgamjn hot solutions. The A* acid exists in cis- and /raws- 
forms, 
and 



with acetic anhydride. When boiled with caustic soda it isomerizes 
to a mixture of the A 2 ** and A 2 " 6 dihydrophthalic acids. The A 2 ' 4 
acid is obtained by boiling the dihydrobromide of the A 2 * 8 acid with 
alcoholic potash or by continued boiling of the A 2 ' 6 acid with 
caustic soda. 

The A 2 ' 6 acid is formed when phthalic acid is reduced in the cold by 
sodium amalgam or by heating the A 2 '* and A 3 * 6 acids with caustic 
soda. The /raws-modification of A 3 * 5 acid is produced when phthalic 
acid is reduced by sodium amalgam in the presence of acetic acid. 
When heated for some time with acetic anhydride it changes to the 
cis-form. The trans-acid has been resolved by means of its 
strychnine salts into two optically active isorrierides, both of which 
readily pass to A 2 * 6 dihydrophthalic acid (A. Neville, Journ. Chem. 
Soc, 1906, 89, p. 1744)- 

Of the dihydroterephthalic acids, the A 1 ' 8 acid is obtained by heat- 
ing the dibromide of the A 2 tetrahydro acid with alcoholic potash. It 
cannot be prepared by a direct reduction of tere phthalic acid. On 
warming with caustic soda it is converted into the A 1 ' 4 acid. The A 1 " 4 
acid is also obtained by the direct reduction of terephthalic acid. 
It is the most stable of the dihydro acids. The A 1 ' 5 acid is obtained 
by boiling the cis- and *rans- A 2 ' 6 acids with water, which are obtained 
on reducing terephthalic acid with sodium amalgam in faintly alka- 
line solution. The relationships existing between the various 
hydrophthalic acids may be shown as follows: —

along with the A 4 (cis) acid b>r reducing isophthalic acid. The 
trans A* acid is formed by heating the as-acid with hydrochloric 
acid under pressure. The A 3 acid is formed when the anhydride 
of tetrahydro rimesic acid is distilled (W. H. Perkin, junr., Journ. 
Chem. Soc, 1905, 87, p. 293). 

In the para-series, three acids are known. The A 1 acid is formed 
by the direct reduction of terephthalic acid; by boiling the A 2 acid 
with caustic soda; and by the reduction (in the heat) of A 1 ' 4 dihydro- 
terephthalic acid. The A 2 acid exists in cis- and trans- forms; these 
are produced simultaneously in the reduction of A 1 '* or A 1 ' 5 dihydro- 
terephthalic acids by sodium amalgam. 

There are five possible dihydrobenzoic acids. One was obtained 
in the form of its amide by the reduction of benzamide in alkaline 
solution with sodium amalgam (A. Hutchinson, Ber., 1891, 24, 
p. 177).^ The A 1 * 8 acid is obtained on oxidizing dihydrobenzalde- 
hyde with silver oxide or by the reduction of meta-trimethyl- 
aminobenzoic acid (R. Willstatter, Ber., 1904, 37, p. 1859). 

Of the dihydrophthalic acids, five are known in the ortho-series, 
two of which are stereo-isomers of the cis- and trans-typQ, and a 
similar number are knbwn in the para-series. The A 1 ' 4 acid is 
obtained as its anhydride by heating A 2 ' 4 dihydrophthalic anhydride 



Cyc\o-heptane Group. 

Cycio-heptane (suberane), C7H14, obtained by the reduction of 
suberyl iodide, is a liquid which boils at 117 C. On treatment 
with bromine in the presence of aluminium bromide it gives chiefly 
pentabromtoluene. When heated with hydriodic acid to 230 C. 
it gives methylhexamethyjene ; On oxidation with nitric acid 
(sp. gr. 1*4) it yields pimelic acid. Disuberyl, C 7 Hi3-C7Hi 3 , a thick 
oily liquid, boiling at 290-291 ° C, is obtained by the reduction of 
suberyl bromide. 

Cyc\o-heptene, C7H12, is obtained by the action of alcoholic potash 
on suberyl iodide; and from cyclo-heptane carboxylic acid, the amide 
of which by the action of sodium hypobromite is converted into 
cyclo-heptSLnamine, which, in its turn, is destructively methylated 
(R. Willstatter, Ber., 1901, 34, 131). Cyclo-heptadiene 1-3, C7H10, 
is obtained from cyclo-heptene (Willstatter, loc. cit.). It is identical 
with the hydrotropilidine, which results by the destructive mcthyla- 
tion of tropane. 

Euterpene (trimethyl-i^^-cyc/o-heptadiene 1*5), Ci Hi 6 is prepared 
from dihydroeucarveol. By the action of hydrobromic acid (in 
glacial acetic acid solution) and reduction of the resulting product 
it yields i*2-dimethyl-4-ethylbenzene (A. v. Baeyer, Ber., 1897, 30, 
p. 2075). Cyc\o-he ptatriene (tropilidine), C 7 H 8 , is formed on dis- 
tilling tropine with baryta; and from cyclo-heptadiene by forming 
its addition product with bromine and heating this with quinoline 
to 150-160 C. (R. Willstatter, loc. cit.). Chromic acid oxidizes it 
to benzoic acid and benzaldehyde. With bromine it forms a di- 
bromide, which then heated^ to no° C. decomposes into hydro- 
bromic acid and benzyl bromide* 

Cyclo-heptanol, C1H13OH, is formed by the reduction of suberone, 
and by the action of silver nitrite on the hydrochloride of cyclo- 
hexanamine (N. Demjanow, Centralblatt, 1904, i. p. 1 2 14). 

Cyc\o-heptanone (suberone), C7H12O, is formed on the dis- 
tillation of suberic acid with lime, and from a-brom-^c/o-heptane 
carboxylic acid by treatment with baryta and subsequent distilla- 
tion over lead peroxide (R. Willstatter, Ber.. -1898, 31, p. 2507). 
It is a colourless liquid having a peppermint odour, and^ boiling 
at I78'5-I79*5° C. Nitric acid oxidizes it to »-pimelic acid.

Tropilene, C7H10O, is obtained in small quantities by the distillation 
of a- methyl tropine methyl hydroxide, and by the hydrolysis of 0- 
methyltropidinc with dilute hydrochloric acid. It is an oily liquid, 
with an odour resembling that of benzaldehydc. It forms a benzal 
compound, and gives an oyxmethylcne derivative and cannot be 
oxidized to an acid, reactions which point to it being a ketone con- 
taining the grouping -CHi'CO-. It is thus to be regarded as a 
cyc/o-heptene-i-one-7. 

Cyc\o-heptane carboxylic acid (subcranic acid), C7HHCO2H, is 
obtained by the reduction of c^c/o-heptene-i-carboxy!ic acid; 
from brom-cydo-heptane by the Gngnard reaction; and by the re- 
duction of hydrotropilidinc carboxylic acid by sodium in alcoholic 
solution (R. Will stilt ter, Ber., 1898, 31, p. 2504). The corresponding 
oxyacid is obtained by the hydrolysis of the nitrile, which is formed 
by the addition ol hydrocyanic acid to subcrone (A. Spiegel, Ann., 
1882, 2ii, p. 117). 

Four cych'heptene carboxylic acids are known. Cyclo-heptene-i- 
carboxylic acid-i is prepared from oxysuberanic acid. This acid 
when heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid to 120-130 C. 
yields a chlor-acid, which on warming with alcoholic potash is trans- 
formed into the cyclo-heptene compound. Cyc\o-heptene-2-carboxylic 
acid-i is formed by the reduction of cyc/o-hcrjtatriene 2'4-6-carb- 
oxylic acid- 1. On boiling with caustic soda it isomerizes to the 
corresponding l-acid. 

Cyc\o-heptatriene carboxylic acids, C7H7CO2H. All four are 
known. According to F. Buchner (Ber., 1898, 31, p. 2242) they may 
be represented as Follows: —

The a-acid (a-isophenylacetic acid) is obtained by the hydrolysis 
of pscudophenylacetamide, formed by condensing diazoacetic ester 
with benzene, the resulting pseudophenyl acetic ester being then left 
in contact with strong ammonia for a long time. p-I sophenylacetic 
acid is formed by strongly heating pseudophenylacetic ester in an 
air-free sealed tube and hydrolysing the resulting 0-isophenylacetic 
ester. y-Isophenylacetic acid is obtained by heating the and 5 
acids for a long time with alcoholic potash (A. Einhorn, Ber., 1894, 
27, p. 2828; E. Buchner, Ber., 1898, 31, p. 2249). t-Isophenyl- 
acetic acid is obtained by heating the iodmethylate of anhydro- 
ecgonine ester with dilute caustic soda (A. Einhorn, Ber., 1893, 26, 
p. 329). 

Numerous amino-derivatives of the cyc/o-heptane series have been 
prepared by R. WiHstatter in the course of his investigations on the 
constitution of tropine (q.v.). A mino-cy do-heptane (subcrylamine) 
is obtained by the reduction of suberone oxime or by the action of 
sodium hypobromitc on the amide of cycloheptane carboxylic acid. 

Cyc\o-octane Group. 

Few members of this group are known. By the distillation of the 
calcium salt of azelaic acid H. Mayer (Ann., 1893, 275, p. 363) 
obtained azelain ketone, C 8 H u O, a liquid of peppermint odour. 
It boils at 90-9 1 ° C. (23 mm.) and is readily oxidized by potassium 
permanganate to oxysuberic acid. It is apparently cyc/o-octanone 
(see also W. Miller and A. Tschitschkin, Centralblatt, 1899, 2., 
p. 181). VV 

Pseudopelletierine^ (methyl granatonine), C 9 Hi«NO, an alkaloid of 
the pomegranate, is a derivative of cyclo-octanc, and resembles 
tropine in that it contains a nitrogen bridge between two carbon 
atoms. It is an inactive base, and also has ketonic properties. 
On oxidation it yields methyl granatic ester, which, by the exhaustive 
mcthylation process, is converted into homopiperylene dicarboxylic 
ester, HOiCCHrCHCHrCHrCHiCHCO^H, from which suberic 
acid may be obtained on reduction. When reduced in alcoholic 
solution bv means of sodium amalgam it yields methyl granatoline, 
CsHuOH-NCHt; this substance, on oxidation with cold potassium 
permanganate, is converted into granatoline, C 8 Hi S NO, which on 
distillation over zinc dust yields pyridine. Methyl granatoline on 
treatment with hydriodic acid and red phosphorus, followed by 
caustic potash, yields methyl granatininc, C 8 Hi S N, which when heated 
with hydriodic acid and phosphorus to 240 C. is converted into 
methyl granatanine, C 8 Hn.NCH lf and granatanine, C 8 H H NH. The 
hydrochloride of the latter base when distilled over zinc dust yields 
a-rjropyl pyridine. By the electrolytic reduction of pseudopellet- 
lenne, iV-methyl granatanine is obtained, and this by exhaustive 
methylation is converted into A V«-dimethyl granatanine. This 
latter compound readily forms an iodmethylate, which on treatment 
with silver oxide yields the corresponding ammonium hydroxide. 
The ammonium hydroxide on distillation decomposes into trimethyl- 
amine, water and cyc/o-octadienei -3.

CycXo-octadiene, C 8 Hi,, as above prepared, is a strong-smelling oil 
which decolorizes potassium permanganate solution instantaneously. 
It readily polymerizes to a di-cyc/o-octadiene and polymer (CsHu)* 
(R. Willstattcr, Ber., 1905, 38, pp. 1975, 1984; G. Ciamician and P. 
Silbcr, Ber., 1893, 26, p. 2750; A. Piccinini, Gazz., 1902, 32, 1 p. 260). 
0-cyc\o~octadiene has been prepared from methyl granatinine 
iodmethylate. 

Cyc\o-octane, C 8 Hi 8 is obtained by the reduction of the above 
unsaturated hydrocarbon by the Sabatier and Senderens's method. 
It is a liquid which boils at 146-3-14.8° C. and possesses a strong 
camphor odour. On oxidation it yields suberic acid (R. WiHstatter, 
Ber., 1907, 40, pp. 957). O. Doebner (Ber., 1902, 35, pp. 2129, 
2538; 1903, 36, p. 4318) obtained compounds, which in all probabi- 
lity are cyc/o-octadienes, by the distillation of 0-vinylacryTic acid, 
sorbic acid, and cinnamenyl acrylic acid with anhydrous baryta. 

Cyc\o-nonane Group. 
According to N. Zelinsky (Ber., 1907, 40, p. 780) cyclononancne, 
CgHnO, ahquid boiling at 95797° C, is formed on distilling sebacic 
acid with lime, and from this, by reduction to the corresponding- 
secondary alcohol, conversion of the latter into the iodide, and 
subsequent reduction of this with zinc, cyc\ononane, CHis, a liquid 
boiling at 170-172° C. is obtained. 

POLYNESIA, (Gr. 7roXfa, many, and vrjaos, island), a term 
sometimes used to cover the whole of the oceanic islands in 
the central and western Pacific, but properly for the eastern 
of the three great divisions of these islands. The chief groups 
thus included are Hawaii, the Ellice, Phoenix, Union, Manihiki 
and Marquesas groups, Samoa and Tonga, the Cook, Society, 
Tubuai and Tuamotu groups, and many other lesser islands. 
(See Pacific Ocean, section on Island, and separate articles 
on the principal groups, &c.) 

The Polynesian Race. — For the ethnological problems offered 
by Polynesia no thoroughly satisfactory solutions have yet been 
found. By some the term Polynesian has been treated as a 
synonym for Malayo-Polynesian, and has been made to include 
all the brown races of Malaysia, Melanesia, Micronesia and 
Polynesia. Linguistically, physically and mentally this view 
is untenable. Whatever be the origin of the Polynesians, they 
are not Malays, though, themselves of mixed blood, they have 
probably certain racial elements in common with the latter, 
who are undoubtedly hybrids. There is every reason to be- 
lieve that the Polynesians are ethnologically a far older race 
than the Malays, who, as they now exist, are a comparatively 
modern people; and thus Friedrich Muller's and D. G. Brinton's 
theory, that they form a branch of the Malays, fails. Joseph 
Deniker declares the Polynesians a separate ethnic group of 
the Indo-Pacific area, and in this view he is followed by A. H. 
Keane, who suggests that they are a branch of the Caucasic 
division of mankind who possibly migrated in the Neolithic 
period from the Asiatic mainland. Of the migration itself no 
doubt is now felt, but the first entrance of the Polynesians into 
the Pacific must have been an event so remote that neither by 
tradition nor otherwise can it be even approximately fixed. 
The journey of these Caucasians would naturally be in stages. 
Their earliest halting place was probably the Malay Archi- 
pelago, where a few of their kin linger in the Mentawi Islands 
on the west coast of Sumatra. Thence at a date within historic 
times a migration eastward took place. The absence of San- 
skrit roots in the Polynesian languages appears to indicate that 
this migration was in pre-Sanskritic times. Whether anything 
like a definite date can be fixed for it may well be questioned. 
Abraham Fornander 1 has, however, with great probability, 
traced back the history of the Hawaiians to the 5th century. 
He has studied the folk-lore of those islands exhaustively, and 
from this source comes to the conclusion that the Polynesian 
migration from the Indian Archipelago may be approximately 
assigned to the close of the jst or to the 2nd century. The 
traditions of many of the Polynesian peoples tend to make 
Savaii, the largest of the Samoan Islands, their ancestral home 
in the East Pacific, and linguistic and other evidence goes to

POLYNESIA 



support the theory that the first Polynesian settlement in the 
East Pacific was in Samoa, and that thence the various branches 
of the race made their way in all directions. Most likely Saitfoa 
was the first group permanently occupied by them. Owing 
to the admixture of the Polynesians with the Papuans in Fiji 
some authorities have thought the first settlement was in 
those islands, and that the settlers were eventually driven thence 
by the Papuan occupiers. We can, however, account for the 
presence of Polynesian blood in Fiji in another way, viz. by the 
intercourse that has been kept up between the people of Tonga 
and Fiji. If the first resting-place of the Polynesians was in 
that group, there is good reason to believe that Samoa was the 
first permanent home of the race. 

It used to be doubted whether these people could have gone 
from the Indian archipelago so far eastward, because the pre- 
vailing winds and currents are from the east. But it is now 
well known that at times there are westerly winds in the region 
over which they would have to travel, and that there would be no 
insuperable difficulties in the way of such a voyage. The Poly- 
nesians are invariably navigators. There is ample evidence 
that in early times they were much better seamen than they 
are at present. Indeed their skill in navigation has greatly 
declined since they have become known to Europeans. They 
used to construct decked vessels capable of carrying one or two 
hundred persons, with water 'and stores sufficient for a voyage 
of some weeks duration. These vessels were made of planks 
well fitted and sewn together, the joints being caulked and 
pitched. 1 It is only in recent times that the construction of 
such vessels has ceased. The people had a knowledge of 
the stars, of the rising and setting of the constellations at 
different seasons of the year; by this means they determined 
the favourable season for making a voyage and directed their 
course. 

The Polynesians were by no means a savage people when 
they entered the Pacific. Indeed their elaborate historical 
legends show that they possessed a considerable amount of 
civilization. Those who are familiar with these legends, and 
have studied native manners and customs, see many unmis- 
takable proofs that the Polynesians had, at their migration, 
considerable knowledge and culture, and that the race has 
greatly deteriorated. 

The Polynesians are physically a very fine race. On some 
islands they average 5 ft. 10 in. in height. De Quatrefages, 
in a table giving the stature of different races of men, 2 puts the 
natives of Samoa and Tonga as the tallest people in the world. 
He gives 5 ft. 9*92 in. as their average height. They are well 
developed in proportion to their height. Their colour is a brown, 
lighter or darker generally according to the amount of their 
exposure to the sun — being darker on some of the atolls where 
the people spend much time in fishing, and among fishermen 
on the volcanic islands, and fighter among women, chiefs and 
others less exposed than the bulk of the people. Their hair 
is dark brown or black; smooth and curly, very different from 
the frizzly mop of the Papuan or the lank straight locks of the 
Malay. They have very little beard. Their features are gen- 
erally fairly regular and often beautiful; eyes invariably black, 
and in some persons oblique; jaws not projecting, except in a 
few instances; lips of medium thickness; the noses are naturally 
long, well shaped and arched, but many are artificially flat- 
tened at the bridge in infancy. Their foreheads are fairly high, 
but rather narrow. The young of both sexes are good-looking. 
The men often have more regular features than the women. 
Formerly the men paid more attention to personal appearance 
than the women. Polynesians generally are of singularly 
cleanly habits, love bathing, and have a taste for neatness and 
order. Their clothing is simple: a loin cloth for the men and 
for the women a girdle or petticoat of leaves. Sometimes 
women cover the shoulders, an4 on great occasions the men 
robe themselves in tapa, bark-cloth. The men are usually

tattooed in elaborate designs from the navel to the thigh, and 
often around mouth and eyes. 

As a race the Polynesians are somewhat apathetic. An 
enervating climate and lavish natural resources incline them to 
lead easy lives. On the more barren islands, and on those more 
distant from the equator, they show more energy. Under 
certain circumstances they become excitable, and manifest a 
kind of care-for-no thing spirit. As savages they were strict 
in their religious observances and religion came into almost 
every action of life, and they have been, in most instances, easily 
led to accept Christianity. Their essential trait is their per- 
ennial cheerfulness, and their fondness for dance and song and 
every sort of amusement. 3 They are shrewd, intelligent and 
possess much common sense. Where they have from early 
years enjoyed the advantages of a good education, Polynesian 
youths have proved themselves to possess intellectual powers 
of no mean order. They are almost invariably fluent speakers; 
with many of them oratory seems to be a natural gift; it is also 
carefully cultivated. An orator will hold the interest of his 
hearers for hours together at a political gathering, and in his 
speech he will bring in historical aUusions and precedents, and 
will make apt quotations from ancient legends in a manner which 
would do credit to the best parliamentary orators. Many of 
them are very brave, and think little of self-sacrifice for others 
where duty or family honour is concerned. 

Polynesian society is divided into the family and the clan. Each 
clan has a name which is usually borne by one of the oldest members, 
who is the chief or head for the time being. This clan system no 
doubt generally prevailed in early times, and was the origin of the 
principal chieftainships. But changes have been made in most of 
the islands. In some the head of one clan has become king over 
several. In many cases large clans have been divided into sections 
under secondary heads, and have even been subdivided. 

Asa rule near relations do not intermarry. In some islands this 
rule is rigidly adhered to. There have been exceptions, however, 
especially in the case of high chiefs; but usually great care is taken 
to prevent the union of those within the prescribed limits of con- 
sanguinity. Children generally dwell with their kin on the father's 
side, but they have equal rights on the mother's side, and sometimes 
they take up their abode with their mother's family. The only 
names used to express particular relationships are father and 
mother, son and daughter, brother and sister. There is usually 
no distinction between brothers (or sisters) and cousins, all the 
children of brothers and sisters speak of each other as brothers and 
sisters, and they call uncles and aunts fathers and mothers. Above 
the relationship of parents all are simply ancestors, no term being 
used for grandfather which would not equally apply to any more 
remote male ancestor. In the same way there is no distinctive 
term for grandchild. A man speaks of his grandchild as his^ son 
or daughter, or simply as his child.^ Polygamy was often practised, 
especially by chiefs, and also concubinage. In some places a widow 
was taken by the brother of her deceased husband, or, failing the 
brother, by some other relative of the deceased, as an additional wife. 
Divorce was an easy matter, and of frequent occurrence ; but, as a 
rule, a divorced wife would not marry again without the consent of 
her former husband. An adulterer was always liable to be killed 
by the aggrieved husband, or by some member of his clan. If 
the culprit himself could not be reached, any member of the clan 
was liable to suffer in his stead. In some islands female virtue was 
highly regarded. Perhaps of all the groups Samoa stood highest 
in this respect. There was a special ordeal through which a bride 
passed to prove her virginity, and a proof of her immorality brought 
disgrace upon all her relatives. But in other islands there was much 
freedom in the relations of the sexes. Owing to the almost promis- 
cuous intercourse which prevailed among a portion of the race, in 
some groups titles descended through the mother and not through 
the father. In Hawaii there was a peculiar system of marriage 

8 Wrestling and boxing, a kind of hockey and football, canoe and 
foot races, walking-matches, swimming, archery, cockfighting, 
fishing-matches and pigeon -catching are among their pastimes. 
Of indoor games they have a number, many being of a gambling 
nature. Much time is spent, especially after the evening meal, 
in asking riddles, in rhyming, &c. The recital of songs and ninths 
is a common amusement, and on special occasions there is dancing. 
The night-dances were generally accompanied by much indecency 
and immorality. 

* Dr Lewis H. Morgan, in Ancient Society, pp. 419-423, makes the 
Polynesians to have distinctive terms for grandfather, grandmother, 
grandson and granddaughter. In this he is mistaken. It is evident 
from his own lists that the Hawaiian kupuna means simply an 
ancestor. In like manner moopuna simply means a descendant 
of any generation after the first.

relationship,'* brothers with their wives, and sisters with their 
husbands, possessing each other in common." There also, especially 
in the ease of chiefs and chief tainesses, brothers and sisters some- 
times intermarried. But these customs did not prevail in other 
groups. It is almost certain that they did not prevail in Hawaii in 
early times, but that they were the result of that deterioration in the 
race which their traditions and many of their customs indicate. 1 

Women have always occupied a relatively high position among 
the Polynesians. In most groups they have great influence and are 
treated with much respect. In some cases they take hereditary 
titles and hold high offices. As^ among their congeners in Mada- 
gascar, so also in parts of Polynesia, thpre may be a queen or a ehief- 
tainess in her own right ; and a woman in high position will command 
as much respect, and will exercise as great authority, as a man* would 
in the same position. Everywhere infanticide prevailed; in some 
of the smaller islands it was regulated by law in order to prevent 
over-population. It was also a very common practice to destroy 
the foetus, but parents were affectionate towards their children. 
The practice of adopting children was, and still is, common. Often 
there is an exchange made between members of the same elan; 
but sometimes there is adoption from without. Tattooing generally 
prevailed among the men, different patterns being followed in differ- 
ent groups of islands. In some a larger portion of the body is 
tattooed than in others. A youth was considered to be in his 
minority until he was tattooed, and in former times he would have 
no chance of marrying until he had, by submitting to this process, 
proved himself to be a man. Puberty in the other sex was generally 
marked by feasting, or some other demonstration, among the female 
friends. Old age is generally honoured. Often an inferior chief 
will give up his title to a younger man, yet he himself will lose but 
little by so doing. The neglect of aged persons is extremely rare. 

Property belonging to a clan is held in common. Each elan 
usually possesses land, and over this no one member has an exclusive 
right, but all have an equal right to use it. The chief or recognized 
head of the elan or section alone can properly dispose of it or assign 
its use for a time to an outsider; and even he is expected to obtain 
the consent of the heads of families before he alienates the property. 
Thus land is handed down through successive generations under the 
nominal control of the recognized head of the clan. Changes 
have been made in many islandsin this respect; but there can be 
little reason to doubt that the joint ownership of property in clans 
was common among the entire race in former times. 

In early times the head of each clan was supreme among his 
own people, but in all matters he had associated with^ him the 
principal men or heads of families in the clan. Their united 
authority extended over all the members and the possessions of the 
clan, and they were independent of every other clan. There are in 
some places vestiges of this primitive state of society still remaining; 
the transition to a limited or to a despotic monarchy may be traced 
by means of the ancient legends in some islands, and in others it is 
a matter of recent history. One elan being more numerous and 
stronger than another, and its chief being ambitious, it is easy to 
see how by conquering a neighbouring clan he increased the import- 
ance of his clan and extended his own power. In some of the islands 
this transition process has hardly yet developed into an absolute 
monarchy. We may even see two or three stages of the progress. 
Intone instance a certain clan has the right to nominate the principal 
chief over an entire district ; though it is known as the ruling clan, 
its rule is mainly confined to this nomination, and to decision for or 
against war. In all other respects the district enjoys the privilege 
of self-government. In another case the nominal king over a dis- 
trict, or over an entire island, can be elected only from among the 
members of a certain clan, the monarchy being elective within that 
alone; but this king has little authority. In other cases a more 
despotic monarchy has grown up — the prowess of one man leading 
to the subjugation of other clans. Even in this case the chiefs or 

1 Morgan has founded one of his forms of family — the consanguine 
— on the supposed existence in former times among the Malays and 
Polynesians of the custom of " intermarriage of brothers and sisters, 
own and collateral, in a group." All the evidence he finds in support 
of this is (i) the existence of the custom above mentioned in Hawaii ; 
and (2) the absence of special terms for the relationship of uncle, 
aunt and cousin, this indicating, he thinks, that these were regarded 
as fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. He admits that " the 
usages with respect to marriage which prevailed when the system 
was formed may not prevail at the present time." But he adds, 
" To sustain the deduction it is not necessary that they should " 
(Ancient Society, p. 408); Morgan has given special terms for grand- 
father and grandmother, because it would prove too much to show 
that the people had no grandfathers, &c. But these terms are used 
for ancestors of any generation. The terms used for grandchildren, 
in like manner, are used for any generation of descendants. He 
says (p. 406) the terms of husband and wife are used in common by 
a group of sisters orbrothers, but the fact is that the wqrds used for 
husband and wife in Hawaii simply mean male and female. In 
some islands^ there are terms used for wife in the most strict sense. 
The word wife is not used more exclusively among us than among 
some Polynesian people. 



heads of clans sometimes still hold their property and rule over their 
own people, only rendering a kind of feudal service and paying 
tribute to the king. 

The Polynesians are exceedingly fond of rank and of titles. Much 
deference is paid to chiefs and to persons of rank; and special 
terms are generally employed in addressing these. Every part of a 
chief's body and all his belongings have names different from those 
employed for common people. The grade of rank which a person 
occupies will often t be indicated by the language in which he is 
addressed. Thus, in Samoa there are four different terms for to 
come: sau is for a common man; maliu max is a respectful term 
for a person without a title; susu mat for a titled chief; and afio 
mat for a member of the royal family. In addressing chiefs, or 
others to whom one wishes to be respectful, the singular number 
of the personal pronoun is rarely used; the dual is employed instead, 
— the dual of dignity or of respect. 

Offices and titles are seldom hereditary in our sense of the term, 
as descending from father to son. They are rather elective within 
the limits of the clan, or the division of a clan. A common practice 
is for the holder of a high title to nominate a successor; and his 
nomination is generally confirmed by the chiefs, or heads of house- 
holds, with whom the right of election rests. In ancient times the 
authority of a high chief or king did not usually extend to any 
details of government. But in Hawaii there are traditions of a wise 
king who interested himself in promoting; the social well-being of 
the people, and made good laws for their guidance.* Usually all 
matters affecting a district or an island were settled by the chiefs 
of the district, while those of a single village were settled by a 
council consisting of the chiefs and heads of households in the village. 
In some islands each clan, or each village, would feel itself at liberty 
to make war on another clan or village without consulting the views 
of any higher authority. Indeed the rule was for each elan or dis- 
trict to settle its own affairs. In the case of offences against 
individuals, either the person injured, or another member of his 
elan, would avenge the injury done. For most offences there tf f as 
some generally recognized punishment — such as death for murder 
or adultery; but often vengeance would fall upon another person 
instead of the wrongdoer. In avenging wrong, a member of the 
village or of the clan to which the offender belonged would serve 
equally well to satisfy their ideas of justice if the culprit himself 
could not be easily reached. Sometimes all the members of the 
family, or of a village, to which a culprit belonged would flee from their 
homes and take refuge in another village, or seek the protection of a 
powerful chief. In some places, in cases of crime, the members of 
the family or village would convey the culprit bound — sometimes 
even carrying him like a pigthat is to be killed — and place him with 
apologies before those against whom he had transgressed. The 
ignominy of such a proceeding was generally considered sufficient 
atonement for the gravest offences. There were slaves in many 
islands, either persons conquered in war, or those who had been 
condemned to lose their personal liberty on account of evil conduct. 

Pottery was not manufactured by the Polynesians : a fact which, 
it has been argued, goes far to prove the remoteness of the Poly- 
nesian migration from the Malay Archipelago, where there is not a 
single tribe which does not possess the art. It may, however, be 
that, moving among small coral islands for scores of generations and 
thus without materials, they lost the art. Those of them who 
possessed pottery obtained it from the Papuans. In most of their 
manufactures they were, however, in advance of the Papuans. 
They made use of the vegetable fibres abounding in the islands, the 
women manufacturing cloth, chiefly from the bark of the paper 
mulberry (Morus papyrifera), but also in some islands from the 
bark of the bread-fruit tree and the hibiscus. This in former 
times furnished them with most of their clothing. They also made 
various kinds of mats, baskets and fans from the leaves of the pan- 
da nus, the bark of the hibiscus, from species of bohmeria or other 
Urticaceous plants. Some of their mats are very beautifully made, 
and in some islands they are the most valuable property the people 
possess. The people also use the various fibre-producing plants for 
the manufacture of ropes, coarse string and fine cord, and for making 
fishing nets. The nets are often very large, and are netted with a 
needle and mesh as in hand-netting among ourselves. 

The Polynesians, who have always been entirely without metals, 
are clever workers in wood. Canoe and house building are trades 
usually confined to certain families. The large canoes in which they 
formerly made long voyages are no longer built, but various kinds 
of smaller canoes are made, from the commonest, which is simply 
a hollowed-out tree cut into form, to the finely shaped one built 
upon a keel, the joints of the various pieces being nicely fitted, and 
the whole stitched together with cord made from the husk of coco- 
nuts. Some of the larger canoes are ornamented with rude carving; 
and in some islands they are somewhat elaborately decorated with 
inlaid mother-of-pearl. The houses are generally well and elabor- 
ately made, but nearly all the ornamentation is put on the inside of 
the roof. 

They manufacture several wooden utensils for household use,

nesian Race, ii. 89.

such as dishes or deep bowls, head-rests and stools. Having no 
metal or other vessels in which to boil water, all cooking is done by 
baking, generally in holes in the ground. They also make wooden 
gongs, or drums. They used to make wooden fishhooks, clubs, 
spears and bows. They still make wooden fishspears and carved and 
inlaid combs. They employ the bamboo for making drums and 
flutes. Formerly knives were made of bamboo, which is still some- 
times used for that purpose. In the manufacture of these things 
they employed adzes made of stone, shell or hard wood, and a wooden 
drill pointed with stone, shell or bone. They made mother-of-pearl 
fishhooks, and they still use a part of those old hooks — or artificial 
bait — in combination with steel hooks, the native-made portion 
being generally shaped like a small fish. For water-vessels, &c, 
they employ gourds and large coco-nut shells, in preparing which 
they pour in water and allow the pulp or the kernel to decay, so that 
it may be removed without breaking the rind or shell. Their drink- 
ing cups are made of half a coco-nut shell. Sharks' teeth, shells 
and bamboo were formerly generally used as cutting instruments 
for shaving and surgical operations. They employ vegetable dyes 
for painting their bark-cloth, calabashes, &c. In some islands they 
also use a red earth for this purpose. Their cloth is generally 
ornamented with geometrical patterns. Any drawings of animals, 
&c, which they make are exceedingly inartistic, and no attempt 
is made at perspective. Their musical instruments are few and rude 
— consisting of the drums and flutes already mentioned, and shell 
trumpets. 

The Polynesians were all polytheists. Without doubt many of 
their gods are deified men; but it is clear that some are the forces 
of Nature personified, while others appear to represent human 
passions which have become identified with particular persons who 
have an existence in their historical myths. 1 But the conception 
which they had of Tangaloa (Taaroa and Kanaloa in some islands) 
is of a higher order. Among the Tahitians he was regarded as 
"the first and principal god, uncreated and existing from the 
beginning, or from the time he emerged from po, or the world of 
darkness." 2 " He was said to be the father of all the gods^and 
creator of all things, yet was scarcely reckoned an object of worship." 8 
Dr Turner says, " the unrestricted, or unconditioned, may fairly 
be regarded as the name of this Samoan Jupiter." 4 

The worship of certain of the great gods was common to all the 
people in a group of islands. Others were gods of villages or of 
families, while others were gods of individuals. The gods pi clans 
were probably the spirits of the ancestors in their own line. In 
some islands, when the birth of a child was expected, the aid of the 
gods of the family was invoked, beginning with the god of the father. 
The god prayed to at the instant of birth became the god of the 
child. In other places the name of the child's god was declared 
when the umbilical cord was severed. The gods were supposed to 
dwell in various animals, in trees, or even in inanimate objects, as a 
stone, a shell, &c. In some islands idols bearing more or less resem- 
blance to the human shape were made. But in all cases the material 
objects were regarded simply as the abodes of the immaterial spirits 
of the gods. 

Their temples were either national, for a single village, or for 
the god of a family. They were sometimes large stone enclosures 
(marae), sometimes a grove, or a house. The principal priests were 
a particular order, the priesthood being hereditary. In some cases, 
however, the father of a family was priest in his own household and 
presented offerings and prayers to the family god. 

In some islands human sacrifices were of frequent^ occurrence; in 
others they were offered only on very rare and exceptional occasions, 
when the demand was made by the priests for something specially 
valuable. The usual offerings to the gods were food. The system 
of taboo was connected with their religious rites. There were two 
ways by which things might become taboo: (i) by contact with 
anything belonging to the god, as his visible representation or his 
priest. Probably it was thought that a portion of the sacred essence 
of the god, or of a sacred person, was directly communicable^ to 
objects which they touched. (2) Things were made taboo by being 
dedicated to the god ; and it is this form of taboo which is still kept up. 
If, e.g., any one wishes to preserve his coco-nuts from being taken, 
he will put something upon the trees to indicate that they are sacred 
or dedicated. They cannot then be used until the taboo js removed. 
Disease and death were often connected with the violation of taboo , 
the offended gods thus punishing the offenders. Disease was 
generally attributed to the anger of the gods. Hence offerings, &c, 
were made to appease their anger. The first-fruits of a crop were 
usually dedicated to the gods to prevent them from being angry; 
and new canoes, fishing-nets, &c, were dedicated by 'prayers and 
offerings, in order that the gods might be propitious to their owners 
in their use.

The Polynesians invariably believe in the existence of the spirit 
of man after the death of the body. Their traditions on the condi- 
tion of the dead vary considerably in different groups; yet there is a 
general agreement upon main points. Death is caused by the 
departure of the spirit from the body. The region of the dead is 
subterranean. When the spirit leaves the body it is conveyed by 
waiting spirits to the abode of spirits. In most islands the place 
of descent is known. It is generally towards the w T est. In some 
traditions there is a distinction between chief and common people 
in the spirit world. In others all are much alike in condition. Some 
traditions indicate a marked distinction between the spirits of 
warriors and those of others: the former go to a place where they 
are happy and are immortal, while the latter are devoured by the 
gods and are annihilated. In some, however, the spirits are said to 
live again after being eaten. Some speak of the abode of spirits 
as being in darkness; but usually the condition of things is similar 
to that which exists upon earth. Amongst all the people it is 
believed that the spirits of the dead are able to revisit the scenes of 
their earthly life. The visits are generally made in the night, and 
are often greatly dreaded, especially when there may be any supposed 
reason for spite on the part of the dead towards living relatives. 
Some writers have connected Polynesian cannibalism with religion. 
In the Cook and Society Islands, when a human being was offered 
as a sacrifice, the priest presented an eye of the victim to the king, 
who either ate it or pretended to do so. Probably the earliest 
human sacrifices were the bodies of enemies slain in battle. As 
it was supposed by some that the spirits of the dead were eaten by 
the gods, the bodies of those slain in battle may have been eaten by 
their victors in triumph. Mr Shortland appears to think that 
cannibalism among the Maories of New Zealand may have thus 
originated. 6 Among the Polynesians generally it appears to have 
been the practice at times to eat a portion of a slain enemy to 
make his degradation the greater. But where cannibalism was 
practised as a means of subsistence, it probably originated in times 
of actual want, such as may have occurred during the long voyages 
of the people. 

The Polynesian race has been continuously, and in some 
places rapidly, decreasing since their first contact with Euro- 
peans. Doubts have been thrown on the current statements 
regarding the rate of decrease, which some good authorities 
believe to be not so great as is commonly represented. They 
hold that former estimates of the number of inhabitants in the 
various insular groups were mere guesswork. Thus it is pointed 
out that Cook's estimate of 240,000 for the Society Archipelago 
(Tahiti) was at the time reduced by his associate, Forster, to 
150,000, so that the 300,000 credited by bim to the Sandwich 
Islands should also be heavily discounted. That is probably 
true, and it may be admitted that, as a rule, the early calcula- 
tions erred on the side of excess. But when full allowance is 
made for all such exaggerations, the following facts will show 
that the decrease has been excessive. The Tahitians, 150,000 
in 1774, fell from 17,000 in 1880 to 10,300 in 1899; and in this 
group, while the pure stock appears to be dying out, there is 
a small increase amongst the half-breeds. When New Zealand 
was occupied (1840) the Maori were said to number 120,000, 
and were doubtfully stated to be still 56,000 in 1857; since then 
the returns of the 1881 and 1891 censuses gave 44,000 and 40,000 
respectively. During the last two decades of the 19th century 
the decrease has been from 30,000 to 17,500 in Tonga; from 
11,500 to 8400 in the Cook group; from 8000 to 3600 in Wallis; 
from 1600 to 100 in Manahiki; from 1400 to 1000 in Tubuai; 
and from 600 to 100 in Easter Island. A general decline seems 
thus to be placed beyond doubt, though it may be questioned 
whether it is to be attributed to a decayed vitality, as some 
hold, or to external causes, as is the more general opinion. The 
prevalence of elephantiasis and the occurrence of leprosy, for 
instance, in Hawaii, would seem to point at least in some places 
to a racial taint, due perhaps to the unbridled licentiousness of 
past generations. On the other hand, such a decrease as has 
occurred in Tahiti and Tonga, can be accounted for only by an 
accumulation of outward causes, such as wars, massacres, and 
raidings for the Australian and South American labour mar- 
kets before this traffic was suppressed or regulated. Other 
destructive agencies were epidemics, such especially as measles 
and small-pox, which swept away 30,000 Fijians in 1875; the 
introduction of strong drinks, including, besides vile spirits, 
a most pernicious concoction brewed in Tahiti from oranges;

the too sudden adoption of European clothing, rendering the 
body supersensitive to changes of temperature; lastly, the action 
of over-zealous missionaries in suppressing the dances, merry- 
making and free joyous life of pagan times, and the preaching 
of a sombre type of Christianity, with deadening effects on the 
buoyant temperament of thes* children of Nature. Most of 
these abuses have been checked or removed, and the results 
may perhaps be detected in a less accelerated rate of decline, 
which no longer proceeds in geometric proportion, and seems 
even almost arrested in some places, as in Samoa and New 
Zealand. If such be indeed the case, perhaps the noblest of all 
primitive races may yet be saved from what at one time seemed 
inevitable extinction; and the Maori, the Samoans, and Tahi- 
tians may, like the Hawaiians, take their place beside the 
Europeans as free citizens of the various states of which they 
are now subjects.

POLYP, the name given by zoologists to the form of animal 
especially characteristic of the subphylum Cnidaria of the 
Coelcntera (q.v.). In the subdivision Anthozoa, comprising the 
sea-anemones and corals, the individual is always a polyp; in 
the Hydrozoa, however, the individual may be either a polyp or a 
medusa (q.v.). 

A good example of a polyp may be seen in a common 
sea-anemone or in the well-known fresh-water polyp, Hydra 
(fig. 1). The body may be roughly compared in structure to 

a sac, the wall of which is 
composed of two layers of 
cells. The outer layer is 
known technically as the 
ectoderm, the inner layer 
as the endoderm. Between 
ectoderm and endoderm is 
a supporting layer of struc- 
tureless gelatinous substance 
termed mesogloea, secreted 
by the cell-layers of the 
body-wall; the mesogloea 
may be a very thin layer, or 
may reach a fair thickness, 
and then sometimes contains 
skeletal elements formed by 
cells which have migrated 
into it from the ectoderm. 
The sac-like body built up 
in this way is attached 
usually to some firm object 
by its blind end, and bears 
at the upper end the mouth 
surrounded by a circle of

tentacles are hollow; but in 

some cases the tentacle, may become solid by obliteration of its 

cavity. The tentacles are organs which serve both for the tactile 

sense and for the capture of food. By means of the stinging 

nettle-cells or nematocysts with which the tentacles are thickly 

covered, living organisms of various kinds are firmly held and at 

the same time paralysed or killed, and by means of longitudinal 

muscular fibrils formed from the cells of the ectoderm the 



tentacles are contracted and convey the food to the mouth. 
By means of circularly disposed muscular fibrils formed from 
the endoderm the tentacles can be protracted or thrust out 
after contraction. By muscle-fibres belonging to the same two 
systems the whole body may be retracted or protruded. 

We can distinguish therefore in the body of a polyp the 
column, circular or oval in section, forming the trunk, resting 
on a base or foot and surmounted by the crown of tentacles, 
which enclose an area termed the peristome, in the centre of which 
again is the mouth. As a rule there is no other opening to the 
body except the mouth, but in some cases excretory pores are 
known to occur in the foot, and pores may occur at the tips of 
the tentacles.' Thus it is seen that a polyp is an animal of very 
simple structure. 

The name polyp was given to these organisms from their 
supposed resemblance to an octopus (Fr. poulpe), with its 
circle of writhing arms round the mouth. This comparison, 
though far-fetched, is certainly more reasonable than the common 
name " coral-insects " applied to the polyps which form coral. 
It cannot be too emphatically stated that a coral-polyp is as 
far removed in organization from either an octopus or an 
insect as it is from man himself. 

The external form of the polyp varies greatly in different 
cases. In the first place the column may be long and slender, 
or may be, on the contrary, so short in the vertical direction that 
the body becomes disk-like. The tentacles may number many 
hundreds or may be very few, in rare cases only one or two, or 
even absent altogether; they may be long and filamentous, or 
short and reduced to mere knobs or warts; they may be simple 
and unbranched, or they may be feathery in pattern. All these 
types are well illustrated by different species of British sea- 
anemones. The mouth may be level with the surface of the 
peristome, or may be projecting and trumpet-shaped. As regards 
internal structure, polyps exhibit two well-marked types of 
organization, each characteristic of one of the two classes, 
Hydrozoa and Anthozoa. 

It is an almost universal attribute of polyps to possess the 
power of reproducing themselves non-sexually by the method 
of budding. This mode of reproduction may be combined 
with sexual reproductiveness, or may be the sole method by 
which the polyp produces offspring, in which case the polyp 
is entirely without sexual organs. In many cases the buds 
formed do not separate from the parent but remain in con- 
tinuity with it, thus forming colonies or stocks, which may 
reach a great size and contain a vast number of individuals. 
Slight differences in the method of budding produce great varia- 
tions in the form of the colonies, which may be distinguished 
in a general way as spreading, massive or arborescent. The 
reef-building corals are polyp-colonies, strengthened by the 
formation of a firm skeleton. For further details of colony- 
formation the reader is referred to the articles Anthozoa 
and Hydromedusae.

POLYPHEMUS, in Greek mythology, the most famous of the 
Cyclopes, son of Poseidon and the nymph Thoosa. He dwelt 
in a cave in the south-west corner of Sicily, and was the owner 
of large flocks and herds. He was of gigantic stature, with 
one eye in the middle of his forehead, a consumer of human 
flesh, without respect for the laws of god or man. Odysseus, 
having been cast ashore on the coast of Sicily, fell into the hands 
of Polyphemus, who shut him up with twelve of his companions 
in his cave, and blocked the entrance with an enormous rock. 
Odysseus at length succeeded in making the giant drunk, blinded 
him by plunging a burning stake into his eye while he lay 
asleep, and with six of his friends (the others having been

devoured by Polyphemus) made his escape by clinging to the 
bellies of the sheep let out to pasture. Euripides in the Cyclops 
essentially follows the Homeric account. A later story asso- 
ciates Polyphemus with Galatea (see Acis).

POLYPODIUM, in botany, a large genus of true ferns (q.v.), 
widely distributed throughout the world, but specially developed 
in the tropics. The name is derived from Gr. 7ro\us, many, 
and irodiov, a little foot, on account of the foot-like appear- 
ance of the rhizome and its branches. The species differ greatly 
in size and general appearance and in the character of the frond; 
the sori or groups of spore-cases (sporangia) are borne on the 
back of the leaf, are globose and naked, that is, are not covered 
with a membrane (indusium) (see fig. 1). The common poly- 
pody (fig. 2) (P. vulgare) is widely diffused in the British Isles, 
where it is found on walls, 
banks, trees, &c; the creep- 
ing, densely-scaly rootstock 
bears deeply pinnately cut 
fronds, the fertile ones bear- 
ing on the back the bright 
yellow naked groups of 
sporangia (sort). It is also 
known as adder's foot, 
golden maidenhair and 
wood-fern, and is the oak- 
fern of the old herbals.

There are a large number of varieties, differing chiefly 
in the form and division of the pinnae; var. cambricum (origin- 
ally found in Wales) has the pinnae themselves deeply cut 
into narrow segments; var. cornubiense is a very elegant plant 
with finely-divided fronds; var. cristatum is a handsome variety 
with fronds forking at the apex and the tips of all the pinnae 
crested and curled. P. dry pier is , generally known as oak- 
fern, is a very graceful plant with delicate fronds, 6 to ii in. 
long, the three main branches of which are themselves pinnately 
divided; it is found in dry, shady places in mountain districts 
in Great Britain, but is very rare in Ireland. P. phegopteris 
(beech fern) is a graceful species with a black, slender root-stock, 
from which the pinnate fronds rise on long stalks, generally 
about 12 in. long, including the stalk; it is characterized by 
having the lower pinnae of the frond deflexed; it is generally 
distributed in Britain, though not common. Many other 
species from different parts of the world are known in green- 
house cultivation. 

POLYPUS, a term signifying a tumour which is attached by 
a narrow neck to the walls of a cavity lined with mucous 



membrane. A polypus or polypoid tumour may belong to any 
variety of tumour, either simple or malignant. The most com- 
mon variety is a polypus of the nose of simple character and 
easily removed. Polypi are also met with in the ear, larynx, 
uterus, bladder, vagina, and rectum. (See Tumour.) 

POLYTECHNIC (Gr. -rroXfo, many, and rexvy, an art), a 
term which may be held to designate any institution formed 
with a view to encourage or to illustrate various arts and sciences. 
It has, however, been used with different applications in several 
European countries. In France the first icole polytcchnique 
was founded by the National Convention at the end of the 18th 
century, as a practical protest against the almost exclusive 
devotion to literary and abstract studies in the places of higher 
learning. The institution is described as one " ou Ton instruit 
les jeunes gens, destines a entrcr dans les ecoles speciales 
d'artillerie, du genie, des mines, des ponts et chaussees, cree en 
1794 sous le nom d'ecole centrale des travaux publiques, et 
en 1795 sous celui qu'elle porte aujourd'hui " (LittrS). In Ger- 
many there are nine technical colleges which, in like manner, 
have a special and industrial rather than a general educational 
purpose. In Switzerland the principal educational institution, 
which is not maintained or administered by the communal 
authorities, but is non-local and provided by the Federal govern- 
ment, is the Polytechnikum at Zurich. In all the important 
towns of the Federation there are trade and technical schools 
of a more or less special character, adapted to the local indus- 
tries; e.g. schools for silk-weaving, wood-carving, watchmaking, 
or agriculture. But the Zurich Polytechnikum has a wider and 
more comprehensive range of work. It is a college designed 
to give instruction and practical training in those sciences which 
stand in the closest relation to manufactures and commerce 
and to skilled industry in general and its work is of university 
rank. 

To the English public the word polytechnic has only recently 
become familiar, in connexion with some London institutions of 
an exceptional character. In the reign of William The First 
IV. there was an institution in London called after Polytechnics 
the name of his consort— " The Adelaide Gallery " *** England. 
— and devoted rather to the display of new scientific inven- 
tions and curiosities than to research or to the teaching of 
science. It enjoyed an ephemeral popularity, and was soon 
imitated by an institution called the Polytechnic in Regent 
Street, with a somewhat more pretentious programme, a diving- 
bell, electrical and mechanical apparatus, besides occasional 
illustrated lectures of a popular and more or less recreative 
character. In the popular mind this institution is inseparably 
associated with " Professor " Pepper, the author of The Boy's 
Playbook of Science and of Pepper's Ghost. Both of these 
institutions, after a few years of success, failed financially; and 
in 1880 Mr Quintin Hogg, an active and generous philan- 
thropist, purchased the disused building in Regent Street, and 
reopened it on an altered basis, though still retaining the name 
of Polytechnic, to which, however, he gave a new significance. 
He had during sixteen years been singularly successful in 
gathering -together young shopmen and artisans in London in 
the evenings and on Sunday for religious and social intercourse, 
and in acquiring their confidence. But by rapid degrees his 
enterprise, which began as an evangelistic effort, developed into 
an educational institution of a novel and comprehensive char- 
acter, with classes for the serious study of science, art, and 
literature, a gymnasium, library, reading circles, laboratories 
for physics and chemistry, conversation and debating clubs, 
organized country excursions, swimming, rowing, and natural 
history societies, a savings bank, and choral singing, besides 
religious services, open to all the members, though not obli- 
gatory for any. The founder, who from the first took the 
closest personal interest in the students, well describes his own 
aims: " What we wanted to develop our institute into was a 
place which should recognize that God had given man more than 
one side to his character, and where we could gratify any reason- 
able taste, whether athletic, intellectual, spiritual or social. 
The success of this effort was remarkable. In the first winter

6S00 members joined, paying fees of 3s. per term, or 10s. 6d. per

reached a total of 15,000 The average daily attendance is 
4000; six hundred classes in different grades and subjects are 
held weekly; and upwards of forty clubs and societies have been 
formed in connexion with the recreative and social departments. 
The precedent thus established by private initiative has since 

rbeen followed in the formation of the public institutions which, 
Later under the name of " Polytechnics," have become 

institutions so prominent and have exercised such beneficent 
of this influence among the working population of London. 
Class. * j<he principal resources for the foundation and 
maintenance of these institutions have been derived from two 
funds — that administered under the City Parochial Charities 
Act of 1883, and that furnished by the London County Council, 
at first under the terms of the Local Taxation (Customs and 
Excise) Act of 1890, and the Technical Instruction Act 1889, 
but since the 1st of May 1904 under the Education Act 1902, 
as applied to London by the act of 1903. More detailed refer- 
ence to these two acts seems to be necessary in this place. 

The royal commission of inquiry into the parochial char- 
ities of London was appointed in 1878, mainly at the instance 
The city °* ^ r J ames Bryce, and under the presidency of 
Parochial the Duke of Northumberland. Its report appeared 
Charities \ n 1880, giving particulars of the income of the 
AcL parishes, and revealing the fact that the funds had 

largely outgrown the original purposes of the endowments, 
which were ill adapted to the modern needs of the class for 
rvhose benefit they were intended. The act of parliament of 
1883 was designed to give effect to the recommendations of 
the commissioners. It provided that while five of the largest 
parishes were to retain the management of their own charitable 
funds, the endowments of the remaining 107 parishes in the 
city should be administered by a corporate body, to be en- 
titled " the Trustees of the London Parochial Charities" (other- 
wise known in relation to the polytechnics as " the Central 
Governing Body"), this body to include five nominees of the 
Crown and four of the corporation of London. The remaining 
members were to be chosen under a subsequent scheme of the 
charity commission, which added four nominees of the Lon- 
don County Council, two of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, 
and one each appointed by the university of London, Univer- 
sity College, King's College, the City and Guilds institute, and 
the governing bodies of the Bishopsgate and the Cripplegate 
foundations. For the purpose of framing the scheme, a special 
commissioner, Mr James Anstie, Q.C., was temporarily attached 
to the charity commission, and it thus became the duty of the 
commission to prepare a statement of the charity property 
possessed by the 107 parishes, distinguishing between the secular 
and the ecclesiastical parts of the endowments. The annual 
income derived from the ecclesiastical fund was £35,000, and 
that from the secular portion of the fund £50,000. The 
scheme assigned capital grants amounting to £155,000 to the 
provision of open spaces, and £149,500 to various institutions, 
including free libraries in Bishopsgate and Cripplegate, the 
People's Palace, the Regent Street and Northampton Institutes, 
and the Victoria Hall. A capital sum of £49,355 out of the 
ecclesiastical fund was devoted to the repair of city churches; 
and the balance of the annual income of this fund, after 
allowances for certain vested interests, was directed to be paid 
to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. This balance has varied by 
slight increases from year to year, and amounted in 1906 to 
£20,875. The remaining fund thus set free for secular purposes 
was by the scheme largely devoted to the erection and main- 
tenance of polytechnic institutions, or " industrial institutes," 
as they were at first called. It was the opinion of Mr Anstie 
and his fellow-commissioners that in this way it would be possible 
to meet one of the most urgent of the intellectual needs of the 
metropolis, and to render service nearly akin to the original 
purposes of the obsolete charitable endowments. For the year 
1 906-1907 the grants made to the polytechnics and kindred 
institutions (the Working Men's College, College for Working 



Women, &c.) by the Central Governing Body amounted to 
£39,140, and the total amount contributed by the Central 
Governing Body since its creation amounts to £543,000. 

The general scope and aims of the institutions thus con- 
templated by the commissioners are defined in the A f ypicaJ 
" general regulations for the management of an indus- Scheme 
trial institute," which are appended as a schedule to under the 
the several schemes, and which run as follows: — Act * 

The object of this institution is the promotion of the industrial 
skill, general knowledge, health and well-being of young men and 
women belonging to the poorer classes by the following means: — 
_ i. Instruction in — 

a. The general rules and principles of the arts and sciences 

applicable to any handicraft, trade or business. 

b. The practical application of such general rules and 

principles in any handicraft, trade or business. 

c. Branches or details of any handicraft, trade or business, 

facilities for acquiring the knowledge of which cannot 
usually be obtained in the workshop or other place 
of business. 

The classes and lectures shall not be designed or arranged so as 
to be in substitution for the practical experience of the workshop 
or place of business, but so as to be supplementary thereto. 

h. Instruction suitable for persons intending to emigrate. 

iii. Instruction in such other branches and subjects of art, 
science, language, literature and general knowledge as may be 
approved by the governing body. 

iv. Public lectures or courses of lectures, musical and other 
entertainments and exhibitions. 

v. Instruction and practice in gymnastics, drill, swimming and 
other bodily exercises. 

vi. Facilities for the formation and meeting of clubs and societies. 

vii. A library, museum and reading room or rooms. 

Within the limits prescribed, the governing body may from time 
to time, out of the funds at their disposal, provide and maintain 
buildings and grounds, including workshops and laboratories suit- 
able for all the purposes herein specified, and the necessary furniture, 
fittings, apparatus, models and books, and may provide or receive 
by gift or on loan works of art or scientific construction, or objects 
of interest .and curiosity, for the purpose of the institute, and for 
the purpose of temporary exhibition. 

Other provisions in the scheme require: (1) that the educa- 
tional benefits of the institute shall be available for both sexes 
equally, but that common rooms, refreshment rooms, gymnasia 
and swimming-baths may be established separately, under such 
suitable arrangements as may be approved by the governing 
body; (2) that the fees and subscriptions shall be so fixed as to 
place the benefits of the institute within the reach of the poorer 
classes; (3) that no intoxicating liquors, smoking or gambling 
shall be allowed in any part of the building; (4) that the build- 
ings, ground and premises shall not be used for any political, 
denominational or sectarian purpose, although this rule shall 
not be deemed to prohibit the discussion of political subjects 
in any debating society approved by the governing body; (5) 
that no person under the age of sixteen or above twenty-five 
shall be admitted to membership except on special grounds, 
and that the number thus specially admitted shall not exceed 
5 % of the total number of members. 

These and the like provisions have formed the common basis 
for all the metropolitan polytechnics. In 1800 a large sum 
was placed by the Local Taxation (Customs and 
Excise) Act at the disposal of the county and county n jc^t^ an j 
borough councils for the general purposes of tech- of the 
nical education, and in 1893 the London County London 
Council determined to devote a considerable portion *£^ u n B % u 
of this revenue to the further development and sus- 
tentation of polytechnics. While the funds granted by the 
Central Governing Body may be employed in aid of the social 
and recreative as well as the educational purposes of the 
various institutes, it is a statutory obligation that the sums 
contributed by the London County Council should be applied 
to educational work only. 

Dr William Garnett, the educational adviser of the London 
County Council, has, in a published lecture delivered before 
the international congress on technical education in June 
1897, thus described the conditions under which the council 
offers financial help to the London polytechnics: — 



4° 



POLYTECHNIC 



The objects which the technical education board has had in 
view in its dealings with the polytechnics have been : — 

i. To allow to the several governing bodies the greatest possible 
freedom in the conduct of social, recreative and even religious 
work within the provisions of the schemes of the Charity Com- 
missioners. 

2. To secure to each polytechnic the services of an educational 
principal, who should be responsible to his governing body for 
the organization and conduct of the whole of the work of the 
institution. 

3. To provide in each polytechnic a permanent staff of teachers, 
who should be heads ot their respective departments and give 
their whole time to the work of the institution, and thus to 
establish a corporate or collegiate life in the polytechnic. 

4. To ensure that all branches of experimental science are taught 
experimentally, and that the students have the opportunity of 
carrying out practical laboratory work, at an inclusive fee not 
exceeding ten shillings for any one subject. 

5. To provide efficient workshop instruction in all practical trade 
subjects. 

6. To secure that the number of students under the charge of 
any one teacher in laboratory or workshop classes, or in other 
classes in which personal supervision is of paramount importance, 
shall not exceed a stated limit (fifteen in the workshop, or twenty 
in the laboratory). 

7. To exclude from classes students who, for want of preliminary 
training, are incapable of profiting by the instruction provided; 
and to this end to restrict the attendance at workshop classes to 
those who arc actually engaged in the trades concerned, and have 
thus opportunities of acquiring the necessary manual dexterity in 
the performance of their daily duties. 

8. To furnish an adequate fixed stipend for all teachers, in place 
of a contingent interest in fees and grants. 

9. To encourage private subscriptions and donations. 

10. To establish an efficient system of inspection. ^ * 

11. To facilitate the advertisement of polytechnic^ classes, and 
especially to invite the co-operation of trade societies in supporting 
their respective classes. 

12. To encourage the higher development of some special branch 
of study in each polytechnic. 

13. To utilize the polytechnic buildings as far as possible in the 
daytime by the establishment of technical day schools, or otherwise. 

14. To secure uniformity in the keeping of accounts. 

The regulations under which the council has 
attempted to secure its objects by means of 
grants have been changed from time to time as 
the work of the polytechnics has developed, 
but they provide that the council's aid should 
be partly in the form of a fixed grant to each 
institution, partly a share of the salaries of the 
principal and the permanent teachers, partly 
a grant on attendance, the scale depending on 
the subject and character of the instruction, and 
partly a subsidy (15%) on voluntary contri- 
butions. In addition to the annual grants for 
maintenance, substantial grants for building 
and equipment are made from time to time. 

The scale of grants adopted by the council for the 
session 1907-1908 was the following: — 

i. A fixed grant assigned to each polytechnic. 

ii. Three-fourths of the salary of the principal 
(subject to certain conditions). 

iii. Fifty per cent, of the salaries of heads of approved 
departments. 

iv. Ten per cent, of the salaries of other teachers. 

v. Fifteen per cent, on (voluntary) annual subscriptions or 
donations. 

vi. Attendance grants on evening classes varying from id. to 
6d. per student-hour (subject to certain conditions of minimum 
attendance, eligibility, &c). 

vii. Special grants not exceeding £50 for courses of lectures on 
particular subjects required or approved by the council. 

viii. Special grants towards any departments which the council 
may desire to see established or maintained. 

ix. Equipment grants and building grants in accordance with 
the special requirements of the institutions. 

The above grants are independent of any contributions which 
the council may make towards secondary day schools or day 
schools of domestic economy or training colleges ofdomestic economy 
in the polytechnics. 

With a view to a due division of labour, and also to the co- 
operation of the public bodies concerned, the "London Poly- 
technic Council" was created in 1894. It was composed of 



representatives of the Central Governing Body, the technical 
education board of the London County Council, and the 
City and Guilds of London Institute, and its duty was to consult 
as to the appropriation of funds, the organiza- London 
'tion of teaching, the holding of needful examina- Polytechnic 
tions, and the supervision of the work generally. Councn * 
After ten years of work the London polytechnic council 
was dissolved in the summer of 1904 in consequence of the 
abolition of the technical education board of the London 
County Council, when the council became responsible for all 
grades of education. A statement below shows the number 
and names of the several institutions, and the extent to which 
they have been severally aided by the Central Governing Body 
and the London County Council. 

The " People's Palace" owes its origin in part to the popu- 
larity of a novel by Sir Walter Besant, entitled All Sorts and 
Conditions of Men, in which the writer pointed out The 
the sore need of the inhabitants of East London People's 
for social improvement and healthy recreation, Palace * 
and set forth an imaginary picture of a " Palace of Delight," 
wherein this need might be partly satisfied. Much public 
interest was awakened, large subscriptions were given, and 
the Central Governing Body aided the project; but the 
munificence of the drapers' company in setting aside £7000 a 
year for its permanent maintenance released the London County 
Council from any obligation to make a grant. Apart from the 
social and recreative side of this popular institution, the edu- 
cational section, under the name of the East London Technical 
College, steadily increased in numbers and influence under the 
fostering care of the drapers' company and has now been re- 
cognized as a "school" of the university of London under 
the title of " The East London College" and is being utilized 
by the London County Council in the same way as other " schools 
of the university."

In the above table the grants are given to the nearest pound. 
Up to July 1907 the total expenditure of the council upon the 
polytechnics, apart from the day schools, training colleges, &c, 
conducted in them, was about £525,000, almost exactly the 
same as that of the Central Governing Body. The voluntary 
grants from the central governing body include a contribution 
towards a compassionate fund, and a pension fund based on 
endowment assurances for all permanent officers of the poly- 
technics in receipt of salaries of not less than £100 a year. 

The grants received from the board of education amount 
to about £30,000 a year, while the fees of students and members 
produce about £45,000. Voluntary subscriptions, including 
those from city companies and other sources of income, pro- 
duce about £30,000 in addition, so that out of a total expendi- 
ture of about £200,000 a year the council now contributes 30%, 
the Central Governing Body 18%, fees 22^%, the board 
of education 15% and city companies and other subscribers 
15%

The Goldsmiths' Institute at New Cross owed its existence 
and its annual maintenance to the generous initiative of the 
ancient city gild whose name it bore. It was therefore entirely 
independent ot pecuniary subsidy from any other public body. 
In the year 1900 the number of class entries to this institute 
was 7574. In 1904 the goldsmiths' company presented the 
premises, together with an annual subsidy, to the university of 
London for the purposes of a training college for teachers, so 
that from that date it ceased to be one of the London poly- 
technics, although, pending the provision of other premises, many 
of the technical evening classes have been continued under 
the London County Council by permission of the university 
with the approval of the company. The clothworkers' com- 
pany has also contributed £18,000 to the Northern Polytechnic 
at Holloway. 

In all these institutions the general aims have been practically 
the same, although special features have been differentiated 
Aims and in order to meet the local needs and the wishes of 
Methods, the inhabitants. In all' there are laboratories and 
lecture rooms, trade classes, art studios, gymnasia, provision 
for manual training and domestic economy and applied science. 
In nearly all, at first, mechanical and manual instruction 
were the prominent objects in view, partly owing to the 
conditions under which grants were made by the science 
and art department. But of late increased attention has been 
paid year by year to literary and humaner studies, and to 
general mental cultivation, pursued pari passu with technical 
and scientific training. The aid of the London organization for 
university extension, now a department of the university, 
has been especially serviceable in providing courses of lectures 
and classes in literary subjects at nearly all the polytechnics. 
As subsidiary to their main work, some of them have estab- 
lished junior continuation schools, with a view to provide 
suitable instruction for scholars who have left the public ele- 
mentary schools and are not yet prepared to enter the technical 
and trade classes. Although the workshops and the classes for 
artisans are used chiefly in the evenings, there is an increasing 
number of day students : e.g. at the Northampton Polytechnic 
Institute in Clerkenwell there is a very important day school 
of engineering conducted on the "sandwich system, " the 
students entering engineering works for the summer months 
and returning to the polytechnic for the winter session; at the 
Battersea Polytechnic there is a very important training col- 
lege for teachers of domestic economy; at Regent Street there 
are day schools in engineering, architecture, photo-process and 
carriage-building; at the South-Western Polytechnic there are 
important schools of mechanical and electrical engineering and 
a training college for women teachers of physical exercises; 
at the Northern Polytechnic, as at Battersea, there is a training 
college for teachers of domestic economy, and there are 
departments of commerce and of physics and chemistry, while 
the Woolwich Polytechnic receives in the daytime, by special 
arrangement with the war office, a large number of engineering 
apprentices employed in the arsenal. In short, the schemes of 
the several institutions are so elastic that the governing bodies 
are at liberty to open any classes or to try any educational or 
recreative experiment for which they can find a genuine local 
demand. The total number of scholars in the polytechnics 
and their branch institutions is variously estimated at from 
40,000 to 50,000, and the total number of regular scholars in the 
evening schools of the council does not exceed 100,000. These 
figures may be usefully compared with the census returns, 
which show that within the metropolitan area there are 
704,414 persons between the ages of thirteen and twenty- 
one. It is a noteworthy fact that, whereas in the population 
statistics for the whole of England and Wales the number 
at: each year of age is regularly diminished by death from 
eight years onwards, there is a steady increase in London, 
year by year, from fourteen up to the age of thirty. This fact 
is owing to the constant immigration of young men and women 
from the provinces to the metropolis. The census commis- 
sioners in their report for 1901 (p. 15) computed that more than 



one-third of the population of London were not natives. They 
show also that, if all England and Wales be taken together, 
the number of persons between twenty and twenty-one is less 
by 12-8% than the number between thirteen and fourteen; 
but that, taking London alone, the number of persons between 
twenty and twenty-one is greater by 14-4% than the number 
between thirteen and fourteen. Hence, the proportion of the 
inhabitants who are of an age to benefit by polytechnics and 
continuation schools is in London exceptionally large. It 
would not be right for Londoners to complain that there is thus 
cast upon them the duty of providing suitable instruction for so 
many immigrants, for if the great city drains the rural districts 
of some of their best brain and muscle, she gains much from 
their industry and productive power. The figures, however, 
point to the necessity for taking every means possible to 
raise the standard, both physical and intellectual, of the 
London boy. The immigration into London of youths and 
young men means to a great extent the substitution of the 
provincially trained improver or artisan for the less fit London 
boy, who consequently falls into the ranks of the unskilled, 
then of the unemployed and ultimately of the unemployable. 

But it follows from the particulars thus given that neither 
the supply of suitable provision for mental improvement and 
rational recreation for the wage-earning classes, nor the demand 
for such provision on the part of the workers themselves is 
commensurate with the moral and intellectual needs of a com- 
munity of nearly seven millions of people (four and a half 
millions within the administrative county). The provision in 
evening schools, institutes, classes and polytechnics is still in 
some respects far inferior to that which is to be found in most 
German and Swiss towns, and needs to be greatly increased. 
In matters relating to the higher life, demand does not always 
precede supply; it is simply which is needed not only to satisfy 
the public demand, but to create it. As new and well-devised 
opportunities for mental culture are placed within reach, 
they will be more and more appreciated, new and healthier 
appetites will be stimulated, the art of employing leisure 
wisely and happily will be more systematically studied, and the 
polytechnics will become still more important centres of 
civilizing and educating influence than they have hitherto 
been. 

In particular, the reconstituted university of London has 
been placed in new and most helpful relation to the best of the 
polytechnics. By the statutes the senate of the university is 
empowered to include in the list of " schools of the university " 
all institutions which are duly equipped and able to furnish 
suitable instruction of an advanced and scholarly type; and 
also to recognize all thoroughly qualified professors in their 
several faculties and subjects as " teachers of the university," 
although some of their' classes may meet in the evening only, 
and no student is to be prevented from taking a degree as an 
internal student of the university solely because he can attend 
classes only in the evening. There is thus a way open for the 
due recognition of the polytechnics as part of the teaching 
machinery of the university, and for the admission of the best 
students as undergraduates, with all the rights of internal 
students. The great possibilities of the metropolitan univer- 
sity under its new conditions were at first hardly revealed or 
accurately foreseen. But there were during the session 1906-1907 
no less than eighty-six recognized " teachers of the university " 
on the staffs of the London polytechnics and more than 750 
students who were working for London University degrees 
in the polytechnic classes. There is no reason to fear that 
the recreative, social, manual and industrial training, to which 
at first the special attention of the founder of the Regent Street 
Polytechnic was directed, will suffer from a fuller expansion 
of the academic and literary side of " polytechnic " life. Rather 
it may be hoped that the due co-ordination of the practical with 
the purely intellectual purposes of these institutions will serve 
to give to all the students, whatever their future destination 
may be, a truer and broader conception of the value of mental 
culture for its own sake.

POLYXENA— POLYZOA 



See also a paper by Mr Sidney Webb, The London Polytechnic 
Institutes, in the second volume of special reports on educational 
subjects (1898) issued by the Education Department; the Report 
of the Central Governing Body of the London Parochial Charities; 
the Annual Reports of the London County Council; the Polytechnic 
Magazine, published From time to time at the institute in Regent 
Street; and various memoirs and papers contained in the Proceed- 
ings of the International Congress on Technical Education (1897), 
especially two — that by Mr Quintin Hogg, detailing his own early 
experience in founding the first polytechnic, and that of Dr William 
Garnett, then secretary of the Technical Education Board. 

(J.G.F.;W.G.) 
POLYXENA, in Greek legend, daughter of Priam, king of 
Troy, and Hecuba. She had been betrothed to Achilles, who 
was slain by Paris in the temple of Apollo Thymbraeus, where 
the marriage was to have been celebrated (Hyginus, Fab. no). 
The shade of Achilles afterwards appeared to the returning 
Greeks in the Thracian Chersonese and demanded the sacrifice 
of Polyxena, who was put to death by Neoptolemus, son of 
Achilles, on his father's grave (Ovid, Metam. xiii. 440 sqq.). 
The tragic story is the subject of the Hecuba of Euripides, the 
Troades of Seneca and the Polyxena of Sophocles, of which only 
a few fragments remain. According to Philostratus {Heroica, 
20, 18), Polyxena fled to the Greeks after the murder of Achilles 
and^committed suicide on his tomb. 

POLYZOA, in zoology, a term (introduced by J. V. Thompson, 
1830) synonymous with Bryozoa (Ehrenberg, 183 1) for a group 
commonly included with the Brachiopoda in the Molluscoidea 
(Milne Edwards, 1843). The correctness of this association is 
questionable, and the Polyzoa are here treated as a primary 
division or phylum of the animal kingdom. They may be 
defined as aquatic animals, forming colonies by budding; with 
ciliated retractile tentacles and a U-shaped alimentary canal. 
The phylum is subdivided as follows. 

Class I. Entoprocta (Nitsche). Lophophore circular, in- 
cluding both mouth and anus. Tentacles infolded, during 
retraction, into a vestibule which can be 
closed by a sphincter. Body-wall not 
calcified, body-cavity absent.- Definite 
excretory organs present. Reproductive 
organs with ducts leading to the vesti- 
bule. Zooids possessing a high degree 
of individuality. Loxosoma Pediccllina 
(fig. 1), Unialella. 

Class II. Ectoprocta (Nitsche). 
Lophophore circular or horseshoe 
shaped, including the mouth but not 
the anus. Tentacles retractile into an 
introvert (" tentacle-sheath "). Body- 
wall membranous or calcified, body- 
cavity distinct. Specific excretory 
organs absent, with the doubtful excep- 
tion of the Phylactolaemata. Repro- 
ductive organs not continuous with ducts. 
Zooids usually connected laterally with 
their neighbours. 

Order 1. Gymnolaemata (All man). — 
Lophophore circular, with no epistome. 
Fig. 1. — Part of the Body-cavities of zooids not continuous 
creeping stolon, with with one another. Body-wall not muscular, 
zooids, of Pedicellina Sub-order 1. Trepostomata (Ulrich);

Hatschek (1888) treated the Entoprocta as a division of his 
group Scolecida, characterized by the possession of a primary 
body-cavity and of protonephridia; while he placed the Ecto- 
procta, with the Phoronida and Brachiopoda, in a distinct group, 
the Tentaculata. Against this view may be urged the essential 
similarity between the processes of budding in Entoprocta and 
Ectoprocta (cf. Seeliger, Zeitschr. wiss. Z00L xlix. 168; 1., 560), 
and the resemblances in the development of the two classes. 

Of the forms above indicated there is no palaeontological evidence 
with regard to the Entoprocta. The Trepostomata are in the 
main Palaeozoic, although Heteropora, of which recent species exist, 
is placed by Gregory in this division. The Cryptostomata are also 
Palaeozoic, and include the abundant and widely-distributed 
genus FenesteUa. The Cyclostomata are numerous in Palaeozoic 
rocks, but attained a specially predominant position in the Creta- 
ceous strata, where they are represented by a profusion of genera 
and species; while they still survive in considerable numbers at 
the present day. The Ctenostomata are ill adapted for preserva- 
tion as fossils, though remains referred to this group have been

described from Palaeozoic strata. They constitute a small proportion 
of the recent Polyzoa. The Cheilostomata arc usually believed to 
have made their appearance in the Jurassic period. They are the 
dominant group at the present day, and 
are represented by a large number of 
genera and species. The Pnylactolaemata 
are a small group confined to fresh water, 
and possess clear indications of adaptation 
to that habitat. The fresh-water fauna 
also contains a representative of the 
Entoprocta (Urnatella), two or three 
Ctenostoraes, such as Victorella and Palu- 
dicella, and one or two species of Cheilo- 
stomata. With these exceptions, the 
existing Polyzoa are marine forms, occur- 
ring from between tide-marks to abyssal 
depths in the ocean. 

The Polyzoa are colonial animals, the 
colony (zoarium) originating in most 
cases from a free-swimming larva, which 
attaches itself to some solid object and 
becomes metamorphosed into the primary 
individual, or ancestrula." In the 
Pnylactolaemata, however, a new colony 
may originate not only from a larva, but 
also from a peculiar form of bud known 
as a statoblast, or by the fission of a 
fully-developed colony. The ancestrula 
inaugurates a process of budding, con- 
of tinued by its progeny, and thus gives 
rise to the mature colony. In Loxosoma 
the buds break off as soon as they become 
mature, and a colonial form is thus hardly 
br, Tentacles, arranged assumed. In other Entoprocta the buds 
a horseshoe retain a high degree of individuality, a 
thread-like stolon giving off the cylindrical 
stalks, each of which dilates at its end 
into the body of a zooid. In some of the 
Ctenostomata the colony is similarly 
constituted, a branched stolon giving 
off the zooids, which are not connected with one another. In 
the majority of Ectoprocta there is no stolon, the zooids growing 
out of one another and being usually apposed so as to form con- 
tinuous sheets or branches. In the encrusting type, which is 
found in a large proportion^ of the genera, the zooids are usually 
in a single layer, with their orifices facing away from the sub- 
stratum; but in certain species the colony becomes multilaminar 
by the continued superposition of new zooids over the free surfaces 
of the older ones, whose orifices they naturally occlude. The 
zoarium may rise up into erect growths composed of a single layer 
of zooids, the orifices of which are all on one surface, or of two layers 
of zooids placed back to back, with the orifices on both sides of 
the fronds or plates. The rigid Cheilostomes which have this 
habit were formerly placed in the genus Eschara, but the bilaminar 
type is common to a number of genera, and there can be no doubt 
that it is not in itself an indication of affinity. The body- wall is 
extensively calcified in the Cyclostomata and in most Cheilo- 
stomata, which may form elegant network-like colonies, as in the 
unilaminar genus Retepora, or may consist of wavy anastomosing 
plates, as in the bilaminar Lepralia foltacea of the British coasts, 
specimens of which may have a diameter^ of many inches. In 
other Cheilostomes the amount of calcification may be much less, 
the supporting skeleton being largely composed of the organic 
material chitin. In Flustra and other forms belonging to this 
type, the zoarium is accordingly flexible, and either bilaminar 
or unilaminar. In many calcareous forms, both Cheilostomesand 
Cyclostomes, the zoarium is rendered flexible by the interposition 
of chitinous joints at intervals. This habit is characteristic of the 
genera Crista, Ccllaria, Catenicella and others, while it occurs in 
certain species of other genera. The form of the colony may thus 
be a good generic character, or, on the contrary, a single genus or 
even species may assume a variety of different forms. While 
nearly all Polyzoa are permanently fixed to one spot, the colonies 
of Cristatella and Lophopus among the Pnylactolaemata can crawl 
slowly from place to place. 

Anatomy. — The zooids of which the colonies of Ectoprocta are 
composed consist of two parts: the body- wall and the visceral 
mass (figs. 6, 9). These were at one time believed to represent 
two individuals of different kinds, together constituting a zooid. 
The visceral mass was accordingly termed the " polypide " and 
the body-wall which contains it the " zooecium.'* This view 
depended principally on the fact that the life of the polypide and 
of the zooecium are not coextensive. It is one of the most re- 
markable facts in the natural history of the Polyzoa that a single 
zooecium may be tenanted by several polypides, which successively 
degenerate. The periodical histolysis may be partly due to the 
absence of specific excretory organs and to the accumulation of 
pigmented excretory substances in the wall of the alimentary 
canal. On the degeneration of the polypide, its nutritive material 
is apparently absorbed for the benefit of the zooid, while the pig- 



mented substances assume a spheroidal form, which either remains 
as an inert " brown body " in the body-cavity or is discharged to 
the exterior by the alimentary canal of the new polypide. This 
is formed as a two-layered " polypide-bud," which usually develops 
from the inner side of the zooecial wall, and soon occupies the place 
of the previous polypide. The inner layer of the polypide-bud 
gives rise to the structures usually regarded as ectodermic and 
endodermic, the outer layer to the mesodermic organs. 

The polypide consists of a " lophophore " bearing a series of 
ciliated tentacles by which Diatoms and other microscopic bodies 
are collected as food, of a U-shaped alimentary canal, and of a 
central nervous system. While the mouth is invariably encircled 
by the bases of the tentacles, the anus lies within the series in the 
Entoprocta and outside it in the Ectoprocta. The lophophore is 
a simple circle in all Polyzoa except in the Pnylactolaemata, where 
it typically has the form of a horse shoe outlined by the bases of 
the tentacles. In Fredericella belonging to this order it is, however, 
circular, but the systematic position of the genus is sufficiently 
indicated by its possession of an " epistome," a lip-like structure 
guarding the anal side of the mouth in all Pnylactolaemata and 
absent throughout the Gymnolaemata. The cavities of the hollow 
tentacles open into a circular canal which surrounds the oesophagus 
at the base of the lophophore. This is continuous with the general 
body-cavity in the Pnylactolaemata, while in the Gymnolaemata 
it develops in the bud as a part of the body-cavity, from which 
it becomes completely separated. In the Entoprocta the tentacles 
are withdrawn by being infolded into the " vestibule," a depression 
of the oral surface which can be closed by a sphincter muscle. In 
the Ectoprocta they are retractile into an introvert, the " tentacle- 
sheath " (fig. 9), the external opening of which is the " orifice " of 
the zooecium. In the Cyclostomata, further distinguished by the 
cylindrical or prismatic form of their highly calcified zooecia, the 
orifice is typically circular, without any definite closing organ. 
In the Cheilostomata it is closed by a chitinous (rarely calcareous) 
" operculum " (fig. 9, C), while in the Ctenostomata it is guarded 
by a delicate membrane similar to a piece of paper rolled into a 
longitudinally creased cylinder. During retraction this " collar " 
lies concealed in the beginning of the introvert. It becomes visible 
when the polypide begins to 
protrude its tentacles, making 
its appearance, through the 
orifice as a delicate hyaline 
frill through which the ten- 
tacles are pushed. 

In the Pnylactolaemata the 
outermost layer of the body- 
wall is a flexible, uncalcified 
cuticle or " ectocyst," be- 
neath which follow in suc- 
cession the ectoderm, the 
muscular layers and the 
coelomic epithelium. In a 
few Gymnolaemata the ec- 
tocyst is merely chitinous, 
although in most cases the 
four vertical walls and the 
basal wall of the zooecium 
are calcareous. The free 
(frontal) wall may remain 
membranous and uncalcified, 
as in Membranipora (figs. 
8 A, 9 A), but in many 
Cheilostomes the frontal 
surface is protectee^ by a cal- 
careous shield, which grows 
from near the free edges of 
the vertical walls and com- 
monly increases in thickness 
as the zooecium grows older 
by the activity of the " epi- 
theca," a layer of living 
tissue outside it. # The* body- 
wall is greatly simplified in 
the Gymnolaemata, in cor- 
relation with the functional 
importance of the skeletal 
part of the wall. Even the 
ectoderm can rarely be recog- 
nized as an obvious epithe- 
lium except in regions where 
budding is taking place, while 
muscular layers are always 
absent and a coelomic epi- 
thelium can seldom be ob- 
served. The body-cavity is, 
however, traversed by mus- 
cles, and by strands of meso- 
dermic " funicular tissue,"

through perforated " rosette-plates " in the dividing walls. In 
the Phylactolaemata a single definite funiculus passes from the body- 
wall to the apex of the stomach. This latter organ is pigmented 
in all Polyzoa, and is produced, in the Ectoprocta, beyond the 
point where the intestine leaves it into a conspicuous caecum 
(fig. 6, v). The nervous system is represented by a ganglion 
situated between the mouth and the anus. The ovary (o) and 
the testis (t) of Ectoprocta are developed on the body-wall, on the 
stomach, or on the funiculus. Both kinds of reproductive organs 
may occur in a single zooecium, and the reproductive, elements pass 
when ripe into the body-cavity. Their mode of escape is unknown 
in most cases. In some Gymnolaemata, polypides which develop 
an ovary possess a flask-shaped " intertentacular organ/' situated 
between two of the tentacles, and affording a direct passage into the 
introvert for the eggs or even the spermatozoa developed in the same 
zooecium. In other cases the reproductive cells perhaps pass out by 
the atrophy of the polypide, whereby the body-cavity may become 
continuous with the exterior. The statoblasts of the Phylactolaemata 
originate on the funiculus, and are said to be derived partly from an 
ectodermic core possessed by this organ and partly from its external 
mesoderm (Braem), the former giving rise to the chitinous envelope 
and to a nucleated layer (fig. 7, ect), which later invaginates to form 
the inner vesicle of the polypide-bud. The mesodermic portion 
becomes charged with a yolk-like material (v), and, on the germina- 
tion of the statoblast, gives rise to the outer layer (mes) of the bud. 
The production of a polypide by the statoblast thus differs in no 
essential respect from the formation of a polypide in an ordinary 
zooecium. The statoblasts require a period of rest before germina- 
tion, and Braem has shown that their property of floating at the 
surface may be beneficial to them by exposing them to the action 
mL of frost, which in some 

cases improves the ger- 
minating power. The 
occurrence of Phylac- 
tolaemata in the tropics 
would show, however, 
without further evidence, 
that frost is not a factor 
essential for germination. 
The withdrawal of the 
extended polypide is 
effected -by the contrac- 
tion • of the retractor 
muscles (fig. 6, wr), and 
must result in an in- 
crease in the volume of 
the contents of the body- 
cavity. The alternate 
increase and diminution 
of volume is easily under- 
stood in forms with flex- 
ible zooecia. Thus in the 
Phylactolaemata the con- 
traction of the muscular 
body-wall exerts a pressure on the fluid of the body-cavity and is 
the cause of the protrusion of the polypide. In the Gymno- 
laemata protrusion is effected by the contraction of the parietal 
muscles, which pass freely across the body-cavity from one part 
of t the body- wall to another. In the branching Ctcnostomcs the 
entire body-wall is flexible, so that the contraction of a parietal 
muscle acts equally on the two points with which it is connected. 
In encrusting Ctenostomes and in the Afembranipora-Yike Cheilo- 
stomes (figs. 8 A, 9 A) the free surface or frontal wall is the only 

one in which any consider- 
able amount of movement 
can take place. The parie- 
tal muscles (p.m.), which 
pass from the vertical walls 
to the frontal wall, thus 
act by depressing the latter 
and so exerting a pressure 
on the fluid of the body-

In its most fully-developed condition (fig. 9, C) the compensation- 
sac (c.s.) is a large cavity which lies beneath the calcified frontal 
wall and opens to the exterior at the proximal border of the oper- 
culum (fig. 10). It is joined to the rigid body-wall by numerous 
muscle-fibres, the contraction of which must exert a pressure on 
the fluid of the body-cavity, thereby protruding the polypide. 
The exchange of fluid in the sac may well have a respiratory signifi- 
cance, in addition to its object of facilitating the movements of 
the tentacles. 

The evolution of the arrangements for protruding the polypide 
seems to have proceeded along several distinct lines: (i.) In certain

are developed in the young zooecium, but they soon unite with one 
another laterally, leaving rows of pores along the sutural lines 
(fig. 10). The operculum retains its op 
continuity ^ with the frontal membrane 
(fig. 9, B) into which the parietal muscles 
are still inserted. As indications that 
the conditions described in Membranipora 
and Cribrilina are of special significance 
may be noted the fact that the ancestrula 
of many genera which have well-developed 
compensation-sacs in the rest of their 
zooecia is a Membranipora-Wke individual 
with a series of marginal calcareous spines, 
and the further fact that a considerable 
proportion of the Cretaceous Cheilos- 
tomes belong either to the Membrani- 
poridae or to the Cribrilinidae. (ii.) In 
Scrupocellaria, Menipea and Caberea a 
single, greatly dilated marginal spine, the 

11 scutum " or " fornix," may protect the , Vi ^., .}?.— zooecium

the frontal membrane and parietal the France to the 
muscles of the young zooecium are like compensation -sac on 
those of Membranipora, but they become the Proximal side of the 
covered by the growth, from the proximal operculum {op). 
and lateral sides, of a calcareous lamina covered externally 
by a soft^ membrane. The^ arrangement is perhaps derivable 
from a CribrilinaAike condition in which the outer layer of the 
spines has become membranous while the spines themselves are 
laterally united from the first, (iv.) In the Microporidae and 
Steganoporellidae the body-cavity becomes partially subdivided 
by a calcareous lamina ("cryptocyst," Jullien) which grows from 
the proximal and lateral sides in a plane parallel to the frontal 
membrane and not far below it. The parietal muscles are usually 
reduced to a single pair, which may pass through foramina 
("opesiules ") in the cryptocyst to reach their insertion. There is 
no compensation-sac in these families, (v.) Many of the Lepralioid 
forms offer special difficulties, but the calcareous layer of the frontal 
surface is probably a cryptocyst (as in fig. 9, C), the compensation- 
sac being developed round its distal border. The " epitheca " 
noticed above is in this case the persistent frontal membrane, 
(vi.) In Microporella the opening of the compensation-sac has 
become separated from the operculum by calcareous matter, and 
is known as the " median pore." Jullien believed that this pore 
opens into the tentacle-sheath, but it appears probable that it really 
communicates with the compensation-sac and not with the tentacle- 
sheath. The mechanism of protrusion in the Cyclostomata is a 
subject which requires further examination. 

The most singular of the external appendages found in the 
Polyzoa^ are the avicularia and vibracula of the Cheilostomata. 
The avicularium is so called from its resemblance, in its most 
highly differentiated condition, to the head of a bird. In Bugula, 
for instance, a calcareous avicularium of this type is attached by 
a narrow* neck to each zooecium. The avicularium can move as 
a whole by means of special muscles, and its chitinous lower iaw

or " mandible " can be opened and closed. It is regarded as a 
modified zooecium, the polypide of which has become vestigial, 
although it is commonly represented by a sense-organ, bearing 
tactile hairs, situated on what may be termed the palate. The 
operculum of the normal zooecium has become the mandible, 
while the occlusor muscles have become enormous. In the vibra- 
culum the part representing the zooecium is relatively smaller, 
and the mandible has become the " seta," an elongated chitinous 
lash which projects far beyond the zooecial portion of the structure. 
In Caberea, the vibracula are known to move synchronously, but 
co-ordination of this kind is otherwise unknown in the Polyzoa. 
The avicularia and vibracula give valuable aid to the systematic 
study of the Cheilostomata. In its least differentiated form the 
avicularium occupies the place of an ordinary zooecium (" vicarious 
avicularium "), from which it is distinguished by the greater 
development of the operculum and its muscles, while the polypide 
is normally not functional. Avicularia of this type occur in the 
common Flustra foliacea, in various species of Membranipora, and 
in particular in the Onychocellidae, a remarkable family common 
in the Cretaceous period and still existing. In the majority of 
Cheilostomes, the avicularia are, so to speak, forced out of the 
ordinary series of zooecia, with which they are rigidly connected. 
There arc comparatively few cases in which, as in Bugula, they are 
mounted on a movable joint. Although at first sight the arrange- 
ment of the avicularia in Cheilostomes appears to follow no general 
law some method is probably to be made out on closer study. 
They occur in particular in relation with the orifice of the zooecium, 
and with that of the compensation-sac. This delicate structure 
is frequently guarded by an avicularium at its entrance, while 
avicularia are also commonly found on either side of the operculum 
or in other positions close to that structure. It can hardly be doubted 
that the function of^ these avicularia is the protection of the ten- 
tacles and compensation-sac. The suggestion that they are concerned 
in feeding does not rest on any^ definite evidence, and is probably 
erroneous. But avicularia or vibracula may also occur in other 
places — on the backs of unilaminar erect forms, along the sutural 
lines of the zooecia and on their frontal surface. These are probably 
important in checking overgrowth by encrusting organisms, and 
in particular by preventing larvae from fixing on the zoarium. 
Vibracula are of less frequent occurrence than avicularia, with which 
they may coexist as in Scrupocellaria, where they occur on the 
backs of the unilaminar branches. In the so-called Selenariidae, 
probably an unnatural association of genera which have assumed 
a free discoidal form of zoarium, they may reach a very high degree 
of development, but Busk's suggestion that in this group they 
" may be subservient to locomotion " needs verification. 

Development and Affinities. — It is generally admitted that the 
larva of the Entoprocta (fig. Ii) has the structure of a Trocho- 

sphere. This appears to indicate 
that the Polyzoa are remotely 
allied to other phyla in which 
this type of larva prevails, and 
in particular to the Mollusca and 
Chaetopoda, as well as to the 
Rotifera, which are regarded as 
persistent Trochospheres. The 
praeoral portion (lower in fig. n) 
constitutes the greater part of 
the larva and contains most of 
the viscera. It is terminated by 
a well-developed < structure (fg) 
corresponding with the apical 
sense-organ of ordinary Trocho- 
spheres, and an excretory organ 
(nph) of the type familiar in 
these larvae occurs on the ventral 
side of the stomach. The central 
nervous system (x) is highly 
developed, and in Loxosoma bears 
a pair of eyes. The larva swims 
by a ring of cilia, which corre- 
sponds with the praeoral circlet 
of a Trochosphere. The oral 
surface, on which are situated 
the mouth (m) and anus (a), is 
relatively small. The apical sense- 
organ is used for temporary attach- 
ment to the maternal vestibule in 
which development takes place, 
but permanent fixation is effected 
by the oral surface. This is followed by the atrophy of many of the 
larval organs, including the brain, the sense-organ and the ciliated 
ring. The alimentary canal persists and revolves in the median 
plane through an angle of 180 , accompanied by part of the larval 
vestibule, the space formed by the retraction of the oral surface. 
The vestibule breaks through to the exterior, and the tentacles, 
which have been developed within it, are brought into relation 
with the external water.

pora pilosa, the pelagic larva is known as Cyphonautes, and it has 
a structure not unlike that of the larval Pedicellina. The principal 
differences are the complication of the ciliated band, the absence of 
the excretory organ, the great lateral compression of the body, 
the possession of a pair of shells protecting the sides, the presence 
of an organ known as a the " pyriform organ," and the occurrence 
of a sucker in a position corresponding with the depression seen 
between (m) and {a) in fig. n. Fixation takes place by means of 
this sucker, which is everted for the purpose, part of its epithelium 
becoming the basal ectoderm of the ancestrula. The pyriform 
organ has probably assisted the larva to find an appropriate place 
for fixation (cf. Kupelwieser, 18); but, like the alimentary canal 
and most of the other larval organs, it undergoes a process of histo- 
lysis, and the larva becomes the ancestrula, containing; the primary 
brown body derived from the purely larval organs. The polypide is 
formed, as in an ordinary zooecium after the loss of its polypide, 
from a polypide-bud. 

The Cyphonautes type has been shown by Prouho (24) to occur 
in two or three widely different species of Cheilostomata and Cteno- 
stomata in which the eggs are laid and develop in the external 
water. In most Ectoprocta, however, the development takes place 
internally or in an ovicell, and a considerable quantity of yolk is 
present. The alimentary canal, which may be represented by a 
vestigial structure, is accordingly^ not functional, and the larva 
does not become pelagic. A pyriform organ is present in most 
Gymnolaemata as well as the sucker by which fixation is effected. 
As in the case of Cyphonautes, the larval organs degenerate and 
the larva becomes the ancestrula from which a polypide is developed 
as a bud. In the Cyclostomata the primary embryo undergoes 
repeated fission without developing definite organs, and each of 
the numerous pieces so formed becomes a free larva, which possesses 
no alimentary canal. Finally, in the Phylactolaemata, the larva 
becomes an ancestrula before it is^ hatched, and one or several 
polypidcs may be present when fixation is effected. 

The development of the Ectoprocta is intelligible on the hypo- 
thesis that the Entoprocta form the starting-point of the series. 
On the view that the Phylactolaemata are nearly related to Phoronis 
(see Phoronidea), it is extremely difficult to draw any conclusions 
with regard to the significance of the facts of development. If the 
Phylactolaemata were evolved from the type of structure repre- 
sented by Phoronis or the Pterobranchia (q.v.), the Gymnolaemata 
should be a further modification of this type, and the comparative 
study of the embryology of the two orders would appear to be 
meaningless. It seems more natural to draw the conclusion that 
the resemblances of the Phylactolaemata to Phoronis are devoid 
of phylogenetic significance.

POMADE— POMEGRANATE 



POMADE, or Poiiatum, a scented ointment, used formerly 
for softening and beautifying the skin, as a lip-salve, &c, but 
now principally applied to the hair. It was made originally 
from the juice of apples (Lat. pomum), whence the name. 

POMANDER (from Fr. pomvie d'ambre, i.e. apple of amber), 
a ball made of perfumes, such as ambergris (whence the name), 
musk, civet, &c, and formerly worn or carried in a case, also 
known hy the same name, as a protection against infection in 
times of pestilence or merely as a useful article to modify bad 
smells. The globular cases which contained the " pomanders " 
were hung from a neck-chain or attached to the girdle, and were 
usually perforated and made of gold or silver. Sometimes they 
contained several partitions, in each of which was placed a 
different perfume. There is an early Spanish pomander set 
with emeralds, and a fine 16th-century one, dredged from the 
Thames, in the British Museum. 

POMBAL, SEBASTIAO JOSE DE CARVALHO E MELLO, 
Marquess of (1690-1782), Portuguese statesman, was horn 
at Soure near Pomba, on the 13th of May 1699. He was the 
son of Manoel de Carvalho e Athayde, a country gentleman 
(fidalgo) and of his wife D. Theresa Luiza de Mendonca e Mello. 
He studied law at Coimbra University, served for a short time 
as a private in the army, and afterwards lived the life of a man 
about town in Lisbon, sharing in the diversions of the " Mohocks " 
who then infested the streets. In 1733 he ahducted and married 
D. Theresa de Noronha, a widow belonging to one of the most 
distinguished families in Portugal. He then retired to Soure, 
where, on the recommendation of Cardinal de Motta, King John 
V. commissioned him to write a series of biographical studies. 
In 1739 he was sent as Portuguese amhassador to London, where 
he remained until 1745. He was then transferred to Vienna. 
His first wife having died on the 7th of January 1 739, he married, 
on the 1 8th of December 1745, Leonora Ernestine Daun, 
daughter of General Count Daun. In 1749 he was recalled to 
take up the post of secretary of state for foreign affairs and war. 
The appointment was ratified on the 3rd of August 1750, by King 
Joseph, who had succeeded John V. in that year. Carvalho's 
career from 1750 to 1777 is part of the history of Portugal. 
Though he came into power only in his 51st year, without 
previous administrative experience, he was able to reorganize 
Portuguese education, finance, the army and the navy. He also 
built up new industries, promoted the development of Brazil 
and Macao, and expelled the Jesuits. His complete ascendancy 
over the mind of King Joseph dates from the time of the great 
Lisbon earthquake (Nov. 1, 1755). Though the famous words 
" Bury the dead and feed the living " were probahly not spoken 
by him, they summarize his action at this time of calamity. 
In June 1759 his suppression of the so-called " Tavora plot " 
gained for him the title of count of Oeyras; and in September 
1770 he was made marquess of Pombal. His severe adminis- 
tration had made many enemies, and his life had been attempted 
in 1769. Soon after the death of King Joseph, in 1777, Pombal 
was dismissed from office; and he was only saved from impeach- 
ment by the death of his hitterest opponent, the queen-mother, 
Mariana Victoria, in January 1781. On the 16th of August a 
royal decree forbade him to reside within twenty leagues of the 
court. He died at Pombal on the 8th of May 1782.

POMEGRANATE. The pomegranate {Punka Granaium) is 
of exceptional interest by reason of its structure, its history, and 
its utility. It forms a tree of small stature, or a bush, with 
opposite or alternate, shining, lance-shaped leaves, from the 



axils of some of which proceed the hrilliant scarlet flowers. 
These are raised on a short stalk, and consist of a thick fleshy 
cylindrical or hell-shaped calyx-tube, with five to seven short 
lobes at the top. From the throat of the calyx proceed five to

seven roundish, crumpled, scarlet or crimson petals, and helow 
them very numerous slender stamens. The pistil consists of two 
rows of carpels placed one above another, both rows embedded 
in, and partially inseparate from, the inner surface of the calyx- 
tube. The styles are confluent into one slender column. The 
fruit, which usually attains the size of a large orange, consists

of a hard leathery rind, enclosing a quantity of pulp derived 
from the coats of the numerous seeds. This pulp, filled as it is 
with refreshing acid juice, constitutes the chief value of the tree. 
The more highly cultivated forms contain more of it than the 
wild or half-mid varieties. The great structural peculiarity 
consists in the presence of the two rows of carpels one above 
another (a state of things which occurs exceptionally in apples 
and oranges), and in the fact that, while in the lower series the 
seeds are attached to the inner border or lower angle of the cavity, 
they occupy the outer side in the upper series, as if during growth 
the upper whorl had become completely hent over. 

By Bentham and Hooker the Punica is included as an anoma- 
lous genus in the order Lythraceae; others consider it more 
nearly allied to the myrtles; while its peculiarities are so great as, 
in the opinion of many botanists, to justify its inclusion in a 



POMERANIA 



4-7 



separate order, Punicaceae. Not only is the fruit valuable in 
hot countries for the sake'of its pulp, but the rind and the bark 
and the outer part of the root (containing the alkaloid pelle- 
ticrine) are valuable as astringents. The bark of the root is 
likewise valued as an anthelmintic in cases of tape-worm. 

The tree is wild in Afghanistan, north-western India, and the 
districts south and south-west of the Caspian, but it has been so 
long cultivated that it is difficult to say whether it is really 
native in Palestine and the Mediterranean region. It has been 
cited as wild in northern Africa, but this appears to be a mistake. 
Professor Bayley Balfour met with a wild species, heretofore un- 
known, in the island of Socotra, the flowers of which have only 
a single row of carpels, which suggests the inference that it may 
have been the source of the cultivated varieties. But, on the other 
hand, in Afghanistan, where Aitchison met with the tree truly 
wild, a double row of carpels was present as usual. The antiquity 
of the tree as a cultivated plant is evidenced by the Sanskrit 
name Dd^'imba, and by the references to the fruit in the Old 
Testament, and in the Odyssey, where it is spoken of as cultivated 
in the gardens of the kings of, Phaeacia and Phrygia. The fruit 
is frequently represented on ancient Assyrian and Egyptian 
sculptures, and had a religious significance in connexion with 
several Oriental cults, especially the Phrygian cult of Cybele 
(Arnob. v. 5 seq.; see also Baudissin, Studien, ii. 207 seq.). It 
was well known to the Greeks and Romans, who were acquainted 
with its medicinal properties and its use as a tanning material. 
The name given by the Romans, malum punicum, indicates that 
they received it from Carthage, as indeed is expressly stated 
by Pliny; and this circumstance has given rise to the notion that 
the tree was indigenous in northern Africa. On a review of the 
whole evidence, botanical, literary and linguistic, Alphonse de 
Candolle (Origin of Cultivated Plants) pronounces against its 
African origin, and decides in favour of its source in Persia and 
the neighbouring countries. According to Saporta, the pomegra- 
nate existed in a fossil state in beds of the Pliocene epoch near 
Meximieux in Burgundy. The pomegranate is sometimes met 
with in cultivation against a wall in England, but it is too tender 
to withstand a severe winter. The double-flowered varieties 
are specially desirable for the beauty and long duration of their 
flowers. 

POMERANIA (German, Pommern), a territory of Germany 
and a maritime province of Prussia, bounded on the N. by the 
Baltic, on the W. by Mecklenburg, on the S. by Brandenburg, 
and on the E. by West Prussia. Its area is 11,630 sq. m., and 
the population in 1905 was 1,684,125, showing a density of 145 
inhabitants to the square mile. The province is officially divided 
into the three districts of Stralsund, Stettin and Koslin, but more 
historical interest attaches to the names of Vorporamern and 
Hinterpommern, or Hither and Farther Pomerania, the former 
being applied to the territory to the west, and the latter to that 
to the east of the Oder. Pomerania is one of the flattest parts 
of Germany, although east of the Oder it is traversed by a range 
of low hills, and there are also a few isolated eminences to the 
west. Off the west coast, which is very irregular, lie the islands of 
Riigcn, Usedom and Wollin; the coast of Farther Pomerania is 
smooth in outline and is bordered with dunes, or sandbanks. 
Besides the Oder and its affluents, the chief of which are the 
Peene, the t)cker and the Ihna, there are several smaller rivers 
flowing into the Baltic; a few of these are navigable for ships, 
but the greater number only carry rafts. Many of them end in 
small lakes, which are separated from the sea by narrow strips 
of land, through which the water escapes by one or more outlets. 
The interior of the province is also thickly sprinkled with lakes, 
the combined area of which is equal to about one-twentieth of 
the entire surface. 

The soil of Pomerania is for the most part thin and sandy, 
but patches of good land are found here and there. About 55% 
of the whole is under tillage, while 16% consists of meadow and 
pasture and 21 % is covered by forests. The principal crops are 
potatoes, rye and oats, but wheat and barley are grown in the 
more fertile districts; tobacco, flax, hops and beetroot are also 
cultivated. Agriculture is still carried on in a somewhat 



primitive fashion, and as a rule the livestock is of an inferior 
quality, though the breed of horses, of a heavy build and mostly 
used in agriculture, is held in high esteem. Large flocks of sheep 
are kept, both for their flesh and their wool, and there are in the 
province large numbers of horned cattle and of pigs. Geese 
and goose feathers form lucrative articles of export. Owing 
to the long line of coast and the numerous lakes, fishing forms an 
important industry, and large quantities of herrings, eels and 
lampreys are sent from Pomerania to other parts of Germany. 
With the exception of the almost inexhaustible layers of peat, 
the mineral wealth of the province is insignificant. Its industrial 
activity is not great, but there are manufactures of machinery, 
chemicals, paper, tobacco and sugar; these are made chiefly 
in or near the large towns, while linen-weaving is practised as a 
domestic industry. Ship-building is carried on at Stettin and at 
several places along the coast. The commerce of Pomerania 
is in a flourishing condition, its principal ports being Stettin, 
Stralsund and Swinemunde. Education is provided for by a 
university at Greifswald and by numerous schools. The province 
sends 14 members to the German Reichstag, and 26 to the Prussian 
house of representatives. The heir to the Prussian crown bears 
the title of governor of Pomerania. 

History. — In prehistoric times the southern coast of the Baltic 
seems to have been occupied by Celts, who af terwards made way 
for tribes of Teutonic stock. These in their turn migrated to 
other settlements and were replaced, about the end of the 5th 
century of our era, by Slavonic tribes, the Wilzi and the Pomerani. 
The name of Pomore, or Pommern, meaning " on the sea," was 
given to the district by the latter of the tribes about the time of 
Charlemagne, and it has often changed its political and geo- 
graphical significance. Originally it seems to have denoted the 
coast district between the Oder and the Vistula, a territory 
which was at first more or less dependent on Poland, but which, 
towards the end of the 12th century, was ruled by two native 
princes, who took the title of duke about n 70 and admitted the 
authority of the German king in 1181. Afterwards Pomerania 
extended much farther to the west, while being correspondingly 
curtailed on the east, and a distinction was made between 
Slavinia, or modern Pomerania, and Pomercllcn. The latter, 
corresponding substantially to the present province of West 
Prussia, remained subject to Poland until 1309, when it was 
divided between Brandenburg and the Teutonic Order. 
Christianity was introduced in the 12th century, a bishopric 
being founded in the Island of Wollin, and its advance went 
rapidly hand in hand with the Germanizing of the district. 

The history of Pomerania, as distinct from that of Pomerellen, 
consists mainly of an almost endless succession of divisions of 
territory among the different lines of the ducal house, and of 
numerous expansions and contractions of territory through 
constant hostilities with the elector of Brandenburg, who 
claimed to be the immediate feudal superior of Pomerania, 
and with other neighbouring rulers. The names of Vorpom- 
mern and Hinterpommern were at first synonymous with 
Pomerania proper, or Slavinia and Pomerellen, but towards 
the close of the 14th century they were transferred to the two 
duchies into which the former was divided. In 1625 the 
whole of Pomerania became united under the sway of Duke 
Bogislaus XIV., and on his death without issue, in 1637, Branden- 
burg claimed the duchy by virtue of a compact made in 1571. 
In the meantime, however, Pomerania had been devastated 
by the Thirty Years' War and occupied by the Swedes, who had 
taken possession of its towns and fortresses. At the peace of 
Westphalia they claimed the duchy, in opposition to the elector 
of Brandenburg, and the result was that the latter was obliged to 
content himself with eastern Pomerania (Hinterpommern), and 
to see the western part (Vorpommern) awarded to Sweden. In 
1720, by the peace of Stockholm, Swedish Pomerania was cur- 
tailed by extensive concessions to Prussia, but the district to the 
west of the Peene remained in the possession of Sweden until the 
general European settlement of 1815. Then Sweden assigned 
her German possessions to Denmark in exchange for Norway, 
whereupon Prussia, partly by purchase and partly by the cession

of the duchy of Lauenburg, finally succeeded in uniting the whole 
of Pomerania under her rule.

POMEROY, a village and the county-seat of Meigs county, 
Ohio, U.S.A., on the Ohio river, about 85 m. S.S.E. of Columbus. 
Pop. (1890) 4726; (1900) 4639, including 453 foreign-born and 
280 negroes; (1910) 4023. Pomeroy is served by the Hocking 
Valley and (across the river) Baltimore & Ohio railways, by 
inter-urban electric railway, and by passenger and freight boats 
to the leading river ports. It occupies a strip of ground between 
the river and a range of steep hills. Bituminous coal and salt 
abound in the district, and there are deposits of building stone, 
fireclay and glass sand. The first settlement here was established 
in 1816, coal mining was begun three years later, and in 1827 a 
town was laid out and named Nyesville. There was little pro- 
gress, however, until 1833, when Samuel W. Pomeroy (in whose 
honour the present name was adopted) formed a company, 
which began mining coal on a large scale. Pomeroy was incor- 
porated as a village and was made the county-seat in 1841. In 
1850* the first of several salt wells, from 1000 to 1200 ft. in 
depth, was operated. 

POMFRET, JOHN (1667-1702), English poet, son of Thomas 
Pomfnet, vicar of Luton, was born in 1667. He was educated 
at Bedford grammar school and at Queens' College, Cambridge. 
He became rector of Maulden, Bedfordshire, in 1695, and of 
Millbrook in the same county in 1702. Dr Johnson says that 
the bishop of London refused to sanction preferment for him 
because in his Choice he declared that he would have no wife, 
although he expressed a wish for the occasional company of a 
modest and sprightly young lady. The poet was married in real 
life all the same, and — while waiting to clear up the misunder- 
standing with the bishop — he died in November 1702. The 
Choice or Wish: A Poem written by a Person of Quality (1700) 
expresses the epicurean desires of a cultivated man of Pomfret's 
time. It is smoothly written in the heroic couplet, and was widely 
popular. His Miscellany Poems were published in 1702. 

POMMEL (through 0. Fr. poniel, from a diminutive pomellus of 
Lat. pomuntj fruit, apple), any rounded object resembling an 
apple, e.g. the rounded termination of a saddle-bow; in archi- 
tecture, any round knob, as a boss, finial, &c. ; more particularly 
the rounded end to the hilt of a sword, dagger or other hand 
weapon, used to prevent the hand from slipping, and as a balance 
to the blade. " Pommel " is also a term used of a piece of 
grooved wood used in graining leather. This word may be 
the same in origin, or more probably from Fr. pautnelle, from 
paume, the hand, palm. 

POMMER, or Bombard (Fr. hautbois; Ital. bombardo t bombar- 
done), the alto, tenor and basses of the shawm or Schalmey 
family, and the forerunners respectively of the cor-anglais, 
bassoon or fagotto, and double bassoon or contrafagotto. The 
main difference to the casual observer between the medieval 
instruments and those of our orchestra which were evolved from 
them would be one of size. In the Pommers no attempt had 
been made to bend the tube, and its length, equal to that of an 
open organ pipe of- the same pitch, was outstretched in all its 
unwieldiness in an oblique position in front of the performer. 
The great contrabass Pommer was 9 ft. long without the 
crook and reed, which, however, were bent downwards. It had 
five open fingerholes and five keys working inside a perforated 
case; in order to bring the holes within reach of the finger, they 
were cut obliquely through the tube. The compass extended 



from F below 8 ft. C to E or F in the bass stave, two octaves in all. 
The other members of the family were the bass Pommer, from 
8 ft. C to middle C, corresponding to the modern bassoon or 
fagotto; the tenor or basset Pommer, a fifth higher in pitch; the 
alto pommer or nicolo, a fourth or a fifth above the tenor; and 
the high alto, or Klein Alt Pommer, an octave higher than the 
tenor, corresponding approximately to the cor-anglais. 

For the history of the Pommer family see Oboe and Bassoon.

POMONA, an old Italian goddess of fruit and gardens. Ovid 
(Met. xiv. 623) tells, the story of her courtship by the silvan 
deities and how Vertumnus, god of the turning year, wooed 
and won her. Corresponding to Pomona there seems to have 
been a male Italian deity, called Pomunus, who was perhaps 
identical with Vertumnus. Although chiefly worsnipped in the 
country, Pomona had a special priest at Rome, the flamen Pomo- 
nalis, and a sacred grove near Ostia, called the Pomonal. She 
was represented as a beautiful maiden, with fruits in her bosom 
and a pruning-knife in her hand. 

POMONA, a city of Los Angeles county, in southern Cali- 
fornia, U.S.A., about ^3 m. E. of the city of Los Angeles. Pop. 
(1890) 3634; (1900) 5526 (567 foreign-born); (1910) 10,207. *t is 
served by the Southern Pacific, the San Pedro, Los Angeles & 
Salt Lake, and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railways, 
and by an inter-urban electric line. The city is about 850 ft. 
above sea-level, and has a Carnegie library and several parks, 
including Ganesha park (45 acres), which commands a fine view. 
At Claremont, about 3 m. north, is Pomona College (1888, co- 
educational), which in 1908 had 34 instructors and 488 students. 
Pomona is in the midst of a prosperous fruit region, devoted 
especially to the growing of oranges. Orchards of oranges, 
lemons, apricots, peaches and prunes surround the city for miles, 
and some olives are grown; alfalfa and sugar-beets are raised in 
large quantities in the immediate neighbourhood. Pomona was 
settled by a colony of fruit-growers in 1875, and was chartered 
as a city in 1888. 

POMONA, or Mainland, the central 1 and' largest island of 
the Orkneys, Scotland. Pop. (1901), 16,235. It is 25 m. long 
from N.W. to S.E. and 15 m. broad from E. to W.; area, 190 
sq. m.; but where the coast is cut into, on the N. by Kirkwall 
Bay and on the S. by Scapa Flow, the land is less than 2 m. across. 
Consequently, the portion of the island to the west of the waist 
of Pomona is sometimes described as the West Island, and the 
portion to the East as the East Island. The west coast is 
almost unbroken, the bays of Birsay and Skaill being the only 
bays of any importance. The east and south shores, on the 
other hand, are extensively carved out. Thus on the east 
side are found Eynhallow Sound, Wood Wick, the bays of 
Isbister, Firth, Kirkwall, and Inganess and Dee Sound, and on 
the south Holm Sound, Scapa Bay, Swanbister Bay and Bay 
of Ireland. The highest points of the watershed from Costa 
Head to the Scapa shore are Milldoe (734 ft.) to the north-east 
of Isbister and Wideford Hill (740 ft.) to the west of Kirkwall. 
There are also a few eminences towards the south-west, Ward 
Hill (880 ft.) in the parish of Orphir being the highest peak in 
the island. There are numerous lakes, some of considerable 
size and most of them abounding with trout. Loch Hafray is 
4J m. long by from J m. to about 2 m. wide, and Loch Stenness 
3jm. long by from f to 2 I m. wide. Lochs Swannay, Board- 
house and Hundland are situated in the extreme north, while 
Loch Kirbister lies near the south coast and Loch Tankerness 
adjoins Deer Sound. Off the east coast lie the islands of Rousay, 
Egilshay, Viera, Eynhallow, Gairsay and Shapinshay, and off 
the south Copinshay and Lamb Holm. The hilly country is 
mostly moorland, and peat-mosses are met with in some of the 
low-lying land, but many of the valleys contain fertile soil, and 
there are productive tracts on the eastern and northern seaboard. 
Kirkwall, the capital of the Orkneys, and Stromness are the only 
towns. 

In Harray, the only parish in the Orkneys not trenched at 
some point by the sea, Norse customs have survived longer than 
elsewhere in the group save in North Ronaldshay. In Deerness

the most easterly parish in Pomona, were buried 200 Covenanters, 
taken prisoners at the battle of Bothwell Brig. They were 
carried to Barbados, to be sold as slaves for the plantations, 
when the ship foundered in Deer Sound, and all were drowned. 
In Sandside Bay, in the same parish, the fleet of Malcolm 
Canmorc was defeated by that of Jarl Thorfinn; and at 
Summersdalc, towards the northern base of the hills of Orphir, 
Sir James Sinclair, governor of Kirkwall, vanquished Lord 
Sinclair and 500 Caithness men in 1529. 

The antiquities of Pomona are of great interest. The examples 
of Pictish remains include brocks or round towers, chambered 
mounds, or buildings of stone covered in with earth, and weems, 
or underground dwellings afterwards roofed in. At Savcrock, 
on the west wing of Kirkwall Bay, a good specimen of an earth- 
house will be found, and at Quanterness, 1 m. to the west of it, a 
chambered mound, containing seven rooms with beehive roofs. 
Farther west and 5 m. by road north-east of Stromness, and 
within a mile of the stone circles of Stenness, stands the great 
barrow or chambered mound of Maeshowe. The tumulus has 
the form of a blunted cone, is 36 ft. high, 300 ft. in circum- 
ference and 92 ft. in diameter, and at a distance of 90 ft. from 
its base is encircled by a moat 40 ft. wide and from 4 ft. to 8 ft. 
deep. The ground-plan shows that it was entered from the west 
by a passage, 54 ft. long, from 2 ft. to 3 ft. wide and from 2 J ft. 
to 4§ ft. high, which led to a central apartment about 15 ft. 
square, the walls of which ended in a beehive roof, the spring 
of which began at a height of 13 ft. from the floor. This room 
and the passage are built of undressed blocks and slabs of sand- 
stone. About the middle of each side of the chamber, at a 
height of 3 ft. from the floor, there is an entrance to a small 
cell, 3 ft. high, 4^ ft. wide and from 5? ft. to 7 ft. long. Mr 
James Farrer explored the mound in 1861, and discovered on the 
walls and certain stones rude drawings of crosses, a winged 
dragon, and a serpent curled round a pole, besides a variety of 
Runic inscriptions. One of these inscriptions stated that the 
tumulus had been rifled by Norse pilgrims (possibly crusaders) 
on their way to Jerusalem under Jarl Rognvald in the 12th 
century. There can be little doubt but that it was a 
sepulchral chamber. Joseph Anderson ascribes it to the Stone 
Age (tnat is, to the Picts), and James Fergusson to Norsemen of 
the 10th century. 

The most interesting of all those links with a remote past are 
the stone circles forming the Ring of Brogar and the Ring of 
Stenness, often inaccurately described as the Stones of Stenness. 
The Ring of Brogar is situated to the north-west and the Ring of 
Stenness to the south-east of the Bridge of Brogar, as the narrow 
causeway of stone slabs is called which separates Loch Harray 
from Loch Stenness. The district lies some 4^ m. north-east 
of Stromness. The Ring of Brogar, once known as the Temple 
of the Sun, stands on a raised, circular platform of turf, 340 ft. 
in diameter, surrounded by a* moat about 6 ft. deep, which in 
turn is invested by a grassy rampart. The ring originally 
comprised 60 stones, set up at intervals of 17 ft. Only 13 are 
now erect. Ten, still entire, lie prostrate, while the stumps of 
13 others can yet be recognized. The height of the stones 
varies from 9 ft. to 14 ft. The Ring of Stenness — the Temple 
of the Moon of local tradition — is of similar construction to the 
larger circle, except that its round platform is only 104 ft. in 
diameter. The stones are believed to have numbered 12, 
varying in height from 15 ft. to 17 ft. but only two remain up- 
right. In the middle of the ring may be seen the relic of what 
was probably the sacrificial altar. The Stone of Odin, the 
great monolith, pierced by a hole at a height of 5 ft. from the 
ground, which figures so prominently in Scott's F irate, stood 
150 yds. to the north of the Ring of Stenness. The stones of 
both rings are of the native Old Red Sandstone. 

POMPADOUR, JEANNE ANTOINETTE POISSON LE NOR- 
MANT D'frriOLES, Marquise de (1721-1764), mistress of 
Louis XV., was born in Paris on the 29th of December 1721, and 
baptized as the legitimate daughter of Francois Poisson, an 
officer in the household of the duke of Orleans, and his wife, 
Madeleine de la Motte, in the church of St Eustache; but she 



was suspected, as well as her brother, afterwards marquis of 
Marigny, to be the child of a very wealthy financier and farmer- 
general of the revenues, Le Normant de Tournehem. He at 
any rate took upon himself the charge of her education; and, as 
from the beauty and wit she showed from childhood she seemed 
to be born for some uncommon destiny, he declared her " un 
morceau de roi," and specially educated her to be a king's 
mistress. This idea was confirmed in her childish mind by the 
prophecy of an old woman, whom in after days she pensioned 
for the correctness of her prediction. In 1741 she was married 
to a nephew of her protector and guardian, Le Normant d'fitioles, 
who was passionately in love with her r and she soon became a 
queen of fashion. Yet the world of the financiers at Paris was 
far apart from the court world, where she wished to reign; 
she could get no introduction at court, and could only try to 
catch the king's eye when he went out hunting. But Louis XV. 
was then under the influence of Mme de Mailly, who carefully 
prevented any further intimacy with "la petite fitioles," and 
it was not until after her death that the king met the fair queen 
of the financial world of Paris at a ball given by the city to the 
dauphin in 1744, and he was immediately subjugated. She at 
once gave up her husband, and in 1745 was established at 
Versailles as " maitresse en titre." Louis XV. bought her the 
estate of Pompadour, from which she took her title of marquise 
(raised in 1752 to that of duchess). She was hardly established 
firmly in power before she showed that ambition rather than 
love had guided her, and began to mix in politics. Knowing 
that the French people of that time were ruled by the literary 
kings of the time, she paid court to them, and tried to play the 
part of a Maecenas. Voltaire was her poet in chief, and the 
founder of the physiocrats, Quesnay, was her physician. In the 
arts she was even more successful; she was herself no mean etcher 
and engraver, and she encouraged and protected Vanloo, Boucher, 
Vien, Greuze, and the engraver Jacques Guay. Yet this policy 
did not prevent her from being lampooned, and the famous 
poissardes against her contributed to the ruin of many wits 
suspected of being among the authors, and notably of the Comte 
de Maurepas. The command of the political situation passed 
entirely into her hands; she it was who brought Belle-Isle into 
office with his vigorous policy; she corresponded regularly with 
the generals of the armies in the field, as her letters to the Comte 
de Clermont prove; and she introduced the Abbe de Bernis into 
the ministry in order to effect a very great alteration of French 
politics in 1 756. The continuous policy of France since the days 
of Richelieu had been to weaken the house of Austria by alliances 
in Germany; but Mme de Pompadour changed this hereditary 
policy because Frederick the Great wrote scandalous verses on 
her; and because Maria Theresa wrote her a friendly letter she 
entered into an alliance with Austria. This alliance brought on 
the Seven Years' War, with all its disasters, the battle of Rosbach 
and the loss of Canada; but Mme de Pompadour persisted 
in her policy, and, when Bernis failed her, brought Choiseul 
into office and supported him in all his great plans, the 
Pacte de Famille, the suppression of the Jesuits, and the 
peace of Versailles. But it was to internal politics that 
this remarkable woman paid most attention; no one obtained 
office except through her; in imitation of Mme de Maintenon, 
she prepared all business for the king's eye with the 
ministers, and contrived that they should meet in her room; 
and she daily examined the letters sent through the post 
office with Janelle, the director of the post office. By this 
continuous labour she made herself indispensable to Louis. 
Yet, when after a year or two she had lost the heart 
of her lover, she had a difficult task before her; to maintain 
her influence she had not only to save the king as much trouble 
as possible, but to find him fresh pleasures. When he first 
began to weary of her she remembered her talent for acting 
and her private theatricals at fitioles, and established the 
" theatre des petits cabinets," in which she acted with the greatest 
lords about the court for the king's pleasure in tragedies and 
comedies, operas and ballets. By this means and the " concerts 
spirituels " she kept in favour for a time; but at last she found a

surer way, by encouraging the king in his debaucheries, and Louis 
wept over her kindness to his various mistresses. Only once, 
when the king was wounded by Damiens in 1757, did she receive 
a serious shock, and momentarily left the court; but on his 
recovery she returned more powerful than ever. She even 
ingratiated herself with the queen, after the example of 
Mme de Main tenon, and was made a lady-in-waiting; but the 
end was soon to come. " Ma vie est un combat," she said, 
and so it was, with business and pleasure she gradually grew 
weaker and weaker, and when told that death was at hand she 
dressed herself in full court costume, and met it bravely on the 
15th of April 1764, at the age of forty-two.

POMPEII, 1 an ancient town of Campania, Italy, situated near 
the river Sarnus, nearly 2 m. from the shore of the Bay of 
Naples, almost at the foot of Mt Vesuvius. Of its history before 
79 B.C. comparatively little is recorded; but it appears that it 
had a population of a very mixed character, and passed succes- 
sively into the hands of several different peoples, each of which 
contributed an element to its composition. Its foundation was 
ascribed by Greek tradition to Heracles, in common with the 
neighbouring city of Herculaneum, but it is certain that it was 
not a Greek colony, in the proper sense of the term, as we know 
to have been the case with the more important cities of Cumae 
and Neapolis. Strabo'(v. 4, 8), in whose time it was a populous 
and flourishing place, tells us that it was first occupied by the 
Oscans 2 (to whom we must attribute the Doric temple in the 
Foro Triangolare), afterwards by the Tyrrhenians (i.e. Etruscans) 
and Pelasgians, and lastly, by the Samnites. The conquest of 
Campania by the last-mentioned people is an undoubted historical 
fact, and there can be no doubt that Pompeii shared the fate of 
the neighbouring cities on this occasion, and afterwards passed 
in common with them under the yoke of Rome. But its name 
is only once mentioned during the wars of the Romans with 
the Samnites and Campanians in this region of Italy, and then 
only incidentally (Liv. ix. 38), when a Roman fleet landed near 
Pompeii in 309 B.C. and made an unsuccessful marauding 
expedition up the river valley as far as Nuceria. 3 At a later 
period, however, it took a prominent part in the outbreak of the 
nations of central Italy, known as the Social War (91-89 B.C.), 
when it withstood a long siege by Sulla, and was one of the last 
cities of Campania that were reduced by the Roman arms. The 
inhabitants were admitted to the Roman franchise, but a military 
colony was settled in their territory in 80 B.C. by Sulla (Colonia 
Cornelia Veneria Pompeianorum) , and the whole population 
was rapidly Romanized. The municipal administration here, 
as elsewhere, was in the hands of two duoviri iure dicundo and 
two aediles, the supreme body being the city council (decuriones) . 
Before the close of the republic it became a resort of the Roman 
nobles, many of whom acquired villas in the neighbourhood. 
Among them was Cicero, whose letters abound with allusions 
to his Pompeian villa. The same fashion continued under the 
empire, and there can be no doubt that, during the first century 
of the Christian era, Pompeii bad become a flourishing place 
# l The etymology of the name is uncertain; the ancients derived 
it from pompa or tt£/xxw (Gr. send), in allusion to the journey of 
Heracles with the oxen of Geryon, but modern authorities refer 
it to the Oscan pompa (five).

with a considerable population. Two events only are recorded 
of its history during this period. In a.d. 59 a tumult took place 
in the amphitheatre between the citizens and visitors from the 
neighbouring colony of Nuceria. Many were killed and wounded 
on both sides. The Pompeians were punished for this violent 
outbreak by the prohibition of all theatrical exhibitions for 
ten years (Tacitus, Ann. xiv. 17). A characteristic, though 
rude, painting, found on the walls of one of the houses gives a 
representation of this event. 

Four years afterwards (a.d. 63) an earthquake, which affected 
all the neighbouring towns, vented its force especially upon 
Pompeii, a large part of which, including most of the public 
buildings, was either destroyed or so seriously damaged as to 
require to be rebuilt (Tac. Amu xv. 22; Seneca, Q.N. vi. 1). 
From the existing remains it is clear that the inhabitants were 
still actively engaged in repairing and restoring the ruined edifices 
when the whole city was overwhelmed by the great eruption 
of a.d. 79. Vesuvius (q.v.) t the volcanic forces of which had been 
slumbering for unknown ages, suddenly burst into violent 
eruption, which, while it carried devastation all around the 
beautiful gulf, buried the two cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii 
under dense beds of cinders and ashes. It is singular that, while 
we possess a detailed description of this famous eruption in two 
letters of the younger Pliny (Epist. vi. 16, 20), he does not even 
notice the destruction of Pompeii or Herculaneum, though his 
uncle perished in the immediate neighbourhood of the former 
city. But their fate is noticed by Dio Cassius, and its circum- 
stances may be gathered with certainty from the condition in 
which the city has been found. These were such as to conduce to 
its preservation and interest as a relic of antiquity. Pompeii was 
merely covered with a bed of lighter substances, cinders, small 
stones and ashes, which fell in a dry state, while at Herculaneum 
the same substances, being drenched with water, hardened into 
a sort of tufa, which in places is 65 ft. deep. The whole of this 
superincumbent mass, attaining to an average thickness of from 
18 to 20 ft., was the product of one eruption, though the materials 
may^ be divided generally into two distinct strata, the one 
consisting principally of cinders and small volcanic stones 
(called in Italian lapilli) y and the other and uppermost layer of 
fine white ash, often. consolidated by the action of water from 
above so as to take the moulds of objects contained in it (such 
as dead bodies, woodwork, &c), like clay or plaster of Paris. 
It was found impossible to rebuild the town, and its territory 
was joined to that of Nola. But the survivors returned to the 
spot, and by digging down and tunnelling were able to remove 
all the objects of value, even the marble facing slabs of the large 
buildings. 

In the middle ages, however, the very site was forgotten. 
Two inscriptions were found in making an underground aqueduct 
across the site in 1 594-1 600, but it was not until 1748 that a more 
careful inspection of this channel -revealed the fact that beneath 
the vineyards and mulberry grounds which covered the site 
there lay entombed ruins far more accessible, if not more inter- 
esting, than those of Herculaneum. It was not till 1763 that 
systematic excavations were begun; and, though they were 
carried on during the rest of the 18th century, it was only in 
the beginning of the 19th that they assumed a regular character; 
the work, which had received a vigorous stimulus during the 
period of the French government (1806-1814), was prosecuted, 
though in a less methodical manner, under the rule of the Bour- 
bon kings (1815-1861). Since 1861 it has been carried on under 
the Italian government in a more scientific manner, on a system 
devised by G. Fiorelli (d. 1896), according to which the town is 
for convenience divided into nine regions — though this rests 
on a misconception, for there is really no street between the 
Capua and the Nocera gates— and the results have been of the 
highest interest, though the rate of progress has been very 
slow. 

The town was situated on rising ground less than a mile from 
the foot of Vesuvius. This eminence is itself due to an outflow 
of lava from that mountain, during some previous eruption in 
prehistoric times, for we know from Strabo that Vesuvius had

hcen quiescent ever since the first records of the Greek settle- 
ments in this part of Italy. Pompeii in ancient times was a 
prosperous seaport town situated close to the seashore, from 
which it is now nearly 2 m. distant, and adjoining the mouth 
of the river Sarnus or Sarno, which now enters the sea 
nearly 2 m. from its site. The present course of this stream is 
due in part to modern alteration of its channel, as well as to the 
effects of the great eruption. The prosperity of Pompeii was 
due partly to its commerce, as the port of the neighbouring 
towns, partly to the fertility of its territory, which produced 
strong wine, olive oil (a comparatively small quantity), and 
vegetables; fish sauces were made here. Millstones and pumice 
were also exported, but for the former the more gritty lava of 
Rocca Monfina was later on preferred. 

The area occupied by the ancient city was of an irregular 
oval form, and ahout 2 m. in circumference. It was sur- 
rounded hy a wall, which is still preserved for more than 
two-thirds of its extent, but no traces of this are found on the 
side towards the sea, and there is no doubt that on this side 
it had been already demolished in ancient, times, so as to give 
room for the free extension of houses and other buildings in 
that direction. 1 These walls are strengthened at intervals by 
numerous towers, occupying the full width of the wall, which 
occur in some parts at a distance of only about 100 yds., but in 
general much less frequently. They are, however, of a different 
style of construction from the walls, and appear to have been 
added at a later period, probably that of the Social War. Similar 
evidences of the addition of subsequent defences are to be traced 
also in the case of the gates, of which no less than eight are found 
in the existing circuit of the walls. Some of these present a 
very elaborate system of defence, but it is evident from the 
decayed condition of others, as well as of parts of the walls and 
towers, that they had ceased to be maintained for the purposes 
of fortification long before the destruction of the city. The 
names by which the gates and streets are known are entirely of 
modern origin. 

The general plan of the town is very regular, the streets being 
generally straight, and crossing one another at right angles 
or nearly so. But exceptions are found on the west in the street 
leading from the Porta Ercolanese (gate of Herculancum) to 
the forum, which, though it must have heen one of the principal 
thoroughfares in the city, was crooked and irregular, as well as 
verynarrow, in some parts not exceeding 12 to 14 ft. in width, 
including the raised footpaths on each side, which occupy a 
considerable part of the space, so that the carriage-way could 
only have admitted of the passage of one vehicle at a time. 
The explanation is that it follows the line of the demolished 
city wall. Another exception is to he found in the Strada 
Stahiana (Stabian Street) or Cardo, which, owing to the existence 
of a natural depression which affects also the line of the street 
just east of it, is not parallel to the other north and south streets. 
The other main streets arc in some cases broader, but rarely 
exceed 20 ft. in width, and the broadest yet found is ahout 32, 
while the back streets running parallel to the main lines are only 
about 14 ft. (It is to be remembered, however, that the standard 
width of a Roman highroad in the neighbourhood of Rome itself 
is about 14 ft.) They are uniformly paved with large poly- 
gonal blocks of hard basaltic lava, fitted very closely together, 
though now in many cases marked with deep ruts from the passage 
of vehicles in ancient times. They are also in all cases bordered 
hy raised footways on both sides, paved in a similar manner; 
and for the convenience of foot-passengers, which was evidently 
a more important consideration than the obstacle which the 
arrangement presented to the passage of vehicles, which indeed 
were prohably only allowed for goods traffic, these are connected 
from place to place by stepping-stones raised above the level of 
the carriage-way. In other respects they must have rescmhled 
those of Oriental cities — the living apartments all opening 
towards the interior, and showing only blank walls towards

the street; while the windows were generally to be found only 
in the upper storey, and were in all cases small and insignificant, 
without any attempt at architectural effect. In some instances 
indeed the monotony of their external appearance was broken 
hy small shops, occupying the front of the principal houses, 
and let off separately; these were in some cases numerous enough 
to form a continuous facade to the street. This is seen especially 
in the case of the street from the Porta Ercolanese to the forum 
and the Strada Stahiana (or Cardo), both of which were among 
the most frequented thoroughfares. The streets were also 
diversified by fountains, small water-towers and reservoirs 
(of which an especially interesting example was found in 1902 
close to the Porta del Vesuvio) and street shrines. The source 
of the water-supply is unknown. 

The first-mentioned of the two principal streets was crossed, a 
little before it reached the forum, by the street which led directly 
to the gate of Nola (Strada delle Terme, dclla Fortuna, and di 
Nola). Parallel to this last to the south is a street which runs 
from the Porta Marina through the forum, and then, with a 
slight turn, to the Sarno gate, thus traversing the. whole area of 
the city from east to west (Via Marina, Strada dell' Abbondanza, 
Strada dei Diadumeni). These two east and west streets are 
the two decumani. 

The population of Pompeii at the time of its destruction 
cannot be fixed with certainty, but it may very likely have ex- 
ceeded 20,000. It was of a mixed character; both Oscan 
and Greek inscriptions are still found up to the last, and, though 
there is no trace whatever of Christianity, evidences of the 
presence of Jews are not lacking — such are a wall-painting, 
probably representing the Judgment of Solomon, and a scratched 
inscription on a wall, " Sodoma, Gomora." It has been estimated, 
from the number of skeletons discovered, that about 2000 
persons perished in the city itself in the eruption of a.d. 79. 

Almost the whole portion of the city which lies to the west of 
the Strada Stahiana, towards the forum and the sea, has been 
more or less completely excavated. It is over one-half of the 
whole extent, and that the most important portion, inasmuch as 
it includes the forum, with the temples and public buildings 
adjacent to it, the thermae, theatres, amphitheatre, &c. The 
greater part of that on the other side of the Strada Stabiana 
remains still unexplored, with the exception of the amphi- 
theatre, and a small space in its immediate neighbourhood. 

The forum at Pompeii was, as at Rome itself and in all 
other Itah'an cities, the focus and centre of all the life and 
movement of the city. Hence it was surrounded on all sides 
by public buildings or edifices of a commanding character. 
It was not, however, of large size, as compared to the open 
spaces in modern towns, being only 467 ft. in length by 126 in 
breadth (excluding the colonnades). Nor was it accessible to 
any description of wheeled carriages, and the nature of its 
pavement, composed of hroad flags of travertine, shows that it 
was only intended for foot-passengers. It was adorned with 
numerous statues, some of the imperial family, others of dis- 
tinguished citizens. Some of the inscribed pedestals of the latter 
have been found. It was surrounded on three sides by a series 
of porticos supported on columns; and these porticos were - 
originally surmounted by a gallery or upper storey, traces of the 
staircases leading to which still remain, though the gallery 
itself has altogether disappeared. It is, however, certain 
from the existing remains that both this portico and the adjacent 
buildings had suffered severely from the earthquake of 6$, and 
that they were undergoing a process of restoration, involving 
material changes in the original arrangements, which was 
still incomplete at the time of their final destruction. The 
north end of the forum, where alone the portico is wanting, is 
occupied in great part by the imposing temple of Jupiter, Juno 
and Minerva being also worshipped here. It was raised on a 
podium 10 ft. high, and had a portico with six Corinthian 
columns in front. This magnificent edifice had, however, been 
evidently overthrown by the earthquake of 63, and is in its 
present condition a mere ruin, the rebuilding of which had not 
been begun at the time of the eruption, so that the cult of 



52 



POMPEII 



the three Capitoline divinities was then carried on in the so- 
called temple of Zeus Milichius. On each side of it were two 
arches, affording an entrance into the forum, but capable of 
being closed by gates. On the east side of the forum were four 
edifices; all of them are of a public character, but their names and 
attribution have been the subject of much controversy. The 
first (proceeding from the north), once known as the Pantheon, 
is generally regarded as a macellum or meat-market, consisting 
of a rectangular court surrounded by a colonnade, with a twelve- 
sided roofed building (tholus) in the centre. On the south side 



and Q. Catulus (78 B.C.), and therefore belongs to the Oscan 
period of the city, before the introduction of the Roman colony. 
It was an oblong edifice divided by columns into a central hall 
and a corridor running round all the four sides with a tribunal 
opposite the main entrance; and, unlike the usual basilicae, it 
had, instead of a clerestory, openings in the walls of the corridor 
through which light was admitted, it being almost as lofty as 
the nave. The temple was an extensive edifice, having a com- 
paratively small cella, raised upon a podium, and standing in 
the midst of a wide space surrounded by a portico of^columns, 




(Redrawn by permission from Baedeker's Southern Italy.) 

were shops, and in the centre of the east side a chapel for the 
worship of the imperial house. Next to this comes the sanctuary 
of the Lares of the city, a square room with a large apse; and 
beyond this, as Mau proves, the small temple of Vespasian. 
Beyond this again, bounded on the south by the street known 
as the Strada dell* Abbondanza, is a large and spacious edifice, 
which, as we learn from an extant inscription, was erected by a 
priestess named Eumachia. Its purpose is uncertain — possibly 
~a' cloth-exchange, as the fullers set up a statue to Eumachia here. 
It is an open court, oblong, surrounded on all four sides by a 
colonnade; in front is a portico facing the forum, and on the 
other three sides theie is a corridor behind the colonnade with 
windows opening on it. On the south side of the Strada delT 
Abbondanza was a building which Mau conjectures to have been 
the Comitium. At the south end of the forum are three halls 
side by side, similar in plan with a common facade — the central 
one, the curia or council chamher, the others the offices respec- 
tively of the duumvirs and aediles, the principal officials of the 
city; while the greater part of the west side is occupied by two 
large buildings — a basilica, which is the largest edifice in 
Pompeii, and the temple of Apollo, which presents its side to 
the forum, and hence fills up a large portion of the surrounding 
space. The former, as we learn from an inscription scratched 
on its walls, was anterior in date to the consulship of M. Lepidus 



EnxryWilkcr jc 



outside which again is a wall, bounding the sacred enclosure. 
Between this temple and the basilica the Via Marina leads off 
direct to the Porta Marina. 

Besides the temples which surrounded the forum, the remains 
of five others have been discovered, three of which are situated 
in the immediate neighbourhood of the theatres. Of these by 
far the most interesting, though the least perfect, is one which 
is commonly known as the temple of Hercules (an appellation 
wholly without foundation), and which is not only by far the 
most ancient edifice in Pompeii, but presents us with all the 
characters of a true Greek temple, resembling in its proportions 
that of the earliest temple of Selinus, and probably of as remote 
antiquity (6th century B.C.). Unfortunately only.the- foundation 
and a few Doric capitals and other architectural fragments 
remain ; they were coated with stucco which was brightly painted. 
In front of the temple is a monument which seems to have been 
the tomb of the founder or founders of the city; so that for a time 
this must have been the most important temple. The period 
of its destruction is unknown, for it appears certain that it cannot 
be ascribed wholly to the earthquake of 63. On the other hand 
the reverence attached to it in the later periods of the city is 
evidenced by its being left standing in the midst of a triangular 
space adjoining the great theatre, which is surrounded by a 
portico, so as to constitute a kind of forum (the so-called Foro 



POMPEII 



53 



Triangolare). Not far off, and to the north of the great theatre, 
stood a small temple, which, as we learn from the inscription 
still remaining, was dedicated to Isis, and was rebuilt by a certain 
Popidius Celsinus at the age of six (really of course by his parents), 
after the* original edifice had been reduced to ruin by the great 
earthquake of 63. Though of small size, and by no means re- 
markable in point of architecture, it is interesting as the only 
temple that has come down to us in a good state of preservation 
of those dedicated to the Egyptian goddess, whose worship became 
so popular under the Roman Empire. The decorations were of 
somewhat gaudy stucco. The plan is curious, and deviates 
much from the ordinary type; the internal arrangements are 
adapted for the performance of the peculiar rites of this deity. 
Close to this temple was another, of very small size, commonly 
known as the temple of Aesculapius, but probably dedicated to 
Zeus Milichius. More considerable and important was a temple 
which stood at no great distance from the forum at the point 
where the so-called Strada di Mcrcurio was crossed by the wide 
line of thoroughfare (Strada della Fortuna) leading to the gate 
of Nola. We learn from an inscription that this was dedicated 
to the Fortune of Augustus (Fortuna Augusta), and was erected, 
wholly at his own cost, by a citizen of the name of M. Tullius. 
This temple appears to have suffered very severely from the 
earthquake, and at present affords little evidence of its original 
architectural ornament ; . but we learn from existing remains 
that its walls were covered with slabs of marble, and that the 
columns of the portico were of the same material. The fifth 
temple, that of Venus Pompeiana, lay to the west of the basilica; 
traces of two earlier periods underlie the extant temple, which 
was in progress of rebuilding at the time of the eruption. Before 
the earthquake of 63 it must have been the largest and most 
splendid temple of the whole city. It was surrounded by a 
large colonnade, and the number of marble columns in the whole 
block has been reckoned at 296, 

All the temples above described, except that ascribed to Her- 
cules, which was approached by steps on all four sides, agree in 
being raised on an elevated podium or basement — an arrange- 
ment usual with all similar buildings of Roman date. Neither 
in materials nor in style does their architecture exceed what 
might reasonably be expected in a second-rate provincial town; 
and the same may be said in general of the other public buildings. 
Among these the most conspicuous arc the theatres, of which there 
were two, placed, as was usual in Greek towns, in close juxta- 
position with one another. The largest of these which was partly 
excavated in the side of the hill, was a building of considerable 
magnificence, being in great part cased with marble, and fur- 
nished with seats of the same material, which have, however, 
been almost wholly removed. Its internal construction and 
arrangements resemble those of the Roman theatres in general, 
though with some peculiarities that show Greek influence, and 
we learn from an inscription that it was erected in Roman times 
by two members of the same family, M. Holconius Rufus and 
M. Holconius Ccler, both of whom held important municipal 
offices at Pompeii during the reign of Augustus. It appears, 
however, from a careful examination of the remains that their 
work was only a reconstruction of a more ancient edifice, the date 
of the original form of which cannot be fixed; while its first 
alteration belongs to the " tufa " period, and three other periods 
in its history can be traced. Recent investigations in regard to 
the vexed question of the position of the actors in the Greek 
theatre have as yet not led to any certain solution. 1 The smaller 
theatre, which was erected, as we learn from an inscription, by 
two magistrates specially appointed for the purpose by the 
decuriones of the city, was of older date than the large one, and 
must have been constructed a little before the amphitheatre, soon 
after the establishment of the Roman colony under Sulla. We 
learn also that it was permanently covered, and it was probably 
used for musical entertainments, but in the case of the larger 
theatre also the arrangements for the occasional extension of an 
awning (velarium) over the whole are distinctly found. The 

1 See A. Mau ? Pompeii in Leben und Kunsl (Leipzig, 1908), pp. 150 
sqq. 



smaller theatre is computed to have been capable of containing 
fifteen hundred spectators, while the larger could accommodate 
five thousand. 

Adjoining the theatres is a large rectangular enclosure, sur- 
rounded by a portico, at first the colonnade connected with the 
theatres, and converted, about the time of Nero, into the barracks 
of the gladiators, who were permanently maintained in the city 
with a view to the shows in the amphitheatre. This explains 
why it is so far from that building, which is situated at the 
south-eastern angle of the town, about 500 yds. from the 
theatres. Remains of gladiators' armour and weapons were 
found in some of the rooms, and in one, traces of the stocks used 
to confine insubordinate gladiators. The amphitheatre was 
erected by the same two magistrates who built the smaller 
theatre, C. Quinctius Valgusand M. Porcius (the former the father- 
in-law of that P. Servilius Rullus, in opposition to whose bill 
relating to the distribution of the public lands Cicero made his 
speech, De lege agraria), at a period when no permanent edifice 
of a similar kind had yet been erected in Rome itself, and is 
indeed the oldest structure of the kind known to us. But apart 
from its early date it has no special interest, and is wholly wanting 
in the external architectural decorations that give such grandeur 
of character to similar edifices in other instances. Being in 
great part excavated in the surface of the hill, instead of the 
seats being raised on arches, it is wanting also in the picturesque 
arched corridors which contribute so much to the effect of those 
other ruins. Nor are its dimensions (460 by 345 ft.) such as to 
place it in the first rank of structures of this class, nor are there 
any underground chambers below the arena, with devices for 
raising wild beasts, &c. But, as we learn from the case of their 
squabble with the people of Nuceria, the games celebrated in 
the amphitheatre on grand occasions would be visited by large 
numbers from the neighbouring towns. The seating capacity 
was about 20,000 2 (for illustration see Amphitheatre). 

Adjoining the amphitheatre was found a large open space, 
nearly square in form, which has been supposed to be a forum 
boarium or cattle-market, but, no buildings of interest being 
discovered around it, the excavation was filled up again, and 
this part of the city has not been since examined. Between 
the entrance to the triangular forum (so-called) and the temple 
of Isis is the Palaestra, an area surrounded by a colonnade; 
it is a structure of the pre-Roman period, intended for boys, not 
men. 

Among the more important public buildings of Pompeii 
were the public] baths (thermae). Three different establishments 
of this character have been discovered, of which the first, exca- 
vated in 1824, the baths near the forum, built about 80 B.C., was 
for a long time the only one known. Though the smallest of 
the three, it is in some respects the most complete and interesting; 
and it was until of late years the principal source from which we 
derived our knowledge of this important branch of the economy 
of Roman life. At Pompeii the baths are so well preserved as 
to show at a glance the purpose of all the different parts — while 
they are among the most richly decorated of all the buildings 
in the city. We trace without difficulty all the separate apart- 
ments that are described to us by Roman authors — the apody- 
terium 7 frigidarium, tepidarium, caldarium, &c. together with the 
apparatus for supplying both water and heat, the places for de- 
positing the bather's clothes, and other minor details (see Baths). 
The greater thermae (the so-called " Stabian " baths), which 
were originally built in the 2nd century B.C., and repaired about 
80 B.C., are on a much more extensive scale than the others, 
and combine with the special purposes of the building a palaestra 
in the centre and other apartments for exercise or recreation. 
The arrangements of the baths themselves are, however, almost 
similar to those of the lesser thermae. In this case an inscription 
records the repair and restoration of the edifice after the

even references to the admiration which gladiators won from the

earthquake of 63. It appears, however, that these two establish- 
ments were found inadequate to supply the wants of the in- 
habitants, and a third edifice of the same character, the so- 
called central baths, at the corner of the Strada Stabiana and the 
Strada di Nola, but on a still more extensive scale, intended 
for men only, while the other two had separate accommodation 
for both sexes, was in course of construction when the town was 
overwhelmed. 

Great as is the interest attached to the various public buildings 
of Pompeii, and valuable as is the light that they have in some 
instances thrown upon similar edifices in other ruined cities, 
far more curious and interesting is the insight afforded us by 
the numerous private houses and shops into the ordinary life 
and habits of the population of an ancient town. The houses 
at Pompeii are generally low, rarely exceeding two storeys in 
height, and it appears certain that the upper storey was generally 
of a slight construction, and occupied by small rooms, serving 
as garrets, or sleeping places for slaves, and perhaps for the 
females of the family. From the mode of destruction of the city 
these upper floors were in most cases crushed in and destroyed, 
and hence it was long believed that the houses for the most 
part had but one storey; but recent researches have in many 
cases brought to light incontestable evidence of the existence of 
an upper floor, and the frequent occurrence of a small staircase 
is in itself sufficient proof of the fact. The windows, as already 
mentioned, were generally small and insignificant, and contri- 
buted nothing to the external decoration or effect of the houses, 
which took both light and air from the inside, not from the 
outside. In some cases they were undoubtedly closed with 
glass, but its use appears to have been by no means general. 
The principal living rooms, as well as those intended for the 
reception of guests or clients, were all on the ground floor, the 
centre being formed by the atrium, or hall, which was almost 
always open above to the air, and in the larger houses was gener- 
ally surrounded with columns. Into this opened other rooms, 
the entrances to which seem to have been rarely protected by 
doors, and could only have been closed by curtains. At the 
back was a garden. Later, under Greek influences, a peristyle 
with rooms round it was added in place of the garden. We notice 
that, as in modern Italy until quite recent years, elaborate 
precautions were taken against heat, but none against cold, 
which was patiently endured. Hypocausts are only found in 
connexion with bathrooms. 

All the apartments and arrangements described by Vitruvius 
and other ancient writers may be readily traced in the houses 
of Pompeii, and in many instances these have for the first time 
enabled us to understand the technical terms and details trans- 
mitted to us by Latin authors. We must not, however, hastily 
assume that the examples thus preserved to us by a singular 
accident are to be taken as representing the style of building 
in all the Roman and Italian towns. We know from Cicero 
that Capua was remarkable for its broad streets and widespread 
buildings, and it is probable that the Campanian towns in 
general partook of the same character. At Pompeii indeed 
the streets were not wide, but they were straight and regular, 
and the houses of the better class occupied considerable spaces, 
presenting in this respect no doubt a striking contrast, not only 
with those of Rome itself, but with those of many other Italian 
towns, where the buildings would necessarily be huddled to- 
gether from the circumstances of their position. Even t at 
Pompeii itself, on the west side of the city, where the ground 
slopes somewhat steeply towards the sea, houses are found which 
consisted of three storeys or more. 

The excavations have provided examples of houses of every 
description, from the humble dwelling-place of the artisan or 
proletarian, with only three or four small rooms, to the stately 
mansions of Sallust, of the Faun, of the Golden Cupids, of the 
Silver Wedding, of the Vettii, of Pansa, 1 &c. — the last of which 
is among the most regular in plan, and may be taken as an almost

houses are either arbitrary or founded in the first instance upon 
erroneous inferences. 



perfect model of a complete Roman house of a superior class. 
But the general similarity in their plan and arrangement is very 
striking, and in all those that rise above a very humble class the 
leading divisions of the interior, the atrium, tablinum, peristyle, 
&c. may be traced with unfailing regularity. Another peculi- 
arity that is found in all the more considerable houses in Pompeii 
is that of the front, where it faces one of the principal streets, 
being occupied with shops, usually of small size, and without 
any communication with the interior of the mansion. In a few 
instances indeed such a communication is found, but in these 
cases it is probable that the shop was used for the sale of articles 
grown upon the estate of the proprietor, such as wine, fruit, oil, 
&c, a practice that is still common in Italy. In general the 
shop had a very small apartment behind it, and probably in 
most cases a sleeping chamber above it, though of this the only 
remaining evidence is usually a portion of the staircase that led 
to this upper room. The front of the shop was open to the 
street, but was capable of being closed with wooden shutters, 
the remains of which have in a few instances been preserved. 
Not only have the shops of silversmiths been recognized by the 
precious objects of that metal found in them, but large quantities 
of fruits of various kinds preserved in glass vessels, various de- 
scriptions of corn and pulse, loaves of bread, moulds for pastry, 
fishing-nets and many other objects too numerous to mention, 
have been found in such a condition as to be identified without 
difficulty. Inns and wine-shops appear to have been numerous; 
one of the latter we can see to have been a ihermopolium, where 
hot drinks were sold. Bakers' shops are also frequent, though- 
arrangements for grinding and baking appear to have formed 
part of every large family establishment. In other cases, how- 
ever, these were on a larger scale, provided with numerous 
querns or hand-mills of the well-known form, evidently intended 
for public supply. Another establishment on a large scale was 
a fullonica (fuller's shop), where all the details of the business 
were illustrated by paintings still visible on the walls. Dyers' 
shops, a tannery and a shop where colours were ground and 
manufactured — an important business where almost all the 
rooms of every house w T ere painted — are of special interest, as 
is also the house of a surgeon, where numerous surgical instru- 
ments were found, some of them of a very ingenious and elaborate 
description, but all made of b?onze. Another curious discovery 
was that of the abode of a sculptor, containing his tools, as well 
as blocks of marble and half-finished statues. The number 
of utensils of various kinds found in the houses and shops is 
almost endless, and, as these are in most cases of bronze, they are 
generally in perfect preservation. 

Of the numerous works of art discovered in the course of the 
excavations the statues and large works of sculpture, whether 
in marble or bronze, are inferior to those found at Herculaneum, 
but some of the bronze statuettes are of exquisite workmanship, 
while the profusion of ornamental works and objects in bronze 
and the elegance of their design, as well as the finished beauty 
of their execution, are such as to excite the utmost admiration — 
more especially when it is considered that these are the casual 
results of the examination of a second-rate provincial town, 
which had, further, been ransacked for valuables (as Hercu- 
laneum had not) after the eruption of 70. The same impression 
is produced in a still higher degree by the paintings with which 
the walls of the private houses, as well as those of the temples 
and other public buildings, are adorned, and which are not merely 
of a decorative character, but in many instances present us with 
elaborate compositions of figures, historical and mythological 
scenes, as well as representations of the ordinary life and manners 
of the people, which are full of interest to us, though often of 
inferior artistic execution. It has until lately been the practice 
to remove these to the museum at Naples; but the present 
tendency is to leave them (and even the movable objects 
found in the houses) in situ with all due precautions as to 
their preservation (as in the house of the Vettii, of the 
Silver Wedding, of the Golden Cupids, &c), which adds im- 
mensely to the interest of the houses; indeed, with the help 
of judicious restoration, their original condition is in large

measure reproduced. 1 In some cases it has even been possible 
to recover the original arrangement of the garden beds, and to 
replant them accordingly, thus giving an appropriate frame- 
work to the statues, &c. with which the gardens were 
decorated, and which have been found in situ. The same 
character of elaborate decoration, guided almost uniformly 
by good taste and artistic feeling, is displayed in the mosaic 
pavements, which in all but the humbler class of houses 
frequently form the ornament of their floors. One of these, in 
the House of the Faun, well known as the battle of Alexander, 
presents us with the most striking specimen of artistic com- 
position that has been preserved to us from antiquity. 

The architecture of Pompeii must be regarded as presenting 
in general a transitional character from the pure Greek style to 
that of the Roman Empire. The temples (as already observed) 
have always the Roman peculiarity of being raised on a podium 
of considerable elevation; and the same characteristic is found 
in most of the other public buildings. All the three orders of 
Greek architecture — the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian — are found 
freely employed in the various edifices of the city, but rarely 
in strict accordance with the rules of art in their proportions 
and details; while the private houses naturally exhibit still 
more deviation and irregularity. In many of these indeed we 
find varieties in the ornamentation, and even in such leading 
features as the capitals of the columns, which remind one rather 
of the vagaries of medieval architecture than of the strict rules 
of Vitruvius or the regularity of Greek edifices. One practice 
which is especially prevalent, so as to strike every casual visitor, 
and dates from the early years of the empire, is that of filling 
up the flutings of the columns for about one-third of their height 
with a thick coat of stucco, so as to give them the appearance 
of being smooth columns without flutings below, and only fluted 
above. The uhpleasing effect of this anomalous arrangement is 
greatly aggravated by the'lowerpart of each column being almost 
always coloured with red or yellow ochre, so as to render the con- 
trast between the two portions still stronger. The architecture of 
Pompeii suffers also from the inferior quality of the materials 
generally employed. No good building stone was at hand; 
and the public as well as private edifices were constructed either 
of volcanic tufa, or lava, or Sarno limestone, or brick (the latter 
only used for the corners of walls). In the private houses even 
the columns are mostly of brick, covered merely with a coat of 
stucco. In a few instances only do we find them making use 
of a whitish limestone wrongly called travertine, which, though 
inferior to the similar material so largely employed at Rome, 
was better adapted than the ordinary tufa for purposes where 
great solidity was required. The portion of the portico sur- 
rounding the forum which was in the process of rebuilding at 
the time when the city was destroyed was constructed of this 
material, while the earlier portions, as well as the principal 
temples that adjoined it, were composed in the ordinary manner 
of volcanic tufa. Marble appears to have been scarce, and 
was sparingly employed. In some instances where it had been 
freely introduced, as in the great theatre, it would seem that the 
slabs must have been removed at a period subsequent to the 
entombment of the city. 

These materials are used in several different styles of con- 
struction belonging to the six different periods which Mau 
traces in the architectural history of Pompeii. 

1 . That of the Doric tempte in the Foro Triangolare (6th century 
B.C.) and an old column built into a house in Region vi., Insula 5; 
also of the older parts of the city walls — date uncertain (Sarno 
limestone and grey tufa). 

2. That of the limestone atriums (outer walls of the houses of 
ashlar-work of Sarno limestone, inner walls with framework of 
limestone blocks, filled in with small pieces of limestone). Date, 
before 200 B.C. 

3. Grey tufa period ; ashlar masonry of tufa, coated with fine white 
stucco; rubble work of lava. The artistic character is still Greek, 
and the period coincides with the first (incrustation) style of mural 
decoration, which (probably originating in Alexandria) aimed at

best-preserved in Pompeii, and extremely fine in conception and 
execution, especially the scenes in which Cupids take part. 



the imitation in stucco of the appearance of a wall veneered with 
coloured marbles. No wall paintings exist, but there are often 
fine floor mosaics. To this belong a number of private houses 
(e.g. the House of the Faun), and the colonnade round the forum, 
the basilica, the temples of Apollo and Jupiter, the large theatre 
with the colonnades of the Foro Triangolare, and the barracks of 
the gladiators, the Stabian baths, the Palaestra, the exterior of 
the Porta Marina, and the interior of the other gates — all the 
public buildings indeed (except the Doric temple mentioned under 
(1), which do not belong to the time of the Roman colony). Date, 
2nd century b.c. 

4. The ' quasi-reticulate " period — walling faced with masonry 
not yet quite so regular as opus reticulatum, and with brick quoins, 
coinciding with the second period of decoration (the architectural, 
partly imitating marble like the first .style, but without relief, 
and by colour only, and partly making use of architectural designs). 
It is represented by the small theatre and the amphitheatre, the 
baths near the forum, the temple of Zeus Milichius, the Comitium 
and the original^ temple of Isis, but only a few private houses. The 
ornamentation is much less rich and beautiful than that of the 
preceding period. Date, from 80 B.C. until nearly the end of the 
Republic. 

5. The period from the last decades of the Republic to the 
earthquake of a.d. 63. No homogeneous series of buildings — we 
find various styles of construction (quasi-reticulate, opus reticulatum 
of tufa with stone quoins, of the time of Augustus, opus reticulatum 
with brick quoins or with mingled stone and brick quoins, a little 
later); and three styles of wall decoration fall within its limits. 
The second, already mentioned, the third or ornate, with its freer 
use of ornament and its introduction of designs which suggest 
an Egyptian origin (originating in the time of Augustus), and the 
fourth or intricate, dating from about a.d. 50. Marble first appears 
as a building material in the temple of Fortuna Augusta (c. 3 B.C.). 

6. The period from the earthquake of a.d. 63 to the final de- 
struction of the city, the buildings of which can easily be recognized. 
The only wholly new edifice of any importance' is the central baths. 

Outside the Porta Ercolanese, or gate leading to Herculaneum, 
is found a house of a different character from all the others, which 
from its extent and arrangements was undoubtedly a suburban 
villa, belonging to a person of considerable fortune. It is c*alled — 
as usual without any authority — the villa of Arrius Diomedes; 
but its remains are of peculiar interest to us, not only for comparison 
with the numerous ruins of similar buildings which occur else- 
where — often of greater extent, but in a much less perfect state 
of preservation — but as assisting us in understanding the description 
of ancient authors, such as Vitruvius and Pliny, of the numerous 
appurtenances frequently annexed to houses of this description. 

In the cellar of this villa were discovered no less than twenty 
skeletons of the unfortunate inhabitants, who had evidently fled 
thither for protection, and fourteen in other parts of the house. 
Almost all the skeletons and remains of bodies found in the city 
were discovered in similar situations, in cellars or underground 
apartments — those who had sought refuge in flight having appar- 
ently for the most part escaped from destruction, or having perished 
under circumstances where their bodies were easily recovered by 
the survivors. According to Cassius Dio, a large number of the 
inhabitants were assembled in the theatre at the time of the catas- 
trophe, but no bodies have been found there, and they were probably 
sought for and removed shortly afterwards. Of late years it has 
been found possible in many cases to take casts of the bodies found — 
a complete mould having been formed around them by the fine 
white ashes, partially consolidated by water. 

An interesting farm-house (few examples have been so far dis- 
covered in Italy) is that at Boscoreale excavated in 1893-1894, 
which contained the treasure of one hundred and three silver vases 
now at the Louvre. The villa of P. Fannius Synhistor, not far off, 
was excavated in 1900; it contained fine wall paintings, which, 
despite their importance, were allowed to be exported, and sold by 
auction in Paris (some now in the Louvre). (See F. Barnabei, 
La Villa pompeiana di P. Fannio Sinistore; Rome, 1901.) 

The road leading from the Porta Ercolanese towards Herculaneum 
is bordered on both sides for a considerable extent by rows of tombs, 
as was the case with all the great roads leading into Rome, and in- 
deed in all large Roman towns. These tombs are in many instances 
monuments of considerable pretension, and of a highly ornamental 
character, and naturally present in the highest degree the peculiar 
advantage common to all that remains of Pompeii, in their perfect 
preservation. Hardly any scene even in this extraordinary city 
is more striking than the coup d'ceil of this long street of tombs, 
preserving uninjured the records of successive generations eighteen 
centuries ago. Unfortunately the names are all otherwise unknown; 
but we learn from the inscriptions that they are for the most part 
those of local magistrates and municipal dignitaries of Pompeii. 
Most of them belong to the early empire. 

There appears to have been in the same quarter a considerable 

suburb, outside the gate, extending on each side of the road towards 

Herculaneum, apparently much resembling those which are now 

found throughout almost the whole distance from thence to 

I Naples. It was known by the name of Pagus Augustus Felix 



56 



POMPEY 



Suburbanus. Other suburbs were situated at the harbour and at 
the saltworks (salinae). 

No manuscripts have been discovered in Pompeii. Inscriptions 
have naturally been found in considerable numbers, and we are 
indebted to them for much information concerning the municipal 
arrangements of the town, as well as the construction of various 
edifices and other public works. The most interesting of these 
are such as are written in the Oscan dialect, which appears to have 
continued in official use down to the time when the Roman colony 
was introduced by Sulla. From that time the Latin language 
was certainly the only one officially employed, though Oscan may 
have still been spoken by a portion at least of the population. 
Still more curious, and almost peculiar to Pompeii, are the numerous 
writings painted upon the walls, which have generally a semi- 
public character, such as recommendations of candidates for muni- 
cipal offices, advertisements, &c, and the scratched inscriptions 
{graffiti), which are generally the mere expression of individual 
impulse and feeling, frequently amatory, and not uncommonly 
conveyed in rude and imperfect verses. In one house also a whole 
box was found filled with written tablets — diptychs and triptychs 
— containing the record of the accounts of a banker named L. 
Caecilius Jucundus.

Oscan Inscriptions. — The surviving inscriptions which can 
be dated, mainly by the gradual changes in their alphabet, are 
of the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C., some certainly belonging to 
the Gracchan period. The oldest of the Latin inscriptions are 
C.I.L. x. 794, the record of the building of colonnades in the 
forum by ' the " quaestor " V. Popidius, and two or three 
election placards (C.I.L. iv. 29, 30, 36) of one R. Caecilius, a 
candidate for the same office. It cannot be an accident that 
the alphabet of these inscriptions belongs distinctly to Sullan 
or pre-Sullan times, while no such officer as a quaestor appears in 
any later documents (e.g. in C.I.L. x. 844, it is the duoviri who 
build the small theatre), but does appear in the Oscan inscrip- 
tions. Hence it has been inferred that these oldest Latin inscrip- 
tions are also older than Sulla's colony; if so, Latin must have 
been in use, and in fairly common use (if the programmaia were 
to be of any service), in Pompeii at that date. On the other 
hand, the good condition of many of the painted Oscan inscrip- 
tions at the times when they were first uncovered (1797 onwards) 
and their subsequent decay and the number of Oscan graffiti 
appear to make it probable that at the Christian era Oscan was 
still spoken in the town. The two languages undoubtedly 
existed side by side during the last century B.C., Latin being 
alone recognized officially and in society, while Oscan was 
preserved mainly by intercourse with the country folk who 
frequented the market. Thus beside many Latin programmaia 
later than those just mentioned we have similar inscriptions 
in Oscan, addressed to Oscan-speaking voters, where IHIner. 
obviously relates to the quattuorvirate, a title characteristic 
of the Sullan and triumviral colonies. An interesting stone 
containing nine cavities for measures of capacity found in 
Pompeii and now preserved in the Naples Museum with Oscan 
inscriptions erased in antiquity shows that the Oscan system of 
measurement was modified so as to correspond more closely with 
the Roman, about 14 B.C., by the duoviri, who record their 
work in a Latin inscription (C.I.L. x. 793; for the Oscan see Hal. 
Dial. p. 67).

POMPEY, the common English form of Pompeius, the name 
of a Roman plebeian family. 

1. Gnaeus Pompeius (106-48 B.C.), the triumvir, the first 
of his family to assume the surname Magnus, was born on the 
30th of September in the same year as Cicero. When only 
seventeen he fought together with his father in the Social War. 



He took the side of Sulla against Marius and Cinna, but for a 
time, in consequence of the success of the Marians, he kept in 
the background. On the return of Sulla from the Mithradatic 
War Pompey joined him with an army of three legions, which 
he had raised in Picenum. Thus early in life he connected 
himself with the cause of the aristocracy, and a decisive victory 
which he won in 83 over the Marian armies gained for him from 
Sulla the title of Imperator. He followed up his successes in 
Italy by defeating the Marians in Sicily and Africa, and on his 
return to Rome in 81, though he was still merely an eques and 
not legally qualified to celebrate a triumph, he was allowed by 
general consent to enjoy this distinction, while Sulla greeted him 
with the surname of Magnus, a title he always retained and 
handed down to his sons. Latterly, his relations with Sulla were 
somewhat strained, but after his death he resisted the attempt of 
the consul M. Aemilius Lepidus to repeal the constitution. In 
conjunction with A. Lutatius Catulus, the other consul, he 
defeated Lepidus when he tried to march upon Rome, and drove 
him out of Italy (77). With some fears and misgivings the 
senate permitted him to retain the command of his victorious 
army, and decided on sending him to Spain, where the Marian 
party, under Sertorius, was still formidable. Pompey was 
fighting in Spain from 76 to 71, and though at first he met with 
serious reverses he was ultimately successful. After Sertorius 
had fallen a victim to assassination, Pompey easily defeated 
his successor Perperna and put an end to the war. In 71 he won 
fresh glory by finally crushing the slave insurrection of Spartacus. 
That same year, amid great popular enthusiasm, but without 
the hearty concurrence of the senate, whom he had alarmed by 
talking of restoring the dreaded power of the tribunes, he was 
elected with M. Licinius Crassus to the consulship, and entered 
Rome in triumph (December 31) for his Spanish victories. 
He was legally ineligible for the consulship,' having held 
none of the lower offices of state and being under age. 
The following year saw the work of Sulla undone; the tribunate 
was restored, and the administration of justice was no longer 
left exclusively to the senate, but was to be shared by it with 
the wealthier portion of the middle class, the equites (q.v.) 
and the Iribuni aerarii. 1 The change was really necessary, as 
the provincials could never get justice from a court composed 
of senators, and it was carried into effect by Pompey with 
Caesar's aid. Pompey rose still higher in popularity, and 
on the motion of the tribune Aulus Gabinius in 67 he was 
entrusted with an extraordinary command over the greater 
part of the empire, specially for the extermination of piracy in 
the Mediterranean, by which the corn supplies of Rome were 
seriously endangered, while the high prices of provisions caused 
great distress. He was completely successful; the price of corn 
fell immediately on his appointment, and in forty days the 
Mediterranean was cleared of the pirates. Next year, on the 
proposal of the tribune Manilius, his powers were still further 
extended, the care of all the provinces in the East being put 
under his control for three years together with the conduct of 
the war against Mithradates VI., who had recovered from the 
defeats he had sustained from Lucullus and regained his 
dorninions. Both Caesar and Cicero supported the tribune's 
proposal, which was easily carried in spite of the interested 
opposition of the senate and the aristocracy, several of whom 
held provinces which would now be practically under Pompey's 
command. The result of Pompey 's operations was eminently 
satisfactory. The wild tribes of the Caucasus were cowed by 
the Roman arms, and Mithradates himself fled across the 
Black Sea to Panticapaeum (modern Kertch). In the years 
64 and 6s Syria and Palestine were annexed to Rome's empire. 
After the capture of Jerusalem Pompey is said to have entered 
the Temple, and even the Holy of Holies. Asia and the East 
generally were left under the subjection of petty kings who were 
mere vassals of Rome. Several cities had been founded, which 
became centres of Greek life and civilization. 

Pompey, now in his forty-fifth year, returned to Italy in 61 to 

1 Their history and political character is obscure ; they were at any 
rate connected with the knights (see Aerarium).

celebrate the most magnificent triumph which Rome had ever 
witnessed, as the conqueror of Spain, Africa, and Asia (sec A. 
Holm, Hist, of Greece , Eng. trans., vol. iv.). This triumph marked 
the turning-point of his career. As a soldier everything had 
gone well with him; as a politician he was a failure. He found 
a great change in public opinion, and the people indifferent to 
his achievements abroad. The optimates resented the extra- 
ordinary powers that had been conferred upon him; Lucullus 
and Crassus considered that they had been robbed by him of 
the honour of concluding the war against Mithradatcs. The 
senate refused to ratify the arrangements he made in Asia or 
to provide money and lands for distribution amongst his 
veterans. In these circumstances he drew closer to Caesar on 
his return from Spain, and became reconciled to Crassus. The 
result was the so-called first triumvirate (see Rome: History). 

The remainder of his life is inextricably interwoven with that 
of Caesar. He was married to Caesar's daughter Julia, and as 
yet the relations between the two had been friendly. On more 
than one occasion Caesar had supported Pompey's policy, 
which of late had been in a decidedly democratic direction. 
Pompey was now in fact ruler of the greater part of the empire, 
while Caesar had only the two provinces of Gaul. The control 
of the capital, the supreme command of the army in Italy and 
of the Mediterranean fleet, the governorship of the two Spains, 
the superintendence of the corn supplies, which were mainly 
drawn from Sicily and Africa, and on which the vast population 
of Rome was wholly dependent, were entirely in the hands of 
Pompey, who was gradually losing the confidence of all political 
parties in Rome. The senate and the aristocracy disliked and 
distrusted him, but they felt that, should things come to the 
worst, they might still find in him a champion of their cause. 
Hence the joint rule of Pompey and Caesar was not unwillingly 
accepted, and anything tike a rupture between the two was 
greatly dreaded as the sure beginning of anarchy throughout the 
Roman world. With the deaths of Pompey's wife Julia (54) and 
of Crassus (53) the relations between him and Caesar became 
strained, and soon afterwards he drew closer to what we may 
call the old conservative party in the senate and aristocracy. 
The end was now near, and Pompey blundered into a false 
political position and an open quarrel with Caesar. In 50 the 
senate by a very large majority revoked the extraordinary 
powers conceded to Pompey and Caesar in Spain and Gaul 
respectively, and called upon them to disband their armies. 
Pompey's refusal to submit gave Caesar a good pretext for 
declaring war and marching at the head of his army into 
Italy. At the beginning of the contest the advantages were 
decidedly on the side of Pompey, but the superior political 
tact of his rival, combined with extraordinary promptitude and 
decision in following up his blows, soon turned the scale against 
him. Pompey's cause, with that of the senate and aristocracy, 
was finally ruined by his defeat in 48 in the neighbourhood of the 
Thessatian city Pharsalus. That same year he fled with the 
hope of finding a safe refuge in Egypt, but was treacherously 
murdered by one of his old centurions as he was landing. He 
was five times married, and three of his children survived him — 
Gnaeus, Sextus, and a daughter Pompeia. 

Pompey, though he had some great and good qualities, 
hardly deserved his surname of " the Great." He was certainly 
a very good soldier, and is said to have excelled in all athletic 
exercises, hut he fell short of being a first-rate general. He 
won great successes in Spain and more especially in the East, 
but for these he was no doubt partly indebted to what others had 
already done. Of the gifts which make a good statesman he 
had really none. As plainly appeared in the last years of his 
life, he was too weak and irresolute to choose a side and stand 
by it. But to his credit be it said that in a corrupt time he 
never used his opportunities for plunder and extortion, and 
his domestic life was pure and simple.

2. Gnaeus Pompeius, surnamed Strabo (squint-eyed), 
Roman statesman, father of the triumvir. He was successively 
quaestor in Sardinia (103 B.C.), praetor (94), propraetor in 
Sicily (93) and consul (89). He fought with success in the 
Social War, and was awarded a triumph for his services. 
Probably towards the end of the same year he brought forward 
the law {lex Pompeia de Gallia Transpadana), which conferred 
upon the inhabitants of that region the privileges granted to 
the Latin colonies. During the civil war between Marius and 
Sulla he seems to have shown no desire to attach himself 
definitely to either side. He certainly set out for Rome from the 
south of Italy (where he remained as proconsul) at the bidding 
of the aristocratic party, when the city was threatened by 
Marius and Cinna, but he displayed little energy, and the engage- 
ment which he fought before the Colline gate, although hotly 
contested, was indecisive. Soon afterwards he was killed by 
lightning (87). Although he possessed great military talents, 
Pompeius was the best-hated general of his time -owing to his 
cruelty, avarice and perfidy. His body was dragged from the 
bier, while being conveyed to the funeral pile, and treated with 
the greatest indignity.

3. Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (c. 75-45 B.C.), the elder son of 
the triumvir. In 48 B.C. during the civil war he commanded 
his father's fleet in the Adriatic. After the battle of Pharsalus 
he set out for Africa with the remainder of the Pompeian party, 
but, meeting with little success, crossed over to Spain. Having 
been joined by his brother Sextus, he collected a considerable 
army, the numbers of which were increased by the Pompeians 
who fled from Africa after the battle of Thapsus (46). Caesar, 
who regarded him as a formidable opponent, set out against 
him in person. A battle took place at Munda on the 17th of 
March 45, in which the brothers were defeated. Gnaeus' 
managed to make his escape after the engagement, but was 
soon (April 12) captured and put to death. He was generally 
unpopular owing to his cruelty and violent temper. 

See Pseudo-Opphis, Bellum hispaniense, 1-39; Lucan, Pharsalia, 
ix. 1 20 ; Dio Cassius xliii. 28-40. 

4. Sextus Pompeius Magnus (75-35 B.C.), the younger son 
of the triumvir. After his father's death he continued the 
struggle against the new rulers of the Roman Empire. From 
Cyprus, where he had taken refuge, he made his way to Africa, 
and after the defeat of the Pompeians at Thapsus (46) crossed 
over to Spain. After Caesar's victory at the battle of Munda 
(45), in which he took no actual part, he abandoned Corduba 
(Cordova), though for a time he held his ground in the south, 
and defeated Asinius Pollio, the governor of the province. In 
43, the year of the triumvirate of Octavius, Antony, and 
Lepidus, he was proscribed along with the murderers of Caesar, 
and, not daring to show himself in Italy, he put himself at the 
head of a fleet manned chiefly by slaves or proscribed persons, 
with which he made himself master of Sicily, and from thence 
ravaged the coasts of Italy. Rome was threatened with a 
famine, as the corn supplies from Egypt and Africa were cut 
off by his ships, and it was thought prudent to negotiate a peace 
with him at Misenum (39), which was to leave him in possession 
of Sicily, Sardinia and Achaea, provided he would allow Italy 
to be freely supplied with corn. But the arrangement could 
not be carried into effect, as Sextus renewed the war and gained 
some considerable successes at sea. However, in ^6 his fleet 
was defeated and destroyed by Agrippa at Naulochus off the 
north coast of Sicily. After his defeat he fled to Mytilene, and 
from there to Asia Minor. In the attempt to make his way to 
Armenia he was taken prisoner by Antony's troops, and put to 
death at Miletus. Like his father, he was a brave soldier, but 
a man of little culture.

128, 129, 131; Cicero, Philippica, xiii., and many references in 
Letters to Atticus. 

POMPIGNAN, JEAN JACQUES LEFRANC, Marquis de (1709- 
1784), French poet, was born on the 17th of August 1709, at 
Montauban, where his father was president of the cour d t es aides, 
and the son, who also followed the profession of the law, suc- 
ceeded in 1745 to the same charge. The same year he was also 
appointed conseiller d'honneur of the parlcment of Toulouse, 
but his courageous opposition to the abuses of the royal power, 
especially in, the matter of taxation, brought down upon him 
so much vexation that he resigned his positions almost immedi- 
ately, his marriage with a rich woman enabling him to devote 
himself to literature. His first play, Didon (1734), which owed 
much to Metastases opera on the same subject, gained a great 
success, and gave rise to expectations not fulfilled by the Adieux 
de Mars (1735) and some light operas that followed. His reputa- 
tion was made by Poesies sacries et philosophiques (1734), much 
mocked at by Voltaire who punned on the title: " Sacris Us 
sonl, car personne n'y louche. 17 Lefranc's odes on profane sub- 
jects hardly reach the same level, with the exception of the ode 
on the death of J. B. Rousseau, which secured him entrance to 
the Academy (1760). On his reception he made an ill-con- 
sidered oration violently attacking the Encyclopaedists, many 
of whom were in his audience and had given him their votes. 
Lefranc soon had reason to repent of his rashness, for the 
epigrams and stories circulated by those whom he had attacked 
made it impossible for him to remain in Paris, and he took 
refuge in his native town, where he spent the rest of his life 
occupied in making numerous translations from the classics, 
none of great merit. 

La Harpe, who is severe enough on Lefranc in his correspondence, 
does his abilities full justice in his Cours litteraire, and ranks him 
next to J. B. Rousseau among French lyric poets. With those 
of other 18th-century poets his works may be studied in the Petits 
pobtes frangais (1838) of M. Prosper Poitevin. His (Euvres com- 
pletes (4 vols.) were published in 1781, selections (2 vols.) in 1800, 
1813, 1822. 

His brother, Jean Georges Lefranc de Pompignan (1715- 
1790), was the archbishop of Vienne against whose defence of 
the faith Voltaire launched the good-natured mockery of Les 
Lettres d J un Quaker. Elected to the Estates General, he passed 
over to the Liberal side, and led the 149 members of the clergy 
who united with the third estate to form the National Assembly. 
He was one of its first presidents, and was minister of public 
worship when the civil constitution was forced upon the clergy. 

POMPONAZZI, PIETRO (Petrus Pomponatius) (1462-1525), 
Italian philosopher, was born at Mantua on the 16th of Sep- 
tember 1462, and died at Bologna on the 18th of May 1525. His 
education, begun at Mantua, was completed at Padua, where he 
became doctor of medicine in 1487. In 1488 he was elected 
extraordinary professor of philosophy at Padua, where he was 
a colleague of Achillini, the Averroist. From about 1495 to 
1509 he occupied the chair of natural philosophy until the 
closing of the schools of Padua, when he took a professorship 
at Ferrara where he lectured on the De anima. In 151 2 he 
was invited to Bologna where he remained till his death and 
where he produced all his important works. The predominance 
of medical science at Padua had cramped his energies, but at 
Ferrara, and even more at Bologna, the study of psychology 
and theological speculation were more important. In 1516 he 
produced his great work De immortalitate anitni, which gave 
rise to a storm of controversy between the orthodox Thomists 
of^ the Catholic Church, the Averroists headed by Agostino 
Nifo, and the so-called Alexandrist School. The treatise was 
burned at Venice, and Pomponazzi himself ran serious risk of 
death at the hands of the Catholics. Two pamphlets followed, 
the Apologia and the Defensorium, wherein he explained his 
paradoxical position as Catholic and philosophic materialist. 
His last two treatises, the De incanlationibus and the De fato, 
were posthumously published in an edition of his works printed 
at Basel. 



Pomponazzi is profoundly interesting as the herald of the 
Renaissance. He was born in the period of transition when 
scholastic formalism was losing its hold over men both in the 
Church and outside. Hitherto the dogma of the Church had 
been based on Aristotle as interpreted by Thomas Aquinas. 
So close was this identification that any attack on Aristotle, or 
even an attempt to reopen the old discussions on the Aristo- 
telian problems, was regarded as a dangerous heresy. Pom- 
ponazzi claimed the right to study Aristotle for himself, and 
devoted himself to the De anima with the view of showing that 
Thomas Aquinas had entirely misconceived the Aristotelian 
theory of the active and the passive intellect. The Averroists had 
to some extent anticipated this attitude by their contention that 
immortality does not imply the eternal separate existence of 
the individual soul, that the active principle which is common 
to all men alone survives. Pomponazzi's revolt went further 
than this. He held, with Alexander of Aprodisias, that, as 
the soul is the form of the body (as Aquinas also asserted), it 
must, by hypothesis, perish with the body; form apart from 
matter is unthinkable. The ethical consequence of such a 
view is important, and in radical contrast to the practice of the 
period. Virtue can no longer be viewed solely in relation to 
reward and punishment in another existence. A new sanction 
is required. Pomponazzi found this criterion in rod kolXov evem 
-—virtue for its own sake. " Praemium essentiale virtutis est 
ipsamet virtus quae hominem felicem facit," he says in the De 
immortalitate. Consequently, whether or not the soul be im- 
mortal, the ethical criterion remains the same: " Neque aliquo 
pacto declinandum est a virtute quicquid accidat post mortem." 
In spite of this philosophical materialism, Pomponazzi declared 
his adherence to the Catholic faith, and thus established the 
principle that religion and philosophy, faith and knowledge, 
may be diametrically opposed and yet coexist for the same 
thinker. This curious paradox he exemplifies in the De incanta- 
tione y where in one breath he sums up against the existence 
of demons and spirits on the basis of the Aristotelian theory of 
the cosmos, and, as a believing Christian, asserts his faith in 
their existence. In this work he insists emphatically upon the 
orderly sequence of nature, cause and effect. Men grow to 
maturity and then decay; so- religions have their day and 
succumb. Even Christianity, he added (with the usual proviso 
that he is speaking as a philosopher) was showing indications 
of decline.

POMPONIUS, LUCIUS, called Bononiensis from his birthplace 
Bononia, Latin comic poet, flourished about 90 B.C. (or earlier). 
He was the first to give an artistic form to the Atellanae 
Fabulae by arranging beforehand the details of the plot which 
had hitherto been left to improvisation, and providing a written 
text. The fragments show fondness for alliteration and playing 
upon words, skill in the use of rustic and farcical language, 
and a considerable amount of obscenity.

POMPOSA, an abbey of Emilia, Italy, in the province of 
Ferrara, 2 m. from Codigoro, which is 30 m. E. of Ferrara in the 
delta of the Po. The fine church, a work of the 10th (?) century, 
with interesting sculptures on the facade and a splendid Roma- 
nesque campanile, contains a good mosaic pavement, and interest- 
ing frescoes of the 14th century — a " Last Judgment " of the 
school of Giotto and others; and there are also paintings in the 
refectory. It was abandoned in 1550 on account of malaria.

POMPTINE MARSHES, a low tract of land in the province of 
Rome, Italy, varying in breadth between the Volscian mountains 
and the sea from 10 to 16 m., and extending N.W. to S.E. from 



PONANI— PONCHIELLI

Vcllctri to Terracina (40 m.). In ancient days this low tract 
was fertile and well-cultivated, and contained several prosperous 
cities (Suessa Pometia, Ulubrac — perhaps the mod. Cisterna — 
&c), but, owing to the dying out of the small proprietors, it 
had already become unhealthy at the end of the Republican 
period. Attempts to drain the marshes were made by Appius 
Claudius in 312 B.C., when he constructed the Via Appia through 
them (the road having previously followed a devious course at 
the foot of the Volscian mountains), and at various times 
during the Roman period. A canal ran through them parallel 
to the road, and for some reason that is not altogether clear it 
was used in preference to the road during the Augustan period. 
Trajan repaired the road, and Thcodoric did the same some 
four hundred years later. But in the middle ages it had fallen 
into disrepair. Popes Boniface VIII., Martin V., Sixtus V., 
and Pius VI. all attempted to solve the problem, the last-named 
reconstructing the road admirably. The difficulty arises from 
the lack of fall in the soil, some parts no less than 10 m. from 
the coast being barely above sea-level, while they are separated 
from the sea by a series of sand-hills now covered with forest, 
which rise at some points over 100 ft. above sea-level. Springs 
also rise in the district, and the problem is further complicated 
by the flood-water and solid matter brought down by the 
mountain torrents, which choke up the channels made. By 
a law passed in 1899, the proprietors are bound to arrange for 
the safe outlet of the water from the mountains, keep the exist- 
ing canals open, and reclaim the district exposed to inundation, 
within a period of twenty-four years. The sum of £280,000 has 
been granted towards the expense by the government.

PONANI, a seaport on the west coast of India, in Malabar 
district, Madras, at a mouth of a river of the same name. Pop. 
(iqoi), 10,562. It is the headquarters of the Moplah or Map- 
pilla community of Mahommedans, with a religious college and 
many mosques, one of which is said to date from 1510. There 
is a large export of coco-nut products. 

PONCA, a tribe of North-American Indians of Siouan stock. 
They were originally part of the Omaha tribe, with whom they 
lived near the Red River of the North. They were driven 
westward by the Dakotas, and halted on the Ponca river, 
Dakota. After a succession of treaties and removals they were 
placed on a reservation at the mouth of the Niobrara, where 
they were prospering, when their lands were forcibly taken from 
them, and they were removed to Indian Territory (Oklahoma). 
During the march thither and in their new quarters, the tribe's 
health suffered, so that in 1878 they revolted and made their 
way back to the Omahas. They were recaptured, but public 
attention having been drawn to their hard case they were 
liberated in 1880, after a long trial, which resulted in their 
being declared United States citizens. They number some 
700, mostly in Oklahoma. 

PONCE, a seaport and the second largest city of Porto Rico, 
the seat of government of the Department of Ponce, on the 
south coast, about 50 m. (84 m. by the military road) S.W. of San 
Juan. Pop. (1899), 27,952, of whom 2554 were negroes and 
9942 of mixed races; (1910X35,027. It is served bytheAmerican 
Railroad of Porto Rico, by a railway to Guayama (1910), and by 
steamboats from numerous ports; an old military road connects 
it with San Juan. Ponce consists of two parts: Ponce, or the 
city proper, and Ponce Playa, or the seaport ; they are separated 
by the Portuguese River and ate connected by an electric street 
railway. Ponce Playa is on a spacious bay and is accessible to 
vessels drawing 25 ft. of water; Ponce is 2 m. inland at the 
interior margin of a beautiful plain, with hills in the rear rising 
to a height of 1000 to 2000 ft. The city is supplied with water 
by an aqueduct about 2 m. long. There are two attractive 
public squares in the heart of the city: Plaza Principal and Plaza 
de las Delicias. Among prominent public buildings are the 
city hall, the custom-house, the Pearl theatre, several churches — 
Roman Catholic (including a finely decorated cathedral) and 
Protestant; St Luke's hospital and insane asylum, an asylum 



for the blind, a ladies' asylum, a home for the indigent and 
aged, and a military barracks. At the Quintana Baths near the 
city are thermal springs with medicinal properties. The 
surrounding country is devoted chiefly to the cultivation of 
sugar cane, tobacco, oranges and cacao, and to the grazing of 
cattle. Among the manufactures are sugar, molasses, rum, 
and ice, and prepared coffee for the market. Ponce, named in 
honour of Ponce de Leon, was founded in 1752 upon the site of 
a settlement which had been established in the preceding century, 
was incorporated as a town in 1848, and was made a city in 
1878. 

PONCELET, JEAN VICTOR (1788-1*867), French mathe- 
matician and engineer, was born at Metz on the 1st of July 
1788. From 1808 to 1810 he attended the £cole poly technique, 
and afterwards, till 181 2, the £cole & application at Metz. He 
then became lieutenant of engineers, and took part in the 
Russian campaign, during which he was taken prisoner and was 
confined at Saratov on the Volga. It was during his imprison- 
ment here that, " prive* de toute espece de livres et de secours, 
surtout distrait par les malheurs de ma patrie et les miens 
propres," as he himself puts it, he began his researches on pro- 
jective geometry which led to his great treatise on that subject. 
This work, the Traill des proprieties project ives des figures, which 
was published in 1822 (2d ed., 2 vols. 186 5-1 866), is occupied 
with the investigation of the projective properties of figures (see 
Geometry). This work entitles Poncelet to rank as one of the 
greatest of those who took part in the development of the 
modern geometry of which G. Monge was the founder. From 
181 5 to 1825 he was occupied with military engineering at 
Metz: and from 1825 to 1835 he was professor of mechanics at 
the Ecole d } application there. In 1826, in his Mimoire sur les 
roues hydrauliques a aubes courbes, he brought forward im- 
provements in the construction of water-wheels, which more 
than doubled their efficiency. In 1834 he became a member of 
the Acadimie; from 1838 to 1848 he was professor to the 
faculty of sciences at Paris, and from 1848 to 1850 comman- 
dant of the £cole polylechnique. At the London International 
Exhibition of 1851 he had charge of the department of 
machinery, and wrote a report on the machinery and tools on 
view at that exhibition. He died at Paris on the 23rd of 
December 1867. 

See J. Bertrand, tXoge historique de Poncelet (Paris, 1875). 

PONCHER, 6TIENNE DE (1446-1524), French prelate and 
diplomatist. After studying law he was early provided with 
a prebend, and became councillor at the parlement of Paris 
in 1485 and president of the Chambre des Enquetes in 1498. 
Elected bishop of Paris in 1503 at the instance of Louis XII., 
he was entrusted by the king with diplomatic missions in 
Germany and Italy. After being appointed chancellor of the 
duchy of Milan, he became keeper of the seals of France in 151 2, 
and retained that post until the accession of Francis I., who 
employed him on various diplomatic missions. Poncher 
became archbishop of Sens in 1519. His valuable Constitutions 
synodales was published in 1514. 

PONCHIELLI, AMILCARE (1834-1886), Italian musical 
composer, was born near Cremona on the 1st of September 1834. 
He studied at the Milan Conservatoire. His first dramatic 
work, written in collaboration with two other composers, was 
// Sindaco Babbco (1851). After completing his studies at 
Milan he returned to Cremona, where his opera / Promcssi 
sposi was produced in 1856. This was followed by La Savojarda 
(186 1, produced in a revised version as Lina in 1877), Roderigo, 
re del Goti (1864), and La Stella del monte (1867). A revised 
version of / Promessi sposi, which was produced at Milan in 
1872, was his first genuine success. After this came a ballet, 
Le Due Gemelle (1873), and an opera, / Lituani (1874, produced 
in a revised version as Alduna in 1884). Ponchielli reached the 
zenith of his fame with La Gioconda (1876), written to a libretto 
founded by Arrigo Boito upon Victor Hugo's tragedy, Angela, 
Tyran de Padouc. La Gioconda was followed by // Figliuol 
prodigo (1880) and Marion Delorme (1885). Among his less

PONCHO— PONIARD 



important works are II Parlatore eterno, a musical farce (1873), 
and a ballet, Clarina (1873). In r88i Ponchielli was made 
maestro di cappella of Piacenza Cathedral. His music shows 
the influence of Verdi, but at its best it has a distinct value of 
its own, and an inexhaustible flow of typically Italian melody. 
His fondness for fanciful figures in his accompaniments has 
been slavishly imitated by Mascagni, Leoncavallo, and many of 
their contemporaries. Ponchielli died at Milan on the 17 th 
of January 1886. 

PONCHO (a South American Spanish word, adopted from the 
Araucanian poncho or pontho in the 17th century), a form of 
cloak worn originally by the South American Indians, and 
afterwards adopted by the Spaniards living in South America. 
It is merely a long strip "of cloth, doubled, with a hole for the 
head. 

POND, JOHN (c. 1767-1836), English astronomer-royal, was 
born about 1767 in London, where his father made a fortune 
in trade. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, at the age 
of sixteen, but took no degree, his course being interrupted by 
severe pulmonary attacks which compelled a long residence 
abroad. In 1800 he settled at Westbury near Bristol, and 
began to determine star -places with a fine altitude and azimuth 
circle of 25 ft. diameter by E. Troughton. His demonstration 
in 1806 (Phil. Trans, xcvi. 420) of a change of form in the 
Greenwich mural quadrant led to the introduction of astro- 
nomical circles at the Royal Observatory, and to his own appoint- 
ment as its head. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society 
on the 26th of February 1807; he married and went to live in 
London in the same year, and in 181 1 succeeded Maskelyne as 
astronomer-royal. 

During an administration of nearly twenty-five years Pond 
effected a reform of practical astronomy in England comparable 
to that effected by Bessel in Germany. In 182 r he began to 
employ the method of observation by reflection; and in 1825 
he devised means (see Mem. Roy. Astron. Soc. ii. 499) of combin- 
ing two mural circles in the determination of the place of a single 
object, the one serving for direct and the other for reflected 
vision. Under his auspices the instrumental equipment at 
Greenwich was completely changed, and the number of assis- 
tants increased from one to six. The superior accuracy of his 
determinations was attested by S. C. Chandler's discussion of 
them in 1894, in the course of his researches into the variation 
of latitude (Astron. J own. Nos. 313, 315). He persistently con- 
troverted (i8io-r824) the reality of J. Brinkley's imaginary 
star-parallaxes (Phil. Trans, cviii. 477, cxiii. 53). Delicacy of 
health compelled his retirement in the autumn of 1835. He 
died at Blackheath on the 7th of September 1836, and was 
buried beside Halley in the churchyard of Lee. The Copley 
medal was conferred upon him in 1823, and the Lalande prize 
in 181 7 by the Paris Academy, of which he was a corresponding 
member. He published eight folio volumes of Greenwich 
Observations, translated Laplace's Systhme du monde (in 2 vols. 
8vo., 1809), and contributed thirty-one papers to scientific 
collections. His catalogue of nr2 stars (1833) was of great 
value.

POND, a small pool or body of standing water, a word often 
applied to one for which the bed has been artificially constructed. 
The word is a variant of " pound *' (q.v.), an enclosure. 

PONDICHERRY, the capital of the French possessions in 
India, situated on the Coromandel or western coast, 122 m. by 
rail S. of Madras. The territory, which is entirely surrounded 
by the British district of South Arcot, has an area of 115 sq. m. 
with a population (1901) of 174,456. The chief crops are dry 
grains, rice, earth-nuts and a little indigo. The territory is 
traversed by a branch of the South Indian railway from Villa- 
puram. The town has a population of 27,448. It is well laid 



out with fine public buildings; the water-supply is derived from 
artesian wells. It has an open roadstead, with a small iron 
pier. The port is visited yearly by 500 vessels, and has trade 
of the value of about some £r, 300,000. The principal imports 
are areca-nuts, wines and liqueurs, and the chief exports ground- 
nuts, oil, cotton fabrics and rice. Of the export trade more 
than one-half is with France, but of the import trade only one- 
fourth. The weaving of various fabrics forms the principal 
industry. 

Pondicherry was founded in 1683 by Francois Martin, on the 
site of a village given him by the governor of Gingee, In 1693 
the Dutch took Pondicherry, but restored it, with the fortifica- 
tions greatly improved, in 1697, at the peace of Ryswick. In 
1748 Admiral Boscawen laid siege to. it without success, but in 
1 761 it was taken by Colonel Coote from Lally. In 1763 it 
was restored to the French. In 1778 it was again taken by 
Sir Hector Munro, and its fortifications destroyed. In 1783 
it was retransferred to the French, and in 1793 recaptured by 
the English. The treaty of Amiens in 1802 restored it to the 
French, but it was retaken in 1803. In 1816 it was finally 
restored to the French. 

PONDO, a Kaffir people who have given their name to Pondo- 
land,.the country comprising much of the seaboard of Kaffraria, 
Cape province, immediately to the south-west of Natal. The 
Pondo, who number about 200,000, are divided into several 
tribal groups, but the native government, since the annexation 
of the country to Cape Colony in 1894, has been subject to the 
control of the colonial authorities. (See Kaffirs.) 

PONDWEED, a popular name for Potamogeton natans y a 
cosmopolitan aquatic plant found in ponds, lakes and ditches, 
with broad, more or less oblong-ovate, olive-green, floating 
leaves. The name is also applied to other species of Potamo- 
geton, one of the characteristic genera of lakes, ponds and streams 
all over the world, but more abundant in temperate regions. 
It is the principal genus of the natural order of Monocotyledous 
Potamogetonaceae, and contains plants with slender branched 
stems, and submerged and translucent, or floating and opaque, 
alternate or opposite leaves, often with membranous united 
stipules. The small flowers are borne above the water in

axillary or terminal spikes; they have four stamens, which bear 
at the back four small herbaceous petal-like structures, and 
four free carpels, which ripen to form four small green fleshy 
fruits, each containing one seed within a hard inner coat; 
the seed contains a large hooked embryo. An allied genus 
Zannichellia (named after Zanichelli, a Venetian botanist), 
occurring in fresh and brackish ditches and pools in Britain, 
and also widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions, 
is known as horned pondweed, from the curved fruit.

PONIATOWSKI, the name of a Polish princely family of 
Italian origin, tracing descent from Giuseppe Torclli, who 
married about 1650 an heiress of the Lithuanian family of 
Poniator, whose name he assumed. 

The first of the Poniatowskis to distinguish himself was 
Stanislaus Poniatowski (1677-1762), who only belonged to 
the family by adoption, being the reputed son of Prince Sapieha 
and a Jewess. He was born at Dercczyn in Lithuania, and was 
adopted by Sapieha's intendant, Poniatowski. With his father 
he attached himself to the party of Stanislaus Leszczynski, and 
became major-general in the army of Charles XII. of Sweden. 
After the defeat of Pultowa he conveyed Charles XII. across 
the Dnieper, and remained with him at Bender. From there 
he was sent to Constantinople, where he extracted from the 
sultan Achmet III. a promise to march to Moscow. When the 
grand vizier, Baltagi Mehemet, permitted the tsar Peter I. to 
retreat unharmed from the banks of the Pruth, Poniatowski 
exposed his treason. He rejoined Leszczynski in the duchy 
of Zweibriickcn, Bavaria, of which he became governor. 
After the death of Charles XII. in 1718 he visited Sweden; 
and was subsequently reconciled with Leszczynski's rival on 
the throne of Poland, Augustus II., who made him grand 
treasurer of Lithuania in 1724. On the death of Augustus II. 
he tried to secure the reinstatement of Leszczynski, who then 
resumed his claims to the Polish crown. He was taken prisoner 
at Danzig by the Russians, and presently gave his allegiance 
to Augustus III., by whom he was made governor of Cracow. 
He died at Ryki on the 3rd of August 1762. 

His second son Stanislaus Augustus became king of Poland 
(see Stanislaus II.). Of the other sons, Casimir (1 721-1780) 
was his brother's chancellor; Andrew (1735-1773) entered the 
Austrian service, rising to the rank of feldzeugmeister; and 
Michael (1 736-1 794) became archbishop of Gnesen and primate 
of Poland. Joseph Anthony Poniatowski (q.v.), son of Andrew, 
became one of Napoleon's marshals. 

Stanislaus Poniatowski (1757-1833), son of Casimir, 
shared in the aggrandisement of the family during the reign of 
Stanislaus II., becoming grand treasurer of Lithuania, starost 
of Podolia and lieutenant-general of the royal army. In 1793 
he settled in Vienna, and subsequently in Rome, where he made 
a magnificent collection of antique gems in his house on the 
Via Flaminia. This collection was sold at Christie's in London 
in May 1839. He died in Florence on the 13th of February 
i%33y and with him the Polish and Austrian honours became 
extinct. 

His natural, but recognized, son, Joseph Michael Xavter 
Francis John Poniatowski (1816-1873), was born at Rome 
and in 1847 was naturalized as a Tuscan subject. He received 
the title of prince in Tuscany (1847) and in Austria (1850). 
He had studied music under. Ceccherini at Florence, and wrote 
numerous operas, in the first of which, Giovanni di Procida, 
he sang the title r61e himself at Lucca in 1838. He represented 
the court of Tuscany in Paris from 1848, and he was made a 
senator by Napoleon III., whom he followed to England in 
1871. His last opera, Gelmina, was produced at Covent Garden 
in 1872. He died on the 3rd of July 1873, and was buried at 
Chislehurst. His son, Prince Stanislaus Augustus, married and 
settled in Paris. He was equerry to Napoleon III., and died 
in January 1908. 

PONIATOWSKI, JOSEPH ANTHONY (1763-1813),^ Polish 
prince and marshal of France, son of Andrew Poniatowskfand the 
countess Theresa Kinsky, was born at Warsaw in 1763. Adopt- 
ing a military career, he joined the Imperial army when Austria 
declared war against the Turks in 1788, and distinguished 
himself at the storming of Sabac on the 25th of April, where 
he was seriously wounded. Recalled by his uncle King Stanis- 
laus when the Polish army was reorganized, he received the rank 
of major-general, and subsequently that of lieutenant-general, 
and devoted himself zealously to the improvement of the 



national forces. In 1789, when Poland was threatened by the 
armed intervention of Russia, he was appointed commander of 
the Ukraine division at Braclaw on Bug. After the proclama- 
tion of the constitution of the 3rd of May 1791 he was 
appointed commander-in-chief, with instructions to guard the 
banks of the Dniester and Dnieper. On the outbreak of the 
war with Russia, Prince Joseph, aided by Kosciuszko, displayed 
great ability. Obliged constantly to retreat, but disputing 
every point of vantage, he turned on the pursuer whenever 
he pressed too closely, and won several notable victories. At 
Polonna the Russians were repulsed with the loss of 3000 men; 
at Dubienka the line of the Bug was defended for five days 
against fourfold odds; at Zielence the Poles won a still more 
signal victory. Finally the Polish arms converged upon Warsaw, 
and were preparing for a general engagement when a courier 
from the capital informed the generals that the king had acceded 
to the confederation of Targowica (see Poland: History) and 
had at the same time guaranteed the adhesion of the army. 
All hostilities were therefore to be suspended. After an indig- 
nant but fruitless protest, Poniatowski and most of the other 
generals threw up. their commissions and emigrated. During 
the Kosciuszko rising he again fought gallantly for his country 
under his former subordinate, and after the fall of the republic 
resided as a private citizen at Warsaw for the next ten years. 
After Jena and the evacuation of the Polish provinces by 
Prussia, Poniatowski was offered the command of the National 
Guard; he set about reorganizing the Polish army, and on the 
creation of the grand duchy of Warsaw was nominated war 
minister. During the war of 1809, when an Austrian army 
corps under the archduke Ferdinand invaded the grand duchy, 
Poniatowski encountered them at the bloody battle of Radzyn, 
and though compelled to abandon Warsaw ultimately forced 
the enemy to evacuate the grand duchy, and captured Cracow. 
In Napoleon's campaign against Russia in 181 2 Poniatowski 
commanded the fifth army corps; and after the disastrous 
retreat of the grand army, when many of the Poles began to waver 
in their allegiance to Napoleon, Poniatowski remained faithful 
and formed a new Polish army of 13,000 men with which he 
joined the emperor at Liitzen. In the campaign of 181 3 he 
guarded the passes of the Bohemian mountains and defended 
the left bank of the Elbe. As a reward for his brilliant services 
at the three days' battle of Leipzig he was made a marshal of 
France and entrusted with the honourable but dangerous duty 
of covering the retreat of the army. Poniatowski heroically 
defended Leipzig, losing half his corps in the attempt, finally 
falling back slowly upon the bridge over the Elster which the 
French in the general confusion blew up before he reached it. 
Contesting every step with the overwhelming forces of the 
pursuers, he refused to surrender, and covered with wounds 
plunged into the river, where he died fighting to the last. His 
relics were conveyed to Poland and buried in Cracow Cathedral,

PONS, JEAN LOUIS (1761-1831), French astronomer, was 
born at Peyres (Hautcs Alpes) on the 24th of December 1761. 
He entered the Marseilles observatory in 1789, and in 181 9 
became the director of the new observatory at Marlia near 
Lucca, which he left in r825 for the observatory of the museum 
at Florence. Here he died on the 14th of October 1831. 
Between 1801 and 1827 Pons discovered thirty-seven comets, one 
of which (observed on the 26th of November 1818) was named 
after J. F. Encke, who determined its remarkably short period.

PONSARD— PONTANUS 



PONSARD, FRANCOIS (1814-1867), French dramatist, was 
born at Vienne, department of Isere, on the 1st of June 18 14. 
He was bred a lawyer, and his first performance in literature 
was a translation of Manfred (1837). His play Lucrece was 
represented at the Thedire Franqais on the 1st of April 1843. 
This date is a kind of epoch in literature and dramatic 
history, because it marked a reaction against the romantic 
style of Dumas and Hugo. He received in 1845 the prize 
awarded by the Academy for a tragedy " to oppose a dike to 
the waves of romanticism." Ponsard adopted the liberty of 
the romantics with regard to the unities of time and place, but 
he reverted to the more sober style of earlier French drama. 
The tastes and capacities of the greatest tragic actress of the 
day, Rachel, suited his methods, and this contributed greatly 
to his own popularity. He followed up Liwrbce with Agnes de 
Meranie (1846), Charlotte Corday (1850), and others. Ponsard 
accepted the empire, though with no very great enthusiasm, 
and received the post of librarian to the senate, which, however, 
he soon resigned, fighting a bloodless duel with a journalist on 
the subject. UHonneur et Vargent^ one of his most successful 
plays, was acted in 1853, and he became an Academician in 
1855. For some years he did little, but in 1866 he obtained 
great success with Le Lion atnoureux, another play dealing with 
the revolutionary epoch. His Galitte, which excited great 
opposition in the clerical camp, was produced early in 1867. 
He died in Paris on the 7th of July of the same year, soon after 
his nomination to the commandership of the Legion of Honour. 
Most of Ponsard's plays hold a certain steady level of literary 
and dramatic ability, but his popularity is in the main due to 
the fact that his appearance coincided with a certain public 
weariness of the extravagant and unequal style of 1830. 

His CEuvres completes were published in Paris (3 vols., 1865- 
1876). See La Fin du tkidtre romantique et Francois Ponsard d'apres 
des documents inidits (1899), by C. Latreille. 

PONSONBY, JOHN (1713-1789), Irish politician, second son 
of Brabazon Ponsonby, 1st earl of Bessborough, was born on 
the 29th of March 1713. In 1739 he entered the Irish parliament 
and in 1744 he became first commissioner of the revenue; in 
1746 he was appointed a privy councillor, and in 1756 Speaker 
of the Irish House of Commons. Belonging to one of the great 
families which at this time monopolized the government of 
Ireland, Ponsonby was one of the principal " undertakers," men 
who controlled the whole of the king's business in Ireland, and 
he retained the chief authority until the marquess Townshend 
became lord-lieutenant in 1767. Then followed a struggle 
for supremacy between the Ponsonby faction and the party 
dependent on Townshend, one result of this being that Ponsonby 
resigned the speakership in 1771. He died on the 12th of 
December 1789. His wife was Elizabeth, daughter of William 
Cavendish, 3rd duke of Devonshire, a connexion which was of 
great importance to the Ponsonbys. 

Ponsonby's third son, George Ponsonby (1755-1817), lord 
chancellor of Ireland, was born on the 5th of March 1755 and 
was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, A barrister, he 
became a member of the Irish parliament in 1776 and was 
chancellor of the Irish exchequer in 1782, afterwards taking 
a prominent part in the debates on the question of Roman 
Catholic relief, and leading the opposition to the union of the 
parliaments. After 1800 Ponsonby represented Wicklow and 
then Tavistock in the united parliament; in 1806 he was lord 
chancellor of Ireland, and from 1808 to 18 17 he was the official 
leader of the opposition in the House of Commons. He left an 
only daughter when he died in London on the 8th of July 1817. 

George Ponsonby's elder brother, William Brabazon 
Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby (1 744-1806), was also a leading 
Whig politician, being a member of the Irish, and after 1800, of 
the British parliament. In 1806 shortly before his death he 
was created Baron Ponsonby of Imokilly. Three of his sons 
were men of note. The eldest was John (c. 1 770-1855), who 
succeeded to the barony and was created a viscount in 1839; 
he was ambassador at Constantinople from 1832 to 1837 and 
at Vienna from 1846 to 1850. The second son was Major- 



General Sir William Ponsonby (1772-1815), who, after serving 
in the Peninsular War, was killed at the battle of Waterloo 
whilst leading a brigade of heavy cavalry. Another son was 
Richard Ponsonby (1 772-1853), bishop of Derry. Sir William 
Ponsonby's posthumous son William (1816-1861) became 3rd 
Baron Ponsonby on the death of his uncle John, Viscount 
Ponsonby; he died childless and was succeeded by his cousin 
William Brabazon Ponsonby (1807-1866), only son of the bishop 
of Derry, on whose death the barony of Ponsonby became extinct. 

Among other members of this family may be mentioned Major- 
General Sir Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby (1783-1837), son of 
the 3rd earl of Bessborough, a soldier who distinguished himself 
at the battles of Talavera, Salamanca and Vittoria, in the 
Peninsular War, and was wounded at Waterloo; he was governor 
of Malta from 1826 to 1835. His eldest son, Sir Henry Frederick 
Ponsonby (1825-1895), a soldier who served in the Crimea, is 
best remembered as private secretary to Queen Victoria from 
1870 until a few months before his death. 

PONSON DU TERR AIL [Pierre Alexis de Ponson], 
Vicomte de (1820-187 1), French romance writer, was born at 
Montmaur (Isere) on the 8th of July 1829. He was a prolific 
novelist, producing in the space of two years some seventy- 
three volumes. Among his most successful productions were 
Les Coulisses du monde (1853), Exploits de Rocambole (1859), 
Les Drames de Paris (1865) and Le Forger on de la Cottr-Dieu 
(1869). He died at Bordeaux on the 20th of January 1871. 

PONT (or Kylpont), R0BERT<(i524-i6o6), Scottish reformer, 
was educated at St Andrews. In 1562 he was appointed 
minister at Dunblane and then at Dunkeld; in 1563, commis- 
sioner for Moray, Inverness and Banff. Then in succession 
he became minister of Birnie (1567), provost of Trinity College 
near Edinburgh (i57i),a lord of session (1572), minister of St 
Cuthbert's, Edinburgh (1573) and at St Andrews (1581). Pont 
was a strenuous champion of ecclesiastical independence, and 
for protesting against parliamentary interference in church 
government he was obliged to leave his country. From 1584 
to 1586 he was in England, but returning north he resumed his 
prominence in church matters and kept it until his death in 
1606. His elder son Timothy Pont (i56o?-i6i4?) was a good 
mathematician, surveyor, and " the first projector of a Scottish 
atlas." 

PONTA DELGADA, the capital of an administrative district, 
comprising the islands of St Michael's and St Mary in the 
Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. Pop. (1900), 17,620. 
Ponta Delgada is built on the south coast of St Michael's, in 
37 40' N. and 25 36' W. Its mild climate, and the fine scenery 
of its mountain background, render it very attractive to visitors; 
it is the commercial centre, and the most populous city of the 
archipelago. Besides the cathedral, it contains several inter- 
esting churches and monasteries, and an observatory. Formerly 
its natural inner harbour only admitted vessels of light draught, 
while larger ships were compelled to anchor in an open road- 
stead, which was inaccessible during the prevalence of southerly 
gales. But great improvements were effected after i860 by 
the construction of a breakwater 2800 ft. long. 

PONT-A-MOUSSON, a town of northern France in the depart- 
ment of Meurthe-et-Moselle, 17 m. N.N.W. of Nancy by rail. 
Pop. (1906), 12,282. The Moselle, which is canalized, divides 
the town into two quarters, united by a bridge of the late 16th 
century. The church of St Martin, dating from the 13th, 14th 
and 15th centuries, has a handsome facade with two towers, 
and in the interior a choir screen and Holy Sepulchre of the 1 5th 
century. The lower ecclesiastical seminary occupies the build- 
ing of an old Premonstratensian convent. There are several 
interesting old houses. The town has a communal college and 
engineering workshops, blast furnaces, and manufactures of 
lacquered ware, paper, cardboard, cables and iron- ware. Dating 
from the 9th or 10th century, Pont-a-Mousson constituted a 
lordship, which was made a marquisate in 1354. It was from 
1572 to 1763 the seat of a well-known university. 

PONTANUS, JOVIANUS (1426-1503), Italian humanist and 
poet, was born in 1426 at Cerreto in the duchy of Spoleto, 



PONTARLIER— PONTECOULANT

where his father was murdered in one of the frequent civil 
brawls which then disturbed the peace of Italian towns. His 
mother escaped with the boy to Perugia, and it was here that 
Pontano received his first instruction in languages and literature. 
Tailing to recover his patrimony, he abandoned Umbria, and 
at the age of twenty-two established himself at Naples, which 
continued to be his chief place of residence during a long and 
prosperous career. He here began a close friendship with the 
distinguished scholar, Antonio Beccadelli, through whose in- 
fluence he gained admission to the royal chancery of Alphonso 
the Magnanimous. Alphonso discerned the singular gifts of 
the young scholar, and made him tutor to his sons. Pontano's 
connexion with the Aragonese dynasty as political adviser, 
military secretary and chancellor was henceforth a close one; 
and the most doubtful passage in his diplomatic career is when 
he welcomed Charles VIII. of France upon the entry of that king 
into Naples in 1495, thus showing that he was too ready to 
abandon the princes upon whose generosity his fortunes had been 
raised. Pontano illustrates in a marked manner the position 
of power to which men of letters and learning had arrived in 
Italy. He entered Naples as a penniless scholar. He was 
almost immediately made the companion and trusted friend of 
its sovereign, loaded with honours, lodged in a fine house, 
enrolled among the nobles of the realm, enriched, and placed at 
the very height of social importance. Following the example of 
Pomponio Leto in Rome and of Cosimo de' Medici at Florence, 
Pontano founded an academy for the meetings of learned and 
distinguished men. This became the centre of fashion as well 
as of erudition in the southern capital, and subsisted long after 
its founder's death. In 1461 he married his first wife, Adriana 
Sassone, who bore him one son and three daughters before her 
death in 1491. Nothing distinguished Pontano more than the 
strength of his domestic feeling. He was passionately attached 
to his wife and children; and, while his friend Beccadelli signed 
the licentious verses of Hcrmapkroditus, his own Muse celebrated 
in liberal but loyal strains the pleasures of conjugal affection, 
the charm of infancy and the sorrows of a husband and a father 
in the loss of those he loved. Not long after the death of his 
first wife Pontano took in second marriage a beautiful girl of 
Ferrara, who is only known to us under the name of Stella. 
Although he was at least sixty-five years of age at this period, 
his poetic faculty displayed itself with more than usual warmth 
and lustre in the glowing series of elegies, styled Eridanus, 
which he poured forth to commemorate the rapture of this 
union. Stella's one child, Lucilio, survived his birth but fifty 
days; nor did his mother long remain to comfort the scholar's 
old age. Pontano had already lost his only son by the first 
marriage; therefore his declining years were solitary. He died 
in 1503 at Naples, where a remarkable group of terra-cotta 
figures, life-sized and painted, still adorns his tomb in the church 
of Monte Oliveto. He is there represented together with his 
patron Alphonso and his friend Sannazzaro in adoration before 
the dead Christ. 

As a diplomatist and state official Pontano played a part of 
some importance in the affairs of southern Italy and in the 
Barons' War, the wars with Rome, and the expulsion and restora- 
tion of the Aragonese dynasty. But his chief claim upon the 
attentions of posterity is as a scholar. His writings divide 
themselves into dissertations upon such topics as the " Liberality 
of Princes " or " Ferocity," composed in the rhetorical style of 
the day, and poems. He was distinguished for energy of Latin 
style, for vigorous intellectual powers, and for the faculty, rare 
among his contemporaries, of expressing the facts of modern 
life, the actualities of personal emotion, in language sufficiently 
classical yet always characteristic of the man. His prose 
treatises are more useful to students of manners than the similar 
lucubrations of Poggio. Yet it was principally as a Latin poet 
that he exhibited his full strength. An ambitious didactic 
composition in hexameters, entitled Urania, embodying the 
astronomical science of the age, and adorning this high theme 
with brilliant mythological episodes, won the admiration of 
Italy. It still remains a monument of fertile invention, 



exuberant facility and energetic handling of material. Not less 
excellent is the didactic poem on orange trees, De horiis Hesperi- 
dam. His most original compositions in verse, however, are 
elegiac and hendecasyllabic pieces on personal topics— the De 
conjugali amore, Eridanus, Tumuli, Naeniae, Baiac, &c. — in 
which he uttered his vehemently passionate emotions with a 
warmth of southern colouring, an evident sincerity, and a truth 
of painting from reality which excuse their erotic freedom. 

Pontano's prose and poems were printed by the Aldi at Venice.

1871); for his place in the history of literature, Symonds, Renais- 
sance in Italy. (]. A. S.) 

PONTARLIER, a frontier town of eastern France, capital of 
an arrondissement in the department of Doubs, 36 m. S.E. of 
Besancon by road. Pop. (1006), 7896. It is situated 2750 ft. 
above sea-level on the Doubs, about four miles from the Swiss 
frontier, and forms an important strategic point at the mouth 
of the defile of La Cluse, one of the principal passes across the 
Jura. The pass is defended by the modern fort of Larmont, 
and by the Fort de Joux, which was originally built in the 10th 
century by the family of Joux and played a conspicuous part 
in the history of Franche-Comte. Pontarlier is the junction 
of railway lines to Neuchatel, Lausanne, Lons-le-Saunier, D61e 
and Besancon. A triumphal arch of the 18th century com- 
memorates the reconstruction of the town after the destructive 
fire of 1736. It was at Pontarlier that the French army of the 
East made its last stand against the Prussians in 187 1 before 
crossing the Swiss frontier. The distillation of herbs, extensively 
cultivated for the manufacture of absinthe, kirsch and other 
liqueurs, is the chief industry. The town is the seat of a sub- 
prefect and has a tribunal of first instance and a communal 
college. 

PONT AUDEMER, a town of north-western France, capital 
of an arrondissement in the department of Eure, 39 m. N.W. 
of Evreux, on the Risle, a left-bank affluent of the Seine, and 
on the railway from Evreux to Honfleur. Pop. (1906), 5700. 
The church of St Ouen, which has fine stained glass of the 
16th century, combines the late Gothic and Renaissance styles; 
its choir is Romanesque. Local institutions are the sub-prefec- 
ture, a tribunal of first instance, a board of trade-arbitration, a 
chamber and tribunal of commerce. Manufacturing industry 
is active, and includes the founding of malleable metal, a spur 
factory, the manufacture of glue and paper, cotton-spinning 
and various branches of leather manufacture. There is trade 
in flax, wool, grain, cattle, cider, paper, iron, wood and coal. 
The port has a length of over half a mile on the Risle, wbich is 
navigable for small vessels from this point to its mouth (10 m.). 
The town owes its name to Audomar, a Frank lord, who in 
the 7th or 8th century built a bridge over the Risle at this point. 
It was the scene of several provincial ecclesiastical councils in 
tbe 12th and 13th centuries and of meetings of the estates of 
Normandy in the 13th century. 

PONTE (Ital. for " bridge "), a rough game peculiar to the 
city of Pisa, in which the players, divided into two sides 
and provided with padded costumes, contended for the 
possession of one of the bridges over the Amo. The weapon 
used, both for offence and defence, was a kind of shield which 
served as a club as well. 

A history and description of the game may be found in William 
Heywood's Palio and Ponte (London, 1904). 

PONTECORVO, a city of Campania, Italy, in the province of 
Caserta, on the Garigliano, about 48 m. from Caserta and 3 m. 
from Aquino on the railway from Rome to Naples. Pop. (1001), 
10,518 (town); 12,492 (commune). The town is approached by 
a triumphal arch adorned with a statue of Pius IX. The princi- 
pality of Pontecorvo (about 40 sq. m. in extent), once an indepen- 
dent state, belonged alternately to the Tomacelli and the abbots 
of Monte Cassino. Napoleon bestowed it on Bernadotte in 1806, 
and in i8ioit was incorporated with the French Empire. 

PONTECOULANT, LOUIS GUSTAVE LE DOULCET, Comte 
de ( 1 764-1853), French politician, was born at Caen on the 17th 
of November 1764. He began a career in the army in 1778.

PONTEFRACT 



A moderate supporter of the revolution, he was returned to the 
Convention for the department of Calvados in 1792, and became 
commissary with the army of the North. He voted for the 
imprisonment of Louis XVI. during the war, and his banishment 
after the peace. He then attached himself to the party of the 
Gironde/and in August 1793 was outlawed. He had refused to 
defend his compatriot Charlotte Corday, who wrote him a letter 
of reproach on her way to the scaffold. He returned to the 
Convention on the 8th of March 1 795, and showed an unusual 
spirit of moderation by defending Prieur de la Marne and Robert 
Lindet. President of the Convention in July 1795, he was for 
some months a member of the council of public safety. He 
was subsequently elected to the council of five hundred, but was 
suspected of royalist leanings, and had to spend some time in 
retirement before the establishment of the consulate. Becoming 
senator in 1805, and count of the empire in 1808, he organized 
the national guard in Franche Comte in 1811, and the defence 
of the north-eastern frontier in 1813. At the first restoration 
Louis XVIII. made him a peer of France, and although he 
received a similar honour from Napoleon during the Hundred 
Days, he sat in the upper house under the Second Restoration. 
He died in Paris on the 3rd of April 1853, leaving memoirs and 
correspondence from which were extracted four volumes (1861- 
1865) of Souvenirs historiques ei parlementaires 1764-1848. 

His son Louis Adolphe Le Doulcet, comte de Pontecoulant 
(1 794-1882), served under Napoleon in 181 2 and 1814, and then 
emigrated to Brazil, where he took part in the abortive insurrec- 
tion at Pernambuco in 181 7. He also organized a French 
volunteer contingent in the Belgian revolution of 1830, and was 
wounded at Louvain. The rest of his life was spent in Paris 
in the study of ancient music and acoustics. Among his works 
was one on the Musie instrumental du conservatoire de musique 
(1864). A younger brother, Philippe Gustave Le Doulcet, 
comte de Pontecoulant (1795-1874), served in the army until 
1849, when he retired to devote himself to mathematics and 
astronomy. His works include Thiorie analytique du systeme 
du monde (Paris, 18 29-1 846) and TraiU ilementaire de physique 
cileste (2 vols., Paris, 1840). 

PONTEFRACT (pronounced and sometimes written " Pom- 
fret *'), a market town and municipal and parliamentary borough 
in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, 21 m. S.S.W. from 
York, served by the Midland, North-Eastern and Lancashire & 
Yorkshire railways. Pop. (1891), 9702; (1901), 13,427- It is 
well situated, mainly on an eminence, near the junction of the 
Aire and the Calder. The most important of the antiquarian 
remains are the ruins of the famous castle situated on a rocky 
height, originally covering with its precincts an area of over 
8 acres, and containing in all eight round towers. The remains 
are principally of Norman date, and an unusual feature of the 
stronghold is the existence of various subterranean chambers in 
the rock. Below the castle is All Saints church, which suffered 
severely during the siege of the castle, but still retains some work 
of the 1 2th century. In 1837 the tower and transepts were 
fitted for divine service. The church of St Giles, formerly a 
chapel of ease to All Saints, but made parochial in the 18th 
century, is of Norman date, but most of the present structure 
is modern. The 17th-century spire was removed in 1707, and 
replaced by a square tower, which was rebuilt in 1797; the chan- 
cel was rebuilt in 1869. In Southgate is an ancient hermitage 
and oratory cut out of the solid rock, which dates from 1396. 
On St Thomas's Hill, where Thomas, earl of Lancaster, was 
beheaded in 1322, a chantry was erected in 1373, the site of 
which is now occupied by a windmill built of its stones. At 
Monkhill there are the remains of a Tudor building called the 
Old Hall, probably constructed out of the old priory of St John's. 
A grammar school of ancient foundation, renewed by Elizabeth 
and George III., occupies modern buildings. The town-hall 
was built at the close of the 18th century on the site of one 
erected in 1656, which succeeded the old moot -hall dating from 
Saxon times. Among other buildings are the court house, the 
market hall, the assembly rooms (a handsome building adjoining 
the town-ball), and large barracks. The foundation of the 



principal almshouse, that of St Nicholas, dates from before the 
Conquest. Trinity Hospital was founded by Sir Robert Knolles 
(d. 1407), an eminent military commander in the French wars 
of Edward III. At Ackworth, in the neighbourhood, there is a 
large school of the Society of Friends or Quakers (1778), in the 
foundation of which Dr John Fothergill (17 12-1780) was a prime 
mover. There are extensive gardens and nurseries in the 
neighbourhood of Pontefract, and liquorice is largely grown 
for the manufacture of the celebrated Pomfret cakes. The 
town possesses ironfoundries, sack and matting manufactories, 
tanneries, breweries, corn mills and brick and terra-cotta works. 
The parliamentary borough, falling within the Osgoldcross 
division of the county, returns one member (before 1885 the 
number was two). The town is governed by a mayor, six alder- 
men and 18 councillors. Area, 4078 acres. 

The remains of a Roman camp have been discovered near 
Pontefract, but there is no trace of settlement in the town itself 
until after the Conquest. At the time of the Domesday Survey 
Tateshall (now Tanshelf, a suburb of the town) was the chief 
manor and contained 60 burgesses, while Kirkby, which after- 
wards became the borough of Pontefract, was one of its members. 
The change was probably owing to the fact that Ilbert de Lacy, 
to whom the Conqueror had granted the whole of the honour of 
Pontefract, founded a castle at Kirkby, on a site said to have 
been occupied by a fortification raised by Ailric, a Saxon thane. 
Several reasons are given for the change of name but none is at 
all satisfactory. One account -says that it was caused by a 
broken bridge which delayed the Conqueror's advance to the 
north, but this is known to have been at Ferrybridge, three 
miles away; a second says that the new name was derived from 
a Norman town called Pontfrete, which, however, never existed; 
and a third that it was caused by the breaking of a bridge in 
1 1 53 on the arrival of the archbishop of York, St William, when 
several people were miraculously preserved from drowning, 
although the town was already known as Pontefract in 1140 
when Archbishop Thurstan died there. The manor remained 
in the Lacy family until it passed by marriage to Thomas, duke 
of Lancaster, who was beheaded on a hill outside the town after 
the battle of Boroughbridge. His estates were restored to his 
brother Henry, earl of Lancaster, on the accession of Edward III., 
and the manor has since then formed part of the duchy of 
Lancaster. The town took part in most of the rebellions in the 
north of England, and in 1399 Richard II. was imprisoned and 
secretly murdered in the castle. During the Wars of the Roses 
the town was loyal to Henry VI., and several of the Yorkist 
leaders were executed here after the battle of Wakefield. It was- 
taken by Robert Aske, leader of the Pilgrimage of Grace, in 
1536. In 1642 the castle was garrisoned for Charles I. and 
sustained four sieges, the second, in 1644^ being successful, 
but two years later it was retaken by the royalists, who held it 
until after the execution of the king, when they surrendered to 
General Lambert and the castle was destroyed. 

Roger de Lacy in 1194 granted a charter to the burgesses 
confirming their liberties and right to be a free borough at a 
fee-farm of i2d. yearly for every toft, granting them the same 
privileges as the burgesses of Grimsby, and that their reeve 
should be chosen annually by the lord of the manor at his court 
leet, preference being given to the burgesses if they would pay 
as much as others for the office. Henry de Lacy cofirmed this 
charter in 1278 and in 1484 Richard III. incorporated the town 
under the title of mayor and burgesses and granted a gild 
merchant with a hanse. His charter was withdrawn on the 
accession of Henry VII. and a similar one was granted, while in 
1489 the king gave the burgesses licence to continue choosing a 
mayor as they had done in the time of Richard III. In 1 606-1 607 
James I. confirmed the charter of Henry VII. and regulated the 
choice of the mayor by providing that he should be elected from 
among the chief burgesses by the burgesses themselves. The 
privilege of returning two members to parliament which had 
belonged to Pontefract at the end of the 13th century was revived 
in 1620-1621 on the grounds that the charter of 1606-1607 
had restored all their privileges to the burgesses. Since the

the market rights in the borough to the burgesses, who still 
hold them under his charter.

PONTEVEDRA, a maritime province of north-western Spain, 
formed in 1833 of districts taken from Galicia, and bounded 
on the N. by Corunna, E. by Lugo and Orense, S. by Portugal 
and \V. by the Atlantic. Pop. (1900), 457,262; area, 1695 sq. m. 
Pontevcdra is the smallest of the provinces of Spain except 
the three Basque Provinces; its density of population, 269-8 
inhabitants per square mile, is only excelled in the provinces of 
Barcelona and Biscay (Vizcaya). Both of these are mining 
and manufacturing districts, while Pontevedra is dependent 
on agriculture and fisheries. The surface is everywhere moun- 
tainous, and consists almost entirely of arable land, pasture or 
forest. The coast-line is deeply indented; navigation is rendered 
difficult by the prevalence of fogs in summer and storms in 
winter. The river Miiio (Portuguese Minho) forms the southern 
frontier, and is navigable by small ships as far as Salvatierra; 
and the province is watered by many smaller streams, all flowing, 
like the Miiio, into the Atlantic. The largest of these are the 
Ulla, which separates Pontevcdra from Corunna, the Umia and 
the Lerez. Pontevedra has a mild climate, a fertile soil and a 
very heavy rainfall. Large agricultural fairs are held in the 
chief towns, and there is a considerable export trade in cattle 
to Great Britain and Portugal, hams, salt meat and fish, eggs, 
breadstuffs, leather and wine. Vigo is the headquarters of 
shipping, and one of the chief ports of northern Spain. There 
are also good harbours at Bayona, Carril, Marin, Villagarcia and 
elsewhere among the deep estuaries of the coast. At Tuy the 
Spanish and Portuguese railways meet, and from this town one 
line goes up the Mino valley to Orense, and another northward 
along the coast to Santiago de Compostela. 

PONTEVEDRA, the capital of the Spanish province of Ponte- 
vedra; on the Tuy-Corunna railway, and on the river Lerez, 
which here enters the Ria de Pontevedra, an inlet of the Atlantic. 
Pop. (1000), 22,330. The name of the town is derived from the 
ancient Roman bridge (pons veins) of twelve arches, which spans 
the Lerez near its mouth. Pontevedra is a picturesque town, 
mainly built of granite, and still partly enclosed by medieval 
fortifications. It contains handsome provincial and municipal 
halls erected in the 19th century, and many convents, some of 
which have been converted into hospitals or schools. Marin and 
Sangenjo are ports on the Ria de Pontevedra, which is the seat 
of a thriving sardine fishery. There is an active trade in grain, 
wine and fruit; cloth, hats, leather and pottery are manufactured. 

PONTIAC (c. 1 7 20-1 769), Indian chief of the Ottawa and 
leader in the " Conspiracy of Pontiac " in 1763-64, was born 
between 1712 and 1720 probably on the Maumee river, near the 
mouth of the Auglaize. His father was an Ottawa, and his 
mother an Ojibwa. By 1755 he had become a chief of the 
Ottawa and a leader of the loose confederacy of the Ottawa, 
Potawatomi #nd Ojibwa. He was an ally of France and 
possibly commanded the Ottawa in the defeat (July 9, 1755) of 
General Edward Brad dock. In November 1760 he met Major 
Robert Rogers, then on his way to occupy Michilimackinac and 
other forts surrendered by the French, and agreed to let the 
English troops pass unmolested on condition that he should be 
treated with respect by the British. Like other Indians he soon 
realized the difference between French and English rule — that 
the Indians were no longer welcomed at the forts and that they 
would ultimately be deprived of their hunting grounds by en- 
croaching English settlements. French hunters and traders 
encouraged Indian disaffection with vague promises of help from 
France; in 1762 an Indian "prophet" among the Dclawares 
on the Muskingum preached a union of the Indians to expel the 
xxn. 3 



English; and in that year (as in 1761) there were abortive con- 
spiracies to massacre the English garrisons of Detroit, Fort 
Niagara and Fort Pitt (now Pittsburg). Pontiac seems to have 
been chief of a magic association (the Metai), and he took advan- 
tage of the religious fervour and the general* unrest among the 
Indians to organize in the winter *of 1762-63 a simultaneous 
attack on the English forts to be made in May 1763 at a certain 
phase of the moon. On the 27th of April 1763, before a meeting 
near Detroit of delegates from most of the Algonquian tribes, he 
outlined his plans. On the 7th of May, with 60 warriors, he 
attempted unsuccessfully to gain admission to Detroit, which 
then had a garrison of about 160 under Major Henry Gladwin 
(1 730-1 791); and then besieged the fort from the 9th of May to 
the end of October. On the 28th of May reinforcements from 
Fort Niagara were ambuscaded near the mouth of the Detroit. 
In June the Wyandot and Potawatomi withdrew from the siege, 
but on the 29th of July they attacked reinforcements (280 men, 
including 20 of Rogers's rangers) from Fort Niagara under 
Captain James Dalyell (or Dalzell), who, however, gained the 
fort, and in spite of Gladwin's opposition on the 31st of July 
attacked Pontiac's camp, but was ambuscaded on Bloody Run 
and was killed, nearly 60 others being killed or wounded. On 
the 1 2th of October the Potawatomi, Ojibwa and Wyandot made 
peace with the English; with the Ottawa Pontiac continued the 
siege until the 30th of October, when he learned from Neyon 
de la Valliere, commandant of Fort Chartres (among the Illinois) 
that he would not be aided by the French. Pontiac then 
withdrew to the Maumee. 

Fort Pitt with a garrison of 330 men under Captain Simeon 
Ecuyer was attacked on the 22nd of June and was besieged 
from the 27th of July to the 1st of August, when the Indians 
withdrew to meet a relief expedition of 500 men, mostly High- 
landers, under Colonel Henry Bouquet (1710-1766), who had 
set out from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on the 18th of July, and 
relieved Fort Ligonier (on the site of the borough of Ligonier, 
Westmoreland county, Penn.) on the 2nd of August, but 
was surprised on the 5th, and fought (5th and 6th) the battle 
of Bushy Run (25 m. S.E. of Fort Pitt), finally flanking and 
routing the Indians after tricking them by a feinted retreat of 
a part of his force. Bouquet reached Fort Pitt on the 10th 
of August. At Michilimackinac (Mackinac), Michigan, on the 
4th of June, the Indians gained admission to the fort by a trick, 
killed nearly a score of the garrison and captured the remainder, 
including Captain George Etherington, the commander, besides 
several English traders, including Alexander Henry (1 730-1 824) .' 
Some of the captives were seized by the Ottawa, who had taken 
no part in the attack; a part of these were released, and reached 
Montreal on the 13th of August. Seven of the prisoners kept 
by the Ojibwa were killed in cold blood by one of their chiefs. 
Fort Sandusky (on the site of Sandusky, Ohio) was taken on the 
1 6th of May by Wyandot; and Fort St Joseph (on the site of the 
present Niles, Mich.) was captured on the 25th of May and n 
men (out of its garrison of 14) were massacred, the others with the 
commandant, Ensign Schlosser, being taken to Detroit and 
exchanged for Indian prisoners. On the 27th of May Fort 
Miami (on the site of Fort Wayne, Indiana) surrendered to the 
Indians after its commander, Ensign Holmes, had been treacher- 
ously killed. Fort Ouiatanon (about 5 m. south-west of the present 
Lafayette, Indiana) and Fort Presque Isle (on the site of Erie, 
Penn.) were taken by the Indians on the 1st and 16th of 
June respectively; and Fort Le Boeuf (on the site of Waterford, 

1 Henry, a native of New Brunswick, N.J., had become a fur- 
trader at Fort Michilimackinac in 1761. He was rescued by 
Wawatam, an Ottawa, who had adopted him as a brother; in 1764 
he took part in Colonel John Bradstreet's expedition; in 1770, with 
Sir William Johnson, the duke of Gloucester and others, formed a 
Company to mine copper in the Lake Superior region; was a fur- 
trader again until 1796; and then became a merchant in Montreal. 
His Travels and Adventures in Canada and the Indian Territories 
between the Years 1760 and 1776 (1809; reprinted 1901) is a valuable 
account of the fur trade and of his adventures at Michilimackinac. 
He is not to be confused with his nephew of the same name, also a 
fur-trader, whose journal was published in 1897 in 3 vols., as New 
Light on the Early History oj the Greater Northwest.

Penn.) was surprised on the 18th, but its garrison escaped, 
and seven (out of 13) got safely to Fort Pitt Fort Venango 
(near the site of the present Venango, Penn.) was taken 
and burnt about the same time by some Senecas (the only 
Iroquois in the conspiracy), who massacred the garrison and 
later burned the commander, Lieut. Gordon. About 500 
Senecas on the 14th of September surprised a wagon train, 
escorted by 24 soldiers, from Fort Schlosser (2 m. above Niagara 
Falls), drove most of them over the brink of the Devil's Hole 
(below the cataract), and then nearly annihilated a party from 
Fort Niagara sent to tbe rescue. 

In 1763, although the main attacks on Detroit and Fort Pitt 
had failed, nearly every minor fort attacked was captured, 
about 200 settlers and traders were killed, and in property 
destroyed or plundered the English lost about £100,000, the 
greatest loss in men and property being in western Pennsylvania. 

In June 1764 Colonel John Bradstreet (1711-1774) led about 
1200 men from Albany to Fort Niagara, where at a great gather- 
ing of the Indians several treaties were made in July; in August 
he made at Presque Isle a treaty (afterwards annulled by 
General Thomas Gage) with some Delaware and Shawnee chiefs; 
and in September made treaties (both unsatisfactory) with the 
Wyandot, Ottawa and Miami at Sandusky, and with various 
chiefs at Detroit. He sent Captain Howard to occupy the forts 
at Michilimackinac, Green Bay and Sault Ste Marie, and Captain 
Morris up the Maumee river, where he conferred with Pontiac, 
and then to Fort Miami, where he narrowly escaped death at 
tbe hands of the Miami; and with his men Bradstreet returned 
to Oswego in November, having accomplished little of value. 
An expedition of 1500 men under Colonel Bouquet left Carlisle, 
Pennsylvania, in August, and near the site of the present 
Tuscarawas, Ohio, induced the Indians to release their prisoners 
and to stop fighting — the practical end of the conspiracy. 
Pontiac himself made submission to Sir William Johnson on the 
25th of July 1766 at Oswego, New York. In April 1769 he was 
murdered, when drunk, at Cahokia (nearly opposite St Louis) 
by a Kaskaskia Indian bribed by an English trader; and he was 
buried near the St Louis Fort. His death occasioned a bitter 
war in which a remnant of the Illinois was practically annihilated 
in 1770 at Starved Rock (between the present Ottawa and La 
Salle), Illinois, by the Potawatomi, who had been followers of 
Pontiac. Pontiac was one of the most remarkable men of the 
Indian race in American history, and was notable in particular 
*for his power (rare among the Indians) of organization.

1851; 10th ed., 1896). 

PONTIAC, a city and the county-seat of Oakland county, 
Michigan, U.S.A., on the Clinton river, about 26 m. N.W. of 
Detroit. Pop. (1890), 6200; (1900) 9769, of whom 2020 were 
foreign-born; (1910U.S. census) 14,532. It is served by the Grand 
Trunk and the Pontiac, Oxford & Northern railways (being the 
southern terminus of the latter), and by the Detroit & Pontiac 
and the North-Western electric inter-urban lines. In the sur- 
rounding country there are many small, picturesque lakes (the 
largest being Orchard, about 6 m. south-east of Pontiac, Cass 
and Elizabeth lakes), and there is good hunting and fishing in 
the vicinity. In- Pontiac is the Eastern Michigan Asylum for 
the insane (1878), with grounds covering more than 500 acres. 
The city has various manufactures, and the value of the factory 
products increased from $2,470,887 in 1900 to $3,047,422 in 
1904, or 23-3%. Agricultural products, fruit and wool from 
the surrounding country are shipped in considerable quantities. 
The municipality owns and operates its waterworks. Pontiac, 
named in honour of the famous Indian chief of that name, was 
laid out as a town in 181 8, became the county-seat in 1820, was 
incorporated as a village in 1837, and was chartered in 1861. 

PONTIANUS, pope from 230 to 235. He was exiled by the 
emperor Maximinus to Sardinia, and in consequence of this sen- 
tence resigned (Sept. 28, 235). He was succeeded by Anteros. 

PONTIFEX. The collegium of the Pontifices was the most 
important priesthood of ancient Rome, being specially charged 
with the administration of the jus divinum, i.e. that part of the 



civil law which regulated the relations of the community with 
the deities recognized by the state officially, together with a 
general superintendence of the worship of gens and family. 
The name is clearly derived from pons and jacerc, but whether 
this should be taken as indicating any special connexion with the 
sacred bridge over the Tiber {Pons Sublicius), or what the original 
meaning may have been, cannot now be determined. The 
college existed under the monarchy, when its members were 
probably three in number; they may- safely be considered as 
legal advisers of the rex in all matters of religion. Under the 
republic tbey emerge into prominence under a pontifex maximus, 
who took over the king's duties as chief administrator of religious 
law, just as his chief sacrificial duties were taken by the rex 
sacrorum; his dwelling was the regia, "the house of the king." 
During the republican period the number of pontifices increased, 
probably by multiples of three, until after Sulla (82 B.C.) wc 
find them fifteen; for the year 57 B.C. we have a complete list 
of them in Cicero (Harusp. resp. 6, 12). Included in the 
collegium were also the rex sacrorum, the flamines, three assistant 
pontifices (minores), and the vestal virgins, who were all chosen 
by the pontifex maximus. Vacancies in the body of pontifices 
were originally filled by co-optation; but from the second Punic 
War onwards the pontifex maximus was chosen by a peculiar 
form of popular election, and in the last age of the republic this 
held good for all the members. They all held office for life. 

The immense authority of the college centred in the pontifex 
maximus, the other pontifices forming his consilium or advising 
body. His functions were partly sacrificial or ritualistic, but 
these were the least important; the real power lay in the adminis- 
tration of the jus divinum, the chief departments of which may 
briefly be described as follows: (1) the regulation of all expiatory 
ceremonials needed as the result of pestilence, lightning, &c; 
(2) the consecration of all temples and other sacred places and 
objects dedicated to the gods by the state through its magis- 
trates; (3) the regulation of the calendar both astronomically 
and in detailed application to the public life of the state; (4) the 
administration of the law relating to burials and burying-places, 
and the worship of the Manes, or dead ancestors; (5) the superin- 
tendence of all marriages by confarreatio, i.e. originally of all 
legal patrician marriages; (6) the administration of the law of 
adoption and of testamentary succession. They had also the 
care of the state archives, of the lists of magistrates, and kept 
records of their own decisions (commentarii) and of the chief 
events of each year (annates). 

It is obvious that a priesthood having such functions as these, 
and holding office for life, must have been a great power in the 
state, and for the first three centuries of the republic it is probable 
that the pontifex maximus was in fact its most powerful member. 
The office might be combined with a magistracy, and, though 
its powers were declaratory rather than executive, it may fairly 
be described as quasi-magisterial. Under the later republic it 
was coveted chiefly for the great dignity of the position; Julius 
Caesar held it for the last twenty years of his life, and Augustus 
took it after the "death of Lepidus in 12 B.C., after which it 
became inseparable from the office of the reigning emperor. t 
With the decay of the empire the title very naturally fell to the 
popes, whose functions as administrators of religious law closely 
resembled those of the ancient Roman priesthood, hence the 
modern use of " pontiff " and " pontifical."

PONTIVY, a town of western France, chief town of an arron- 
dissement in the department of Morbihan, 46 m. N.N.W. of 
Vannes by rail. Pop. (1906), 6312 (town); 9506 (commune). 
The town, situated on the Blavet, at its confluence with tbe 
Nantes-Brest canal, comprises two distinct parts — the old town 
and that to the south known as Napoleonville. The latter, 
built by order of Napoleon I., who desired to make it the military 
headquarters for Brittany, and consisting chiefly of barracks, 
subsequently gave its name to the whole town, but in 1871 the 
old name was resumed. The ancient castle (1485) of the dukes

of Rohan, whose capital the town was, is occupied by the Musee 
le Brigant of art and archaeology. A' monument to commem- 
orate the Breton-Angevin Union, the deputies of which met at 
Pontivy in 1790, was erected in 1894, and there are statues of 
Dr Guepin, a democrat, and General de Lourmel (d. 1854). The 
town has a sub-prefecture, a tribunal of first instance, and a 
lycee for boys. Pontivy had its origin in a monastery founded 
in the 7th century by St Ivy, a monk of Lindisfarnc. 

PONT-L'ABBfi, a town of western France in the department 
of Finistere, 13 m. S.W. of Quimper by rail. Pop. (1906), of the 
town 4485, of the commune 6432. The town is situated on the 
right bank of the estuary or river of Pont-rAbbe, 2 m. from the 
sea. Its port carries on fishing, imports timber, coal, &c, and 
exports mine-props and the cereals and vegetables of the neigh- 
bourhood. Of the old buildings of the town the chief is a church 
of the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, once attached to a Carmelite 
convent; an old castle is occupied by the h6tel dc ville. The 
local costumes, trimmed with the bright-coloured embroideries 
for which the town is noted, are among the most striking in 
Brittany; the bigouden or head-dress of the women has given its 
name to the inhabitants. Pont-rAb,be carries on flour-milling 
and the extraction of chemicals from seaweed. 

PONTMARTIN, ARMAND AUGUSTIN JOSEPH MARIE 
FERRARD, Comte de (1811-1890), French critic and man of 
letters, was bom at Avignon (Vaucluse) on the 16th of July 181 1. 
Imbued by family tradition with legitimist sympathies, he began 
by attacking the followers of the encyclopaedists and their 
successors. In the AssembUenationale he published his Causeries 
lilUraires, a series of attacks on prominent Liberals, which created 
some sensation. Pontmartin was an indefatigable journalist, 
and most of his papers were eventually published in volume 
form: Conies el reveries d'un planteur de choux (184s); Causeries 
du samedi (1857-1860); Nouveaux samedis (1865-1881), &c. 
But the most famous of all his books is Les Jeiidis de Mme. 
Charbonneau (1862), which under the form of a novel offered 
a series of malicious and witty portraits of contemporary 
writers. Pontmartin died at Avignon on the 29th of March 
1890.

PONTOISE, a town of northern France, capital of an arron- 
dissement of the department of Seine-et-Oise, 18 m. N.W. of 
Paris on the railway to Dieppe. Pop. (1906), 7963. Pontoise 
is picturesquely situated on the right bank of the Oise where it 
is joined by the Viosne. The traffic on the main river is large, 
and the tributary drives numerous mills. Of the many churches 
that used to exist in the town two only remain: St Maclou, a 
church of the 12th century, altered and restored in the 15th and 
16th centuries by Pierre Lemercier, the famous architect of St 
Eustache at Paris, and containing a fine holy sepulchre of the 
16th century; and Notre-Dame, of the close of the 16th century, 
which contains the tomb of St Gautier, abbot of Meulan in the 
1 2th century. At the top of the flight of steps by which St 
Maclou is approached is the statue of General Leclerc, a native of 
the town and husband of Pauline Bonaparte. Grain and flour 
are the principal staples of the trade; a well-known fair is held 
in November. The town has a sub-prefecture, tribunals of first 
instance and of commerce and a communal college. At Mericl, 
near Pontoise, there are interesting remains of the Cistercian 
abbey of Le Val. Pontoise existed in the time of the Gauls as 
Briva Isarae (Bridge of the Oise). It was destroyed by the 
Normans in the 9th century, united with Normandy in 1032, and 
acquired by Philip I. in 1064. Capital of the French Vexin, it 
possessed an important stronghold and played a conspicuous 
part in the wars between the French and the dukes of Normandy 
and in the Hundred Years' War. The English took it in 1419, 
and again in 1437. In 1441 Charles VII. took it by storm after 
a three months' siege. After belonging to the count of Charolais 
down to the treaty of Conflans, it was given as a dowry to Jeanne 
of France when she was divorced by Louis XII. The parlement 
of Paris several times met in the town; and in 1561 the states- 
general convoked at Orleans removed thither after the death of 



Francis II. During the Fronde it offered a refuge to Louis XIV. 
and Mazarin. Henry III. made it an apanage for his brother 
the duke of Anjou. At a later period it passed to the duke of 
Conti. Down to the Revolution it remained a monastic town. 

PONTOON (Fr. ponton, from Lat. pons, a bridge), a flat- 
bottomed boat, used as a ferry boat or lighter; especially a boat 
of particular design intended to form part of a military bridge. 
In modern hydraulic engineering the words ponton and pontoon 
are used to designate hollow water-tight structures which are 
secured to sunken wrecks and bring them up to the surface, and 
also the hollow chambers which serve as gates for docks and 
sluices, and are lowered and raised by the admission and pumping 
out of water. 

Military Pontoon Bridges. — From time immemorial floating 
bridges of vessels bearing a roadway of beams and planks have 
been employed to facilitate the passage of rivers and arms of the 
sea. Xerxes crossed the Hellespont on a double bridge, one line 
supported on three hundred and sixty, the other on three hundred 
and fourteen vessels, anchored head and stern with their keels 
in the direction of the current. Darius threw similar bridges 
across the Bosporus and' the Danube in his war against the 
Scythians, and the Ten Thousand employed a bridge of boats 
to cross the river Tigris in their retreat from Persia. Floating 
bridges have been repeatedly constructed over rivers in Europe 
and Asia, not merely temporarily for the passage of an army, 
but permanently for the requirements of the country; and to this 
day many of the great rivers in India are crossed, on the lines of 
the principal roads, by floating bridges, which are for the most 
part supported on boats such as are employed for ordinary traffic 
on the river. 

But light vessels which can be taken out of the water and 
lifted on to carriages are required for transport with an army in 
the field. Alexander the Great occasionally carried with his 
army vessels divided into portions, which were put together 
on reaching the banks of a river, as in crossing the Hydaspes; he 
is even said to have carried his army over the Oxus by means 
of rafts made of the hide tents of the soldiers stuffed with straw, 
when he found that all the river boats had been burnt. Cyrus 
crossed the Euphrates on stuffed skins. The practice of carrying 
about skins to be inflated when troops had to cross a river, which 
was adopted by both Greeks and Romans, still exists in the 
East. In the 4th century the emperor Julian crossed the Tigris, 
Euphrates ^and other rivers by bridges of boats made of skins 
stretched over osier frames. In the wars of the 17th century 
pontoons are found as regular components of the trains of armies, 
the Germans using a leather, the Dutch a tin and the French a 
copper " skin " over stout timber frames. 

Modern military pontoons have been made of two forms, open 
as an undecked boat, or closed as a decked canoe or cylinder. 
During the Peninsular War the English employed open bateaux; 
but the experience gained in that war induced them to introduce 
the closed form. General Colleton devised a buoy pontoon, 
cylindrical with conical ends and made of wooden staves like a 
cask. Then General Sir Charles Pasley introduced demi-pon- 
toons, like decked canoes with pointed bows and square sterns, 
a pair, attached stern wise, forming a single " pier " of support 
for the roadway; they were constructed of light timber frames 
covered with sheet copper and were decked with wood; each 
demi-pontoon was divided internally into separate compartments 
by partitions which were made as water-tight as possible, and 
also supplied with the means of pumping out water; when trans- 
ported overland with an army a pair of demi-pontoons and the 
superstructure of one bay formed the load for a single carriage 
weighing 27-75 cwt - when loaded. The Pasley was superseded 
by the Blanshard pontoon, a tin coated cylinder with hemis- 
pherical ends, for which great mobility was claimed, two pon- 
toons and two bays superstructure being carried on one waggon, 
giving a weight of about 45 cwt., which was intended to be drawn 
by four horses. The Blanshard pontoon was long used in the 
British army, but was ultimately discarded; and British 
engineers came to the conclusion that it was desirable to return 
to the form of the open bateau to which the engineers of all the

PONTOON 



Continental armies had meanwhile constantly adhered. Captain 
Fowke, R.E., invented a folding open bateau, made of water- 
proof canvas attached to sliding ribs, so that for transport it 
could be collapsed like the bellows of an accordion and for use 
could be extended by a pair of stretchers. This was followed by 
the pontoon designed by Colonel Blood, R.E., an open bateau 
with decked ends and sides partly decked where the rowlock 
blocks were fixed. It consisted of six sets of framed ribs con- 
nected by a deep kelson, two side streaks, and three bottom 
streaks. The sides and bottom were of thin yellow pine with 
canvas secured to both surfaces by india-rubber solution, and 
coated outside with marine glue. The central interval between 
the pontoons in forming a bridge was invariably maintained at 
1 5 f t. ; for the support of the roadway five baulks were ordinarily 
employed, but nine for the passage of siege artillery and the 
heaviest loads; they fitted on to saddles resting on central 
saddle beams. The pontoons were not immersed to within i ft. 
of the tops of their " coamings " when carrying ordinary loads, 
as of infantry in marching order " in fours " crowded at a check, 
or the 16-pounder R.M.L. gun of position weighing 43 cwt.; nor 
were tbey immersed to within 6 in. when carrying extraordinary 
loads, such as disorganized infantry, or the 64-pounder R.M.L. 
gun weighing 98 cwt. In designing this pontoon the chief points 
attended to were — (1) improvement in power of support, (2) 
simplification in bridge construction, (3) reduction of weight in 
transport, and (4) adaptation for use singly as boats for ferrying 
purposes. One pontoon with the superstructure for a single 
bay constituted a load for one waggon, with a total weight 
behind horses of about 40 cwt. 

The^ following table (from Ency. Brit. 9th ed.) shows the powers 
of various pontoons in use by different nations in the past. Modern 
improvements are comparatively few. The " working power of 
support " has been calculated in most instances by deducting from 
the " available buoyancy " one-fourth for open and one-tenth for 
closed vessels : — 



In the English and French equipment the pontoons were originally 
made of two sizes, the smaller and lighter for the " advanced guard/ 1 
the larger and heavier for the '* reserve;" in both equipments 
the same size pontoon is now adopted for general requirements, the 
superstructure being strengthened when necessary for very heavy 
weights. The^ German army has an undivided galvanized iron pon- 
toon, 24 ft. 6 in. long, handy as a boat, but of inadequate buoyancy 
for heavy traffic, with the result that the span has to be diminished 
and ipso facto the waterway obstructed. The Austrian and Italian 
pontoons are made in three pieces, two with bows and a middle 
piece without ; not less than two pieces are ordinarily employed, and 
the third is introduced when great supporting power is required, 
but in all cases a constant interval is maintained between the 
pontoons. On the other hand, in the greater number of pontoon 
equipments greater supporting power is obtained not by increasing 
the number of supports but by diminishing the central interval 
between the pontoons. Within certain limits it does not matter 
whether the buoyancy is made up of a large number of small or a 
small number of large vessels, so long as the waterway is not unduly 
contracted and the obstruction offered to a swift current dangerously 
increased; but it is to be remembered that pontoon bridges have 
failed as frequently from being washed away as from insufficient 
buoyancy. In Austria efforts have been made to diminish the weight 
of the Birago equipment by the substitution of steel for iron. The 
present pontoon, in three pieces, is of steel, and 39 ft. 4 in. long, like 
the old pattern. 

In the British army Colonel Blood's equipment was later modified 
by the introduction of a bipartite pontoon designed in 1889 by 
Lieut. Clauson, R.E. Each pontoon is carried on one waggon with 
a bay of superstructure, and consists of two sections, a bow-piece and 
a stern-piece, connected together by easily manipulated couplings 
of phosphor bronze. Decks and " coamings " are dispensed with, 
and the rowlock holesare sunk in a strong gunwale. The detach- 
able saddle-beam, which receives the load on the centre of the 
thwarts, is made in sections, so as to form a continuous saddle of 
any length required. The baulks (or road-bearers) and chesses 
(or planks) remain unaltered, but chess-holders and chess-bearers 
are added for use in constructing light bridges for infantry in file. 
In this kind of bridge each pontoon section is used separately, 
with a roadway of chesses placed longitudinally four abreast. In 
the normal or medium bridge two sections, and in heavy bridge 
three sections are joined together. The chief advantages of the

equipment are (1) the buoyancy of the piers can be proportioned 
to the weight of traffic and to the roughness of the water; (2) 
owing to the special design of the bows, boats and rafts are easy to 
row, while the pontoons in bridge oppose little resistance to the 
current, and so require less anchor power; (3) transport rafts, pier- 
heads and flying bridges can be constructed with great ease, owing 
to the flush gunwales on which baulks can rest if necessary; (4) the 
pontoon sections are convenient to handle, easy to ship or to 
transport by rail, and can readily be replaced singly if damaged in 
bridge. A canoe pontoon and superstructure adapted for pack 
transport has also been adopted from designs by Colonel (Sir) Elliott 
Wood, C.B., R.E. The pontoon consists of four sections laced 
together, each section being a framework of wood covered with 
waterproof sheeting. Three pontoons and eight composite planks 
form a "unit/' from which can be constructed 48 ft. of bridge for 
infantry in file, 84 ft. for infantry in single file, or a raft to carry 15 
men or an empty wagon. 

For the British army in India the standard pontoon for many 
years was the Pasley; it was seldom used, however, for boats could 
almost always be procured on the spot in sufficient numbers where- 
ever a floating bridge had to be constructed. Later an equipment 
was prepared for the Indian army of demi-pontoons, similar to the 
Blood pontoon cut in half, and therefore more mobile; each has 
a bow and a square stern, and they are joined at the sterns when 
required to form a " pier "; they are fitted with movable covers and 
can therefore be used in much rougher water than pontoons of the 
home pattern, and their power of support and breadth of roadway 
are the same. The Chitral Relief Expedition of 1895, however, 
revealed certain defects. The shape of the bow was unsuited to 
rapid currents; the balance was not satisfactory, and the copper 
sheathing cracked. Experiments were then undertaken with the 
bipartite pontoon. 

The india-rubber pontoon does not appear to have been generally 
employed even in America, where it was invented. The engineer 
officers with the army of the Potomac, after full experience of the 
india-rubber pontoon and countless other inventions of American 
genius, adopted the French equipment, which they found " most 
excellent, useful and reliable for all military purposes.' ' The 
Russians, in crossing the Danube in their war with Turkey in 1878, 
employed the Austrian equipment. Aluminium pontoons have 
been tried in Germany, but have not been adopted. 

For light bridging work the Berthon and other collapsible boats 
have been adopted in Germany and Great Britain, especially for 
cavalry work in advance of the army. The German folding boat is 
made of wood framework and canvas skin; two boats are easily 
carried on one " folding-boat wagon." The total length of the three 
sections together is 21 ft. 6 in. The British field troop R.E., 
attached to cavalry, carries two collapsible boats 18 ft. 6 in. iong. 
^ The methods of constructing pontoon bridges have been simpli- 
fied of late years in most armies, and are usually restricted to (1) 
adding pontoons one by one to the head of the bridge; (2) con- 
necting rafts of two or more pontoons into bridge by intermediate 
bays of superstructure; and (3) swinging across the river a bridge 
previously prepared alongside the shore. The formation of a bridge 
from rafts touching one another consumes an excessive amount 
of equipment, and opposes unnecessary resistance to the stream ; it 
is therefore being discarded in most armies. " Booming out " 
the bridge bay by bay from the shore until the head reaches the 
opposite bank is unsuited for rapid currents, and is almost obsolete 
except for light infantry bridges. 

In every army the pontoon service is in the hands of technical 
specialists. 1 But there are many other forms of military 
bridging, in which the specialist only supervises the work of the 
ordinary soldier, or indeed, takes no part. whatever. Troops of 
all arms are expected to be familiar with certain methods of 
rough temporary bridging. In the British service the forms 
of temporary timber bridge usually employed are called trestle, 
lock and floating. The trestle bridge in its various forms con- 
sists of a series of two-legged or three-legged trestles carrying the 
road-bearers and chesses which form the roadway. Trestles 
can J3e improvised, but some are carried, ready for use, by 
mobile engineer units and they are frequently combined with 
pontoon bridges at the shore ends, where holding ground for 
the feet of the trestles is found. Lock bridges never touch 
water, forming single spans over a chasm. These consist of 
spars made into frames of which the feet rest in the banks of the 
river and the heads are interlocked, the whole being securely 
lashed. Another type of frame-bridge is the cantilever, which 
has been used in Indian frontier expeditions to bridge swift 

1 In Germany, however, as mentioned below, light brideine 
material has been placed in the hands of the cavalry. This tendency 
in accordance with the needs of modern armies, will probably 
become more pronounced in the future. It began with the pro- 
vision of demolition equipment for the cavalry pioneers. 



steep-banked streams. Improvised suspension bridges are also 
used. Floating bridges are made not only of pontoons but also 
of boats of all sorts, casks lashed together, and rafts. They are 
almost always combined with one or two bays of trestle bridging 
at the shore ends. 

The organization of bridging personnel in different armies shows 
as much divergence^ opinion as the design of pontoon equipment. 
In Great Britain, since the divisional reorganization, the bridging 
trains have been assigned to the "army troops," which include 
two " bridging trains, ' totalling 14 officers and 454 men with 92 
vehicles, most of them six-horsed. Each train carries 32 pontoons 
and 32 bays of superstructure, as well as 16 trestles and 8 bays of 
the appropriate^ superstructure, and can construct 200 yds. of 
medium bridge in all. Besides these trains the divisional engineer 
units (2 field companies per division) bear with them in all 4 pontoons 
and 4 trestles, with the necessary bays of superstructure, their 
total bridging capacity being about ao yds. of medium bridge. 
In France each army corps has a bridging train which admits of 
the construction of bridges to the extent ©f about 120 yds. of 




which can furnish 280 yds. of medium bridging apiece. These 
would be allotted in accordance with the requirements of particular 
campaigns. In Germany the increasing importance attached to 
independent cavalry operations has led to the assignment of a 
folding-boat wagon to every cavalry regiment. The regimental 
equipment provides for a ferry, capable of taking 25 to 30 infantrymen, 
one artillery vehicle or four horses at one journey, a foot-bridge 
22 to 35 yds. in length, or a light bridge of 8 to 13 yds. By 
assembling the material of a whole cavalry division of 6 regiments, 
a foot-bridge of 110 to 210 yds. or a light bridge of 57 to 70 yds. 
can be constructed. The corps bridging train of a German army 
corps can construct 140 yds. of medium or 170 yds. of light 
bridging, and each of the two divisional trains, 40 yds. of medium 
and 48 yds. of light bridging. 

PONTOPPIDAN, ERIK (169S-1764), Danish author, was 
born at Aarhus on the 24th of August 1698. He studied 
divinity at the university of Copenhagen, and for some time 
acted as a travelling tutor. In 1735 he became one of the 
chaplains of the king. In 1738 he was made professor extra- 
ordinary of theology at Copenhagen, and in 1745 bishop of 
Bergen, Norway, where he died on the 20th of December 1764. 

His principal works are: Theatrum Daniae veteris et modernac 
(£to, 1730), a description of the geography, natural history, an- 
tiquities, &c, of Denmark; Gesta et vestigia danorum extra Daniam 
(3 vols. 8vo, 17^0), a laborious but uncritical work; Annates 
ecclesiae danicae (3 vols., 1741-1747); Marmora danica selectiora 
(2 vols, fol., 1 739-1 741); Glossarium norvegicum (1749); Det fdrste 
forsog Norses naturhgc historic (4to, 1752-1754); Eng. trans., 
Natural History of Norway (2 vols., 1755), containing curious 
accounts, often referred to, of the Kraaken, sea-serpent, and the 
like; Origines hafnienses (1760); Menoza (3 vols., 1742-1743), a 
religious novel. His Danske Atlas (7 vols. 4to), an historical and 
topographical account of Denmark, was mostly posthumous.

(vol. xiii., 1899). 

PONTOPPIDAN, HENRIK (1857- ), Danish author, son 
of a pastor, was born at Fredericia on the 24th of July 1857. 
He studied physics and mathematics at the university of Copen- 
hagen, and when he was eighteen he travelled on foot through 
Germany and Switzerland. His novels show an intimate 
acquaintance with peasant life and character, the earlier ones 
showing clear evidence of the influence of Kjelland. An 
excellent example of his work is in the trilogy dealing with the 
history of Emanuel Hansted, a theorizing radical parson who 
marries a peasant wife. These three stories, Muld (" Soil," 
1891), Det Forjaettede Land (" The Promised Land," 1892), and 
Dommcns Dag (1895) are marked by fine discrimination and 
great narrative power. Among his other works are Fra Hytterne 
(1887), Folkelivsskildringcr (2 parts,' 1888-1890), and Skyer (1800). 
He began in 1898 a new series in Lykkc Per, the story of a typical 
Jutlander.

xiii., 1899). 

PONTORMO, JACOPO DA (1494-1557), whose family name 
was Carucci, Italian painter of the Florentine school, was born 
at Pantormo in 1494, son of a painter of ordinary ability, was 
apprenticed to Leonardo da Vinci, and afterwards took lessons 
from Piero di Cosimo. At the age of eighteen he became a 



PONTREMOLI— PONTUS 



journeyman to Andrea del Sarto, and was remarked as a young 
man of exceptional accomplishment and promise. Later on, 
but still in early youth, he executed, in continuation of Andrea's 
labours, the " Visitation," in the cloister of the Servi in Florence 
— one of the principal surviving evidences of his powers. The 
most extensive series of works which he ever undertook was a 
set of frescoes in the church of S. Lorenzo, Florence, from the 
" Creation of Man to the Deluge," closing with the " Last 
Judgment." By this time, towards 1546, he had fallen under 
the dangerous spell of Michelangelo's colossal genius and super- 
human style; and Pontormo, after working on at the frescoes 
for eleven years, left them incomplete, and the object of general 
disappointment and disparagement. They were finished by 
Angelo Bronzino, but have long since vanished under whitewash. 
Among the best works of Pontormo are his portraits, which 
include the likenesses of various members of the Medici family; 
they are vigorous, animated and highly finished. He was fond 
of new and odd experiments both in style of art and in method of 
painting. From Da Vinci he caught one of the marked physio- 
gnomic traits of his visages, smiles and dimples. At one time 
he took to direct imitation or reproduction of Albert Diirer, 
and executed a series of paintings founded on the Passion 
subjects of the German master, not only in composition, but 
even in such peculiarities as the treatment of draperies, &c. 
Pontormo died of dropsy on the 2nd of January 1557, mortified 
at the ill success of his frescoes in S. Lorenzo; he was buried 
below his work in the Servi. 

'PONTREMOLI, a town and bishop's see of the province of 
Massa and Carrara, Tuscany, Italy, in the upper valley of the 
Magra, 25 m. N. by E. of Spezia by rail and 49 m. S.S.W. of 
Parma, 843 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901), 4107 (town); 
*4>57° (commune). It has a 17th-century cathedral. The 
church of the Annunziata with its Augustinian monastery is 
interesting. There are also mineral springs. The town, which 
is well situated among the mountains, was an independent 
republic in the 12th and 13th centuries, and in 1495 was sacked 
by the troops of Charles VIII. of France. It was much damaged 
by an earthquake in 1834. 

PONTUS, a name applied in ancient times to extensive tracts 
of country in the north-east of Asia Minor bordering on the 
Euxine (Black Sea), which was often called simply Pontos 
(the Main), by the Greeks. The exact signification of this 
purely territorial name varied greatly at different times. The 
Greeks used it loosely of various parts of the shores of the Euxine, 
and the term did not get a definite connotation till after the 
establishment of the kingdom founded beyond the Halys during 
the troubled period following the death of Alexander the Great, 
about 301 B.C., by Mithradates I., Ktistes, son of a Persian 
satrap in the service of Antigonus, one of Alexander's successors, 
and ruled by a succession of kings, mostly bearing the same name, 
till 64 B.C. As the greater part of this kingdom lay within 
the immense region of Cappadocia, which in early ages extended 
from the borders of Cilicia to the Euxine, the kingdom as a 
whole was at first called " Cappadocia towards the Pontus " 
(irpbs rco ILWco), but afterwards simply " Pontus," the name 
Cappadocia being henceforth restricted to the southern half 
of the region previously included under that title. Under the 
last king, Mithradates Eupator, commonly called the Great, 
the realm of Pontus included not only Pontic Cappadocia but 
also the seaboard from the Bithynian frontier to Colchis, part 
of inland Paphlagonia, and Lesser Armenia (see under Mithra- 
dates). With the destruction of this kingdom by Pompey 
in 64 B.C., the meaning of the name Pontus underwent a change. 
Part of the kingdom was now annexed to the Roman Empire, 
being united with Bithynia in a double province called " Pontus 
and Bithynia": this part included (possibly from the first, 
but certainly from about 40 B.C. onwards) only the seaboard 
between Heracleia (Eregli) and Amisus (Samsun), the ora Pontica. 
Hereafter the simple name Pontus without qualification was 
regularly employed to denote the half of this dual province, 
especially by Romans and people speaking from the Roman 
point of view; it is so used almost always in the New Testament. 



But it was also frequently used to denote (in whole or part) that 
portion of the old Mithradatic kingdom which lay between the 
Halys (roughly) and the borders of Colchis, Lesser Armenia, 
Cappadocia and Galatia — the region properly designated by 
the title " Cappadocia towards the Pontus," which was always 
the nucleus of the Pontic kingdom. 

This region is regarded by the geographer Strabo (a.d. 10-20), 
himself a native of the country, as Pontus in the strict sense 
of the term (Geogr. p. 678). Its native population was of the 
same stock as that of Cappadocia, of which it had formed a part, 
an Oriental race often called by the Greeks Leucosyri or White 
Syrians, as distinguished from the southern Syrians, who were 
of a darker complexion, but their precise ethnological relations 
are uncertain. Geographically it is a table-land, forming the 
north-east corner of the great plateau of Asia Minor, edged on the 
north by a lofty mountain rim, along the foot of which runs a 
fringe of coast-land. The table-land consists of a series of fertile 
plains, of varying size and elevation separated from each other 
by upland tracts or mountains, and it is drained almost entirely 
by the river Iris (Yeshil Irmak) and its numerous tributaries, 
the largest of which are the Scylax ( Tchekerek Irmak) with many 
affluents and the Lycus (Kalkid Irmak), all three rising in the 
highlands near, or on, the frontier of Armenia Minor and flowing 
first in a westerly and then in a north-westerly direction to 
merge their waters in a joint stream, which (under the name 
of the Iris) pierces the mountain-wall and emerges on the east . 
of Amisus (Samsun). Between the Halys and the Iris the 
mountain rim is comparatively low and broken, but east of the 
Iris it is a continuous lofty ridge (called by the ancients Pary- 
adres and Scydises), whose rugged northern slopes are furrowed 
by torrent beds, down which a host of small streams (among 
them the Thcrmodon, famed in Amazon story) tumble to the 
sea. These inaccessible slopes were inhabited even in Strabo's 
time by wild, half-barbarous tribes, of whose ethnical relations 
we are ignorant — the Chalybes (identified by the Greeks with 
Homer's Chalybes), Tibareni, Mosynoeci and Macrones, on 
whose manners and condition some light is thrown by Xenophon 
(Anab. V). But the fringe of coast-land from Trebizond 
westward is one of the most beautiful parts of Asia Minor and 
is justly extolled by Strabo for its wonderful productiveness. 

The sea-coast, like the rest of the south shore of the Euxine, 
was studded with Greek colonies founded from the 6th century 
onwards: Amisus, a colony of Miletus, which in the 5th century 
received a body of Athenian settlers, now the port of Samsun; 
Cotyora, now Ordu; Cerasus, the later Pharnacia, now Kerasund; 
and Trapczus (Trebizond), a famous city from Xenophon's 
time till the end of the middle ages. The last three were 
colonies of Sinope, itself a Milesian colony. The chief towns 
in the interior were Amasia, on the Iris, the birthplace of Strabo, 
the capital of Mithradates the Great, and the burial-place of the 
earlier kings, whose tombs still exist; Comana, higher up the 
river, a famous centre of the worship of the goddess Ma (or 
Cybele); Zcla, another great religious centre, refounded by 
Pompey, now Zileh; Eupatoria, refounded by Pompey as 
Magnopolis at the junction of the Lycus and Iris; Cabira, 
Pompey 's Diospolis, afterwards Neocaesarea, now Niksar; 
Sebastopolis on the Scylax, now Sulu Serat; Sebasteia, now 
Sivas; and Megalopolis, a foundation of Pompey, somewhere in 
the same district. 

The history of this region is the history of the advance of 
the Roman Empire towards the Euphrates. Its political 
position between 64 and 41 B.C., when Mark Antony became 
master of the East, is not quite certain. Part of it was handed 
over by Pompey to client princes: the coast-land east of the 
Halys (except the territory of Amisus) and the hill-tribes of 
Paryadres were given, with Lesser Armenia, to the Galatian 
chief Deiotarus, with the title of king; Comana was left under 
the rule of its high-priest. The rest of the interior was parti- 
tioned by Pompey amongst the inland cities, almost all of which 
were founded by him, and, according to one view, was included 
together with the seaboard west of Amisus and the corner of north- 
east Paphlagonia possessed by Mithradates in his new province

Pontus-Bithynia. Others maintain that only the seaboard 
was included in the province, the inland cities being constituted 
self-governing, " protected " communities. The latter view 
is more in conformity with Roman policy in the East, which 
did not usually annex countries till they reached (under the 
rule of client princes) a certain level of civilization and order, 
but it is difficult to reconcile with Strabo's statements (p. 541 
sqq.). In any case, during the years following 40 B.C. all inland 
Pontus was handed over, like north-east Paphlagonia, to native 
dynasts. The Pontic possessions of Dciotarus (d. 40 B.C.) were 
given with additions (e.g. Cabira) in 39 B.C. to Darius, son of 
Pharnaces, and in $6 B.C. to Polemon, son of a rhetorician of 
Laodicea on the Lycus. The high-priest of Comana, Lycomedes, 
received an accession of territory and the royal title. The 
territories of Zela and Megalopolis were divided between Lyco- 
medes, the high-priest of Zela and Ateporix, who ruled the 
principality of Carana (later Sebastopolis). Amasia and 
Amisus were also given to native princes. 

After the battle of Actium (31 B.C.) Augustus restored 
Amisus as a " free city " to the province of Bithynia-Pontus, 
but made no other serious change. Polemon retained his king- 
dom till his death in 8 B.C., when it passed to his widow Pytho- 
doris. But presently the process of annexation began and the 
Pontic districts were gradually incorporated in the empire, 
each being attached to the province of Galatia, then the centre 
of Roman forward policy. (1) The western district was an- 
nexed in two sections, Sebastopolis and Amasia in 3-2 B.C., 
and Comana in a.d. 34-35. To distinguish this district from 
the province Pontus and Polemon's Pontus, it was henceforth 
called Pontus galaticus (as being the first part attached to 
Galatia). (2) Polemon's kingdom, ruled since a.d. 38 by Pole- 
mon II., grandson of the former king, was annexed by Nero in 
a.d. 64-65, and distinguished by the title of Port Ins polemoniacus, 
which survived for centuries. [But the simple name Pontus, 
hitherto commonly used to designate Polemon's realm, is still 
employed to denote this district by itself or in conjunction 
with Pontus Galaticus, where the context makes the meaning 
clear (e.g. in inscriptions and on coins).] Polemoniacus 
included the sea-coast from the Thermodon to Cotyora and the 
inland cities Zela, Magnopolis, Megalopolis, Neocaesarea and 
Scbasteia (according to Ptolemy, but apparently annexed since 
2 B.C., according to its coins). (3) Finally, at the same time 
(a.d. 64) was annexed the remaining eastern part of Pontus, 
which formed part of Polemon's realm but was attached to 
the province Cappadocia and distinguished by the epithet 
cappadocicus. These three districts formed distinct adminis- 
trative divisions within the provinces to which they were 
attached, with separate capitals Amasia, - Neocaesarea and 
Trapezus; but the first two were afterwards merged in one, 
sometimes called Pontus mediterraneus, with ' Neocaesarea as 
capital, probably when they were definitively transferred 
(about a.d. 114) to Cappadocia, then the great frontier military 
province. 

With the reorganization of the provincial system under 
Diocletian (about a.d. 295), the Pontic districts were divided 
up between four provinces of the dloecesis pontica: (1) Paphla- 
gonia, to which was attached most of the old province Pontus; 
(2) Diospontus, re-named Helenopontus by Constantine, con- 
taining the rest of the province Pontus and the adjoining dis- 
trict, eight cities in all (including Sinopc, Amisus and Zela) with 
Amasia as capital; (3) Pontus Polemoniacus, containing Comana, 
Polemonium, Cerasus and Trapezus with Neocaesarea as 
capital; and (4) Armenia Minor, five cities, with Sebasteia, as 
capital. This rearrangement gave place in turn to the Byzantine 
system of military districts (themes). 

Christianity was introduced into the province Pontus (the 
Or a pontica) by way of the sea in the 1st century after Christ 
and was deeply rooted when Pliny governed the province 
(a.d. 111-113). But the Christianization of the inland Pontic 
districts began only about the middle of the 3rd century and 
was largely due to the missionary zeal of Gregory Thaumaturgus, 
bishop of Neocaesarea.

PONTUS DE TYARD (c. 1521-1605), French poet and member 
of the Pleiade (see Daurat), was seigneur of Bissy in Burgundy, 
where he was born in or about 1521. He was a friend of Antoine 
Heroet and Maurice Scevc, and to a certain extent anticipated 
Ronsard and Joachim Du Bellay. His Erreurs amoureuses, 
originally pubb'shed in 1549, was augmented with other poems 
in successive editions till 1573. On the whole his poetry is 
inferior to that of his companions, but he was one of the first 
to write sonnets in French (the actual priority belongs to Melin 
dc St Gelais). It is also said that he introduced the sestine 
into France, or rather reintroduced it, for it was originally 
a Provencal invention. In his later years he gave himself up 
to the study of mathematics and philosophy. He became bishop 
of Chalons-sur-Sa6ne in 1578, and in 1587 appeared his Discours 
philosophiques. He was a zealous defender of the cause of 
Henry III. against the pretensions of the Guises. This attitude 
brought down on him the vengeance of the league; he was 
driven from Chalons and his chateau at Bissy was plundered. 
He survived all the members of the Pleiade and lived to sec the 
onslaught made on their doctrines by Malherbe. Pontus 
resigned his bishopric in 1594, and retired to the chateau de 
Bragny, where he died on the 23rd of September 1605. 

His Oeuvres poUiques may be found in the PISiade francaise (1875) 
of M. Ch. Marty-Laveaux. 

PONTYPOOL, a market town in the northern parliamentary 
division of Monmouthshire, England, 8 m. N. of Newport, 
served by the Great Western, London & North- West em, and 
Rhymney railways. Pop. of urban district (1901), 6126. It 
is beautifully situated on an acclivity above the Afon Lwyd, 
a tributary of the Usk. Its prosperity is due to its situation 
on the edge of the great coal- and iron-field of Monmouthshire 
and Glamorganshire. The earliest record of trade in iron is in 
1588, but it was developed chiefly in the beginning of the 18th 
century by the family of Hanbury, the proprietors of Pontypool 
Park. Pontypool was formerly famed for its japanned goods, 
invented by Thomas Allwood, a native of Northampton, who 
settled in the town in the reign of Charles II., but the manu- 
facture has long been transferred elsewhere. The town and 
neighbourhood contain large forges and iron mills for the manu- 
facture of iron-work and tin-plate. Water communication 
is afforded with Newport by the Monmouthshire Canal. On 
the south-east of Pontypool is the urban district of Panteg, 
including Griffithstown, with a population (1901) of 7484. 

PONTYPRIDD, a parish, market town, and urban district, 
in the eastern parliamentary division of Glamorganshire, Wales, 
situated on the Taff at its junction with the Rhondda, on the 
Taff Vale railway, and on the Glamorganshire Canal, 12 m. 
N.N.W. from Cardiff, 12 S. from Merthyr-Tydfil, and 169 by rail 
from London. It is also connected with Newport by a Great 
Western line 18} m. long. Pop. (1901), 32,316. It receives its 
name from a remarkable bridge of one arch spanning the Taff, 
erected in 1755 by William Edwards, a self-taugbt mason. 
The bridge is a perfect segment of a circle, the chord being 
140 ft., and the height at low water 36 ft. A three-arched bridge 
was erected close to it in 1857. The town is built at the junc- 
tion of the three parishes of Llanwonno, Llantwit Fardre and 
Eglwysilan, out of portions of which Glyntaff was formed into 
an ecclesiastical parish in 1848, and from this Pontypridd was 
carved in 1884. The urban district was constituted into a 
civil parish in 1894. The church of St Catherine, built in 
1868, enlarged in 1885, is in early Decorated style; other places 
of worship are the Baptist, Calvinistic Methodist, Congrega- 
tional, and Weslcyan chapels. The principal secular buildings 
are a masonic hall, town-hall built above the market, free library 
(1890), county intermediate school (1895) and court-house. 
Near the town is a far-famed rocking-stone 9 \ tons in weight, 
known as the Maen Chwyf, round which a circle of small stones 
was set up in the middle of the 19th century under the direction

PONY— POOLE, R. S. 



of Myvyr Morganwg, who used to style himself archdruid of 
Wales. The place became, for a time, famous as a meeting 
place for neo-Druidic gatherings. Pontypridd was an insig- 
nificant village till the opening of the Taff Vale railway into 
the town in 1840, and it owed its progress chiefly to the de- 
velopment of the coal areas of the Rhondda Valley, for which 
district it serves as the market town and chief business centre. 
It also possesses anchor, chain, and cable works, chemical works, 
and iron and brass foundries. Pontypridd has, jointly with 
Rhondda, a stipendiary magistrate since 1872. 

PONY (from the Lowland Scots powney, probably from O. Fr. 
poulerietj diminutive of poidain, a colt or foal; Late Lat. pullanus, 
Lat. pulluSy a young animal), a horse of a small breed, sometimes 
confined to such as do not exceed 13 hands in height, but 
generally applied to any horse under 14 hands (see Horse). The 
word is of frequent use as a slang term — e.g. for a sum of £25; 
for a liquor measure or glass containing less than a half-pint; 
and in America for a literal translation of a foreign or classical 
author, a " crib." 

PONZA (anc. Pontiae), the principal of a small group of 
islands belonging to Italy. Pop. (1901), 4621. The group is of 
volcanic origin, and includes Palmarola (anc. Palmaria), Zannone 
(Sinonia), Ventotene (Pandateria, pop. in 1901, 1986) and San 
Stefano. It is situated about 20 m. S. of Monte Circeo and 
70 m. W. of Naples, and belongs partly to the province of Caserta 
and partly to that of Naples (Ventotene). There is regular 
communication with Naples by steamer, and in summer with 
Anzio. The islands rise to a height of about 70 ft. above sea- 
level. They are now penal settlements, and their isolated 
character led to their being similarly used in ancient times. A 
colony with Latin rights was founded on Pontiae in 313 B.C. 
Nero, Germanicus's eldest son, and the sisters of Caligula, were 
confined upon it; while Pandateria was the place of banishment 
of Julia, daughter of Augustus, of her daughter Agrippina the 
elder, and of Octavia, the divorced wife of Nero. 

POOD, a Russian weight, equivalent to 40 ib Russian and 
about $6 lb avoirdupois. A little more than 62 poods go to 
the ton. The word is an adaptation of the Low German or 
Norse pund } pound. 

POOL. (1) A pond, or a small body of still water; also a 
place in a river or stream where the water is deep and still, so 
applied in the Thames to that part of the river known as The 
Pool, which reaches from below London Bridge to Limehouse. 
The word in Old English was pdl, which may be related to pull 
or pylly and the similar Celtic words, e.g. Cornish pol t a creek, 
common on the Bristol Channel and estuary of the Severn, on 
the English side in the form " pill." A further connexion has 
been suggested with Lat. palus, marsh; Gr. 7n?\6s, mud. (2) 
A name for the stakes, penalties, &c, in various card and other 
games when collected together to be paid out to the winners; 
also the name of a variety of games of billiards (q.v.). This 
word has a curious history. It is certainly adapted from Fr. 
poule, hen, chicken, apparently a slang term for the stakes in 
a game, possibly, as the New English Dictionary suggests, used 
as a synonym for plunder, booty. " Chicken-hazard " might 
be cited as a parallel, though that has been taken to be a cor- 
ruption of " chequeen," a form of the Turkish coin, a sequin. 
When the word came into use in English at the end of the 17 th 
century, it seems to have been at once identified with " pool," 
pond, as Fr. fiche (ficher, to fix), a counter, was with "fish," 
counters in card games often taking the form of " fish " made 
of mother-of-pearl, &c. " Pool," in the sense of a common 
fund, has been adopted as a commercial term for a combination 
for the purpose of speculating in stocks and shares, the several 
owners of securities " pooling" them and placing them under a 
single control, and sharing all losses and profits. Similarly 
the name is given to a form of trade combination, especially in 
railway or shipping companies, by which the receipts or profits 
are divided on a certain agreed-upon basis, for the purpose of 
avoiding competition (see Trusts). 

POOLE, MATTHEW (1624-1679), English Nonconformist 
theologian, was born at York, educated at Emmanuel College, 



Cambridge, and from 1649 till the passing of the Act of Unifor- 
mity (1662) held the rectory of St Michael le Querne, London. 
Subsequent troubles led to his withdrawal to Holla'nd, and he 
died at Amsterdam in 1679. The work with which his name 
is principally associated is the Synopsis criticorum biblicorum 
(5 vols, fol., 1 669-1 676), in which he summarizes the views of one 
hundred and fifty biblical critics. He also wrote English Anno- 
tations on the Holy Bible, as far as Isa. lviii. — a work which 
was completed by several of his Nonconformist brethren, and 
published in 2 vols. fol. in 1683. 

POOLE, PAUL FALCONER (1806-1879), English painter, 
was born at Bristol in 1806. Though self-taught his fine feeling 
for colour, poetic sympathy and dramatic power gained for him 
a high position among British artists. He exhibited his first 
work in the Royal Academy at the age of twenty-five, the sub- 
ject being " The Well," a scene in Naples. There was an interval 
of seven years before he next exhibited his " Farewell, Farewell " 
in 1837, which was followed by the " Emigrant's Departure," 
" Hermann and Dorothea " and " By the Waters of Babylon." 
In 1843 his position was made secure by his " Solomon Eagle," 
and by his success in the, Cartoon Exhibition, in which he received 
from the Fine Art Commissioners a prize of £300 sterling. After 
his exhibition of the " Surrender of Syon House " he was elected 
an associate of the Royal Academy in 1846, and was made an 
academician in 1861. He died in 1879. 

Poole's subjects divide themselves into two orders — one 
idyllic, the other dramatic. Of the former his " May Day " 
(1852) is a typical example. Of both styles there were excellent 
examples to be seen in the small collection of his works shown 
at Burlington House in the Winter Exhibition of 1 883-1 884. 
Among his early dramatic pictures was " Solomon Eagle ex- 
horting the People to Repentance during the Plague of 1665," 
painted in 1843. To this class belongs also the " Messenger 
announcing to Job the Irruption of the Sabeans and the 
Slaughter of the Servants " (exhibited in 1850), and " Robert, 
Duke of Normandy and Arietta " (1848). Finer examples of 
his more mature power in this direction are to be found in his 
" Prodigal Son," painted in 1869; the " Escape of Glaucus and 
lone with the blind girl Nydia from Pompeii" (i860); and 
" Cunstaunce sent adrift by the Constable of Alia, King of 
Northumberland," painted in 1868. More peaceful than these 
are the " Song of Troubadours " (painted in 1854) and the " Goths 
in Italy " (1851), the latter an important historical work of 
great power and beauty. Of a less lofty strain, but still more 
beautiful in its workmanship, is the " Seventh Day of the 
Decameron," painted in 1857. In this picture Poole rises to his 
full height as a colourist. In his pastorals he is soft and tender, 
as in the " Mountain Path " (1853), the " Water-cress Gatherers " 
(1870), the " Shepston Maiden " (1872). But when he turns to 
the grander and 'more sublime views of nature his work is bold 
and vigorous. Fine examples of this style may be seen in the 
" Vision of Ezekiel " of the National Gallery, " Solitude " 
(1876), the "Entrance to the Cave of Mammon" (1875), the 
" Dragon's Cavern" (1877), and perhaps best of all in the "Lion 
in the Path " (1873), a great representation of mountain and 
cloud form. 

POOLE, REGINALD STUART (1832-1895), English archae- 
ologist and orientalist, was born in London on the 27th of 
January 1832. His father was the Rev. Edward Poole, a well- 
known bibliophile. His mother, Sopha, authoress of The 
Englishwoman in Egypt (1844), was the sister of E. W. Lane, 
the Arabic scholar, with whom R. S. Poole lived in Cairo from 
1842 to 1849, thus imbibing an early taste for Egyptian 
antiquities. In 1852 he became an assistant in the British 
Museum, and was assigned to the department of coins and 
medals, of which in 1870 he became keeper. In that capacity 
he did work of the highest value, alike as a writer, teacher and 
administrator. In 1882 he was largely responsible for founding 
the Egypt Exploration Fund, and in 1884 for starting the Society 
of English Medallists. He retired in 1893, and died on the 8th 
of February 1895. Some of Poole's best work was done in his 
articles for the Emy. Brit. (9th ed.) on Egypt, Hieroglyphics

and Numismatics, and considerable portions have been retained 
in the present -edition, even though later research has been 
active in his sphere of work; he also wrote for Smith's Dictionary 
of the Bible, and published several volumes dealing with his 
special subjects. He was for some time professor of archae- 
ology at University College, London, and also lecturer at the 
Royal Academy. 

His elder brother, Edward Stanley Poole (1830-1867), 
who was chief clerk in the science and art department at South 
Kensington, was an Arabic scholar, whose early death cut short 
a promising career. His two sons, Stanley Lane-Poole (b. 1854), 
professor of Arabic in Trinity College, Dublin, and Reginald 
Lane-Poole (b. 1857), keeper of the archives at Oxford, 
lecturer in diplomatic, and author of various historical works, 
carried on the family tradition of scholarship. 

POOLE, a municipal borough, county in itself, market town 
and seaport in the eastern parliamentary division of Dor- 
setshire, England, 113J m. S.W. by W. from London by the 
London & South-Western railway. Pop. (1901), 19,463. It 
is picturesquely situated on a peninsula between Holes Bay 
and the shallow irregular inlet of Poole* Harbour. There arc 
several modern churches, a guildhall, public library and school 
of art. Poole Harbour, extending inland 6 m., with a general 
breadth of 4 m., has a very narrow entrance, and is studded 
with low islands, on the largest of which, Brownsea or Branksea, 
is a castle, transformed into a residence, erected as a defence 
of the harbour in Tudor times, and strengthened by Charles I. 
Potters* clay is worked here. At low water the harbour is 
entirely emptied except a narrow channel, when there is a 
depth of 8| ft. There are some valuable oyster beds. There 
is a considerable general coasting trade, and clay is exported 
to the Staffordshire potteries. Some shipbuilding is carried 
on, and there are manufacturers of cordage, netting and sail- 
cloth. The town also possesses potteries, decorative tile works, 
iron foundries, agricultural implement works and flour-mills. 
Poole Park, containing 40 acres of land and 62 acres of water, 
was acquired in 1887 and 1889, and Branksome Park, of 
40 acres, in 1895. The borough is under a mayor, 6 aldermen 
and 18 councillors. Area, 5333 acres. 

Although the neighbourhood abounds • in British earth- 
works and barrows, and there are traces of a Roman road lead- 
ing from Poole to Wimborne, Poole (La Pole) is not mentioned 
by the early chroniclers or in Domesday Book. The manor, 
part of that of Canford, belonged in 1086 to Edward of Salis- 
bury, and passed by marriage to William Longespe'e, earl of 
Salisbury, thence to Edmund de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, and with 
his heiress to Thomas, earl of Lancaster, and so to the Crown. 
Poole is first mentioned in a writ of 1224, addressed to the bailiffs 
and good men of La Pole, ordering them to retain all ships within 
their port. Entries in the Patent Rolls show that Poole had 
considerable trade before William de LongespSe, earl of Sabs- 
bury, granted the burgesses a charter about 1 248 assuring to 
them all liberties and free customs within his borough. The 
bailiff was to be chosen by the lord from six men elected by 
the burgesses, and was to hold pleas for breach of measures 
and assizes. It is uncertain when the burgesses obtained their 
town at the fee-farm rent of £8, 13s. 4d. mentioned in 131 2. 
The mayor, bailiffs and good men are first mentioned in 131 1 
and were required to provide two ships for service against 
Robert de Brus. In 1372 the burgesses obtained assize of 
bread and ale, and right to hold the courts of the lord of the 
manor, the prepositus being styled his mayor. The burgesses 
were licensed in 1433 to fortify the town; this was renewed in 
1462, when the mayor was given cognisance of the staple. 
Elizabeth incorporated Poole in 1569 and made it a separate 
county; Charles II. gave a charter in 1667. The corporation 
was suspended after a writ of quo warranto in 1686, the town 
being governed by the commission of the peace until the 
charters were renewed in 1688. Poole returned two members to 
parliament in 1362 and 1368, and regularly from 1452 to 1867, 
when the representation was reduced, ceasing in 1885. It is 
uncertain when the Thursday market was granted, but the' 



present fairs on the Feasts of SS Philip and James and All 
Saints were granted in 1453. Poole, as the headquarters of the 
Parliamentary forces in Dorset during the Civil War, escaped 
the siege that crippled so many of its neighbours. When 
Charles II. visited the town in 1665 a large trade was carried on 
in stockings, though the prosperity of Poole still depended on 
its usefulness as a port. 

POONA, or Puna, a city and district of British India, in 
the Central division of Bombay. The city is at the confluence 
of the Mutha and Mula rivers, 1850 ft. above sea-level and 119 m. 
S.E. from Bombay on the Great Indian Peninsula railway. 
Municipal area, about 4 sq. m.; pop. (1001), 153,320. It is 
pleasantly situated amid extensive gardens, with a large num- 
ber of modern public buildings, and also many temples and 
palaces dating from the 16th to the 19th century. The palace 
of the peshwas is a ruin, having been destroyed by fire in 1827. 
From its healthy situation Poona has been chosen not only 
as the headquarters of the 6th division of the Southern army, 
but also as the residence of the governor of Bombay during the 
rainy season, from June to September. The native town, along 
the river bank, is somewhat poorly built. The European quarter, 
including the cantonment, extends north-west towards Kirkee. 
The waterworks were constructed mainly by the munificence 
of Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy. Poona was never a great centre 
of trade or manufacture though still noted for brass-w r ork, 
jewelry and other articles of luxury. Cotton-mills, paper- 
mills, a brewery (at Dapuri), flour-mills, factories of ice and 
mineral waters, and dairy farms furnish the chief industries. 
Educational institutions are numerous. They include the 
government Deccan College, with a law class; the aided Fer- 
gusson college; the government colleges of science and agricul- 
ture; high schools; training schools for masters and mistresses; 
medical school; and municipal technical school. The recent 
history of Poona has been painfully associated with the plague. 
During 1897, when the city was first attacked, the death-rate 
rose to 93 pet 1000 in Poona city, 71 per 1000 in the canton- 
ment, and 93 per 1000 in Kirkee. 

The District of Poona has an area of 5349 sq. m. Popula- 
tion (1901), 995,330, showing an increase of 18% after the dis- 
astrous famine of 1876-1877, but a decrease of 7% in the last 
decade. Towards the west the country is undulating, and 
numerous spurs from the Western Ghats enter the district; to 
the east it opens out into plains. It is watered by many streams 
which, rising in the ghats, flow eastwards until they join the 
Bhima, a river which intersects the district from north to south. 
The principal crops are millets, pulses, oil-seeds, wheat, rice, sugar- 
cane, vegetables and fruit (including grapes). The two most 
important irrigation works in the Deccan are the Mutha canal, 
with which the Poona waterworks are connected, and the Nira 
canal. There are manufactures of cotton, silk and blankets. 
The district is traversed by the Great Indian Peninsula railway, * 
and also by the Southern Mahratta line, which starts from Poona 
city towards Satara. It is liable to drought, from which it 
suffered severely in 1866-1867, 1876-1877, and again in 
1896-1897. 

In the 17th century the district formed part of the Mabom- 
medan kingdom of Ahmadnagar. Sivaji was born within its 
boundaries at Junnar in 1627, and he was brought up at Poona 
town as the headquarters of the hereditary fief of his father. 
The district thus was the early centre of the Mahratta power; 
and when Satara became first the capital and later the prison 
of the descendants of Sivaji, Poona continued to be the seat of 
government under their hereditary ministers, with the title 
of peshwa. Many stirring scenes in Mahratta history were 
enacted here. Holkar defeated the last peshwa under its walls, 
and his flight to Bassein led to the treaty by which he put 
himself under British protection. He was reinstated in 1802, 
but, unable to maintain friendly relations, he attacked the 
British at Kirkee in 181 7, and his kingdom passed from him. 

POOP (Lat. puppis, stem), the stern or after-part of a ship; in 
the 16th and 1 7th centuries a lofty and castellated deck. The verb 
" to poop " is used of a wave breaking over the stern of a vessel.

POORE— POOR LAW 



POORE (or Poor), RICHARD (d. 1237), English bishop, was 
a son of Richard of Uchester, bishop of Winchester. About 
1 197 he was chosen dean of Samm and, after being an un- 
successful candidate for the bishoprics of Winchester and of 
Durham, he became bishop of Chichester in 1214. In 1217 he 
was translated to Salisbury, where he succeeded his elder brother, 
Herbert Poore, and in 1228 to Durham. He died at Tarrant 
Monkton, Dorset, said by some to be his birthplace, on the 15th 
of April 1237, Poore took some part in public affairs, under 
Henry III., but the great work of his life was done at Salisbury. 
Having in 1219 removed his see from Old to New Sarum, or 
Salisbury, he began the building of the magnificent cathedral 
there; he laid the foundation stone in April 1220, and during 
his episcopate he found money and forwarded the work in other 
ways. For the city the bishop secured a charter from Henry III. 
and he was responsible for the plan on which it was built, 
a plan which to some extent it still retains. He had something 
to do with drawing up some statutes for his cathedral; he is 
said to be responsible for the final form of the " use of Sarum," 
and he was probably the author of the Ancren Riwle, a, valuable 
" picture of contemporary life, manners and feeling " written 
in Middle English. His supposed identity with the jurist, 
Ricardus Anglicus, is more doubtful. 

POOR LAW. The phrase " poor law " in English usage 
denotes the legislation embodying the measures taken by the 
state for the relief of paupers and its administration. The 
history of the subject and its problems generally are dealt with 
in the article Charity and Charities, and other information 
will be found in Unemployment and Vagrancy, This article 
will deal only with the practice in the United Kingdom as 
adopted after the reform of the poor law in 1834 and amended 
by subsequent acts. This reform was brought about mainly 
by the rapid increase of the poor rate at the beginning of the 
19th century, showing that a change was necessary either 
in the poor law as it then existed or in the mode of its adminis- 
tration. 

A commission was appointed in 1832 "to make diligent and 
full inquiry into the practical operation of the laws for the 
relief of the poor in England and Wales, and into the manner in 
which those laws were administered, and to report their opinion 
as to what beneficial alterations could be made." The com- 
missioners reported " fully on the great abuse of the legislative 
provision for the poor as directed to be employed by the statute 
of Elizabeth," finding "that the great source of abuse was the 
outdoor relief afforded to the able-bodied on their own account 
or on that of their families, given cither in kind or in money. " 
They also reported that " great maladministration existed in 
the workhouses." To remedy the evils they- proposed con- 
siderable alterations in the law, and the principal portion of 
their suggestions was embodied in the Poor Law Amendment 
Act 1834. By virtue of this act three commissioners were 
appointed (originally for five years, but subsequently con- 
tinued from time to time), styled "the poor law commissioners 
for England and Wales," sitting as a board, and appointing 
assistant commissioners and other officers. The administration 
of relief according to the existing laws was subject to their 
direction and control, and to their orders and regulations for 
the government of workhouses and the guidance and control 
of guardians and vestries and the keeping and allowing of 
accounts and contracts, without interfering with ordinary relief 
in individual cases. The whole of England and Wales was 
divided into twenty-one districts, to each of which an assistant 
commissioner was appointed. The commissioners under their 
powers formed poor law unions by uniting parishes for general 
administration, and building workhouses, guardians elected by 
the ratepayers (or ex officio) having the general government 
and administration of relief. The expense was apportioned to 
each parish on settled principles and rules, with power, however, 
to treat the united parishes as one for certain purposes. Out- 
door relief might be given, on the order of two justices, to poor 
persons wholly unable to work from old age or infirmity. 

The obstacles which the act had to contend with in London 



chiefly arose from the confusion and perplexity of jurisdiction 
which existed in the one hundred and seventy parishes com- 
prised within the city of London and the metropolitan district, 
some of these containing governing bodies of their own; in some 
the parish business was professedly managed by open vestries, 
in others by select vestries, and in addition to these there were 
elective vestries, while the majority of the large parishes were 
managed under local acts by boards of directors, governor 
and trustees. These governing bodies executed a great variety 
of functions besides regulating the management of the poor. 
The power, patronage and the indirect advantages which arose 
from the administration of the local funds were so great that 
much opposition took place when it was proposed to interfere 
by constituting a board to be annually chosen and freely elected 
by the ratepayers, on which the duty of regulating the expen- 
diture for the relief of the poor was to depend. The general 
management of the poor was, however, on a somewhat better 
footing in London than in the country. 

The act of 1834 was rather to restore the scope and intention 
of the statute of Elizabeth by placing its administration in the 
hands of responsible persons chosen by the ratepayers, and 
themselves controlled by the orders of a central body, than to 
create a new system of poor laws. The agents and instruments 
by which the administration of relief is afforded are the fol- 
lowing. The description applies to the year 1910, but, as 
noticed below, the question of further reform was already to 
the fore, and the precise direction in which changes should go 
was a highly controversial matter. 

The guardians of the poor regulate the cases and description 
of relief within the union; a certain number of guardians are 
elected from time to time by the ratepayers. The 
number was formerly determined by the central uar ans ' 
board, 1 by whom full directions as to the mode of election 
were given. In addition to those elected there were ex officio 
guardians, principally local magistrates. However, both these 
and nominated guardians were done away with by the Local 
Government Act 1894. The plural vote (which gave to the 
votes of the larger ratepayers a higher value) was also abolished; 
and in place of the old property qualification for the office of 
guardian a ratepaying or residential qualification was sub- 
stituted. In urban districts the act in other respects left the 
board of guardians untouched, but in rural districts it inaugu- 
rated a policy of consolidating local authorities. In the rural 
districts the district council is practically amalgamated with the 
guardians, for, though each body retains a separate corporate 
existence, the district councillors are the guardians, and guar- 
dians as such are no longer elected. These electoral changes, 
extremely democratic in their character, brought about no 
marked general change in poor law administration. Here and 
there abrupt changes of policy were made, but the difficulty of 
bringing general principles to bear on the administration of the 
law remained much as before. 

The guardians hold their meetings frequently, according to the 
exigencies of the union. Individual cases are brought to their 
notice — most cases of resident poor by the relieving officer of 
the union; the case of casual paupers by him or by the work- 
house officers by whom they were admitted in the first instance. 
The resident poor frequently appear in person before the guar- 
dians. The mode of voting which the guardians follow in respect 
to any matter they differ on is minutely regulated, and all their 
proceedings, as well as those of their officers, are entered in pre- 
scribed books and forms. They have a clerk, generally a local 
solicitor of experience, who has a variety of responsible duties 
in advising, conducting correspondence and keeping books of 

1 After an intermediate transfer in 1847 of the powers of the 
poor law commissioners, and the- constitution of a fresh board 
styled " commissioners for administering the laws for relief of the 
poor in England," it was found expedient to concentrate in one 
department of the government the supervision of the laws relating 
to the public health, the relief of the poor and local government; 
and this concentration was in 1871 carried out by the establishment 
(by Act of Parliament 34 & 35 Vict.c. 70) of the local government 
board.

accounts, and carrying out the directions of the guardians, 
who in their turn are subject to the general or special regulations 
of the local government board. 

It may be mentioned here that the chief difficulty in under- 
standing the English poor law arises from the fact that there are 
three authorities, each of them able to alter its administration 
fundamentally. The poor law is not only the creation of 
statutes passed by parliament; it is also controlled by the 
subordinate jurisdiction of the local government board, which in 
virtue of various acts has the power to issue orders. In a 
single year the local government board may issue nearly two 
thousand orders, over a thousand of them having special reference 
to the poor law. It is not possible therefore even to summarize 
the mass of subordinate legislation. A third source of authority 
is the local board of guardians, which, within the discretion 
allowed to it by statutes and orders, can so variously administer 
the law that it is difficult to understand how procedure so 
fundamentally different can be based on one and the same law. 
This elasticity, admirable or mischievous, as wc choose to 
regard it, is the most characteristic feature of the English poor 
law system. The various officers of the union, from the medical 
officers to workhouse porters, including masters and matrons 
of workhouses, are generally appointed by the guardians, and 
the areas, duties and salaries of all the paid officers may be 
prescribed by the local government board. 

Among a multitude of miscellaneous' duties and powers of 
the guardians, apart from the ordinary duties of ordering or 
refusing relief in individual cases and superintending the officers 
of the union, the duties devolve on them of considering the 
adjustment of contributions to the common fund whether 
of divided or added parishes, and matters affecting other unions, 
the building of workhouses and raising of money for that and 
other purposes, the taking of land on lease, the hiring of buildings, 
special provisions as to superannuation and allowances to officers, 
the maintenance and orders as to lunatics apart from individual 
instances, and the consideration of questions of settlement 
and removal. A paramount obligation rests on the guardians 
to attend to the actual visitation of workhouses, schools and 
other institutions and places in which the poor are interested, 
and to call attention to and report on any irregularity or neglect 
of duty. Guardians may charge the rates with the expenses 
of attending conferences for the discussion of matters con- 
nected with their duties (Poor Law Conferences Act 1883). In 
relation to expenditure the guardians have very considerable 
but restricted powers. Their accounts are audited by district 
auditors appointed by the local government board. 

Overseers of the poor are still appointed under the statute 
of Elizabeth, and the guardians cannot interfere with the ap- 
Ove eers pointment. As, however, the relief of the poor is 
administered by boards of guardians, the principal 
duties of overseers relate to the making and collection of rates 
and payments. The guardians, by order of the local govern- 
ment board, may appoint assistant overseers and collectors. 

The conditions of persons entitled to relief are indicated by 
the terms of the statute of Elizabeth. If they fall within the 
definitions there given they have right to relief. 
ofRcitef™ A fundamental principle with respect to legal relief 
of the poor is that the condition of the pauper 
ought to be, on the whole, lgss eligible than that of the independent 
labourer. The pauper has"1i<r just ground for complaint, 
if, while his physical wants are adequately provided for, 
his condition is less eligible than that of the poorest class of 
those who contribute to his support. If a state of destitution 
exists, the failure of third persons to perform their duty, as a 
husband, or relative mentioned in the statute of Elizabeth, 
neglecting those he is under a legal obligation to support, is no 
answer to the application. The relief should be afforded, and is 
often a condition precedent to the right of parish officers to take 
proceedings against the relatives or to apply to other poor 
unions. The duty to give immediate relief must, however, 
vary with the circumstances. The case of wanderers under 
circumstances not admitting of delay may be different from 



that of persons resident on the spot where inquiry as to all the 
circumstances is practicable. The statute of Elizabeth con- 
templated that the relief was to be afforded to the poor resi- 
dent in the parish, but it is contrary to the spirit of the law that 
any person shall be permitted to perish from starvation or want 
of medical assistance. Whoever is by sudden emergency or 
urgent distress deprived of the ordinary means of subsistence 
has a right to apply for immediate relief where he may 
happen to be. Persons comprehended within this class are 
called " casual poor," although the term " casuals " is generally 
used in reference to vagrants who take refuge for a short time 
in the " casual wards " of workhouses. Various tests are 
applied to ascertain whether applicants are really destitute. 
Labour tests are applied to the able-bodied, and workhouse 
tests are applied to those to whom entering a workhouse is 
made a condition of relief. 

As to the nature and kind of relief given under the poor laws 
the great distinction restored rather than introduced by the 
amendment of the poor law system in 1834 was Nature and 
giving all relief to able-bodied persons of their Kind of 
families in well-regulated workhouses (that is to * ?r//eA 
say, places where they may be set to work according to the 
spirit and intention of the statute of Elizabeth), and confining 
outdoor relief to the impotent — that is, all except the able- 
bodied and their families. Although workhouses formed a 
conspicuous feature in legislation for the poor from an early 
period, the erection of those buildings for unions throughout 
the country where not already provided followed immediately 
on the amendment of the system in 1834. Since that time there 
has been a constant struggle between the pauper class and 
the administrators of the law, the former naturally wishing 
to be relieved at their own homes, and in many instances 
choosing rather to go without aid than to remove within 
the walls of the workhouse. Relief given in a workhouse is 
termed " in (or indoor) maintenance " relief, and when given 
at the homes of the paupers is termed " outdoor relief." 

Admission to a workhouse may be by a written order of the 
board of guardians, or by the master or matron (or in their absence 
by the porter) without an order in any case of sudden 
or urgent necessity, or provisionally by a relieving Workhouse 
officer, or overseer or churchwarden. Any person who s " 
is brought by a policeman as having been found wandering in a state 
of destitution may be admitted. It is to be observed generally, 
with respect to all persons who may apply for admission into the 
workhouse under circumstances of urgent necessity, that^ their 
destitution, coupled with the fact of being within the union cr 
parish, entitles them to relief, altogether independently of their ' 
settlement, if they have one, which is a matter for subsequent 
inquiry. 

The regulations for the government of workhouses fall under 
two classes: (1) those which are necessary for the maintenance of 
good order in any building in which considerable numbers _ of 
persons of both sexes and of different ages reside; (2) those which 
are necessary in order that these establishments may not be alms- 
houses, but workhouses in the proper meaning of the term. 

The inmates of a workhouse are necessarily^ separated into certain 
classes. In no well-managed institution of this sort, in any country, 
are males and females, the old and the young, the healthy and the 
sick, indiscriminately mixed together. Guardians are required to 
divide the paupers into certain classes, and to subdivide any one 
or more of these classes in any manner which may be advisable, 
and which the internal arrangements of the workhouse admit ; and 
the guardians are required from time to time, after consulting the 
medical officer, to make necessary arrangements with regard to per- 
sons labouring under any disease of body or mind, and, so far as cir- 
cumstances permit, to subdivide any of the enumerated classes with 
reference to the moral character or behaviour or the previous habits 
of the inmates, or to such other grounds as may seem expedient. 

The separation of married couples was long a vexed question, the 
evils on the one hand arising from the former unrestricted practice 
being very great, while on the other hand the separation of old 
couples was felt as a great hardship, and by express statutory pro- 
vision in 1847 husband and wife, both being above the age of sixty, 
received into a workhouse cannot be compelled to live separate and 
apart from each other (10 & n Vict. c. 109, § 23). This exemption 
was carried somewhat further by contemporaneous orders of the 
board, under which guardians were not compelled to separate infirm 
couples, provided they had a sleeping apartment separate from that 
of other paupers; and in 1876 guardians were empowered, at their 
discretion, to permit husband and wife where either of them is 



76 

infirm, sick or disabled by any injury, or above sixty years of age 
to live together, but every such case must be reported to the local 
government board (39 & 40 Vict. c. 61, § 10). 

The classification of children apart from adult paupers is per- 
emptory. Even in those unions where what is called a workhouse 
school is maintained the children are kept in detached parts of 
the building, and do not associate with the adult paupers. The 
separate school is built on a separate and often distant site. Some- 
times the separate school is one building, sometimes detached 
11 blocks," and sometimes a group of cottage homes. There still 
remain ten district schools. In some places an experiment which 
is called the scattered homes system has been^ adopted. This 
consists in lodging-homes for the children placed in different parts 
of the town, from which the children attend the local public ele- 
mentary schools. In the rural districts and in less populous unions 
the children generally attend the local public elementary school. 
To these expedients boarding-out must be^ added. The above 
refers of course only to those children who as inmates are under the 
charge of the guardians. Outdoor paupers are responsible for 
the education of their children, but guardians cannot legally continue 
outdoor relief if the children are not sent regularly to school. 

The tendency too has been to improve administrative methods 
with reference to children. 

Two important orders on the subject of the boarding-out of poor- 
law children were issued in 1889. By the Boarding of Children in 
Unions Order, orphan and deserted children can be boarded out 
with suitable foster-parents in the union by all boards of guardians 
except those in the metropolis. This can be done either through 
a voluntary committee or directly. By the Boarding Out Order, 
orphan and deserted children may be boarded out by all boards of 
guardians without the limits of their own unions, but in all cases 
this must be done through the offices of properly constituted local 
boarding-out committees. The sum payable to the foster-parents 
is not to exceed 4s. per week for each child. The local committee 
require to be approved by the Local Government Board. 

The question of the education of poor law children was much 
discussed in later years. During the early years of the central 
authority, it was the object of the commissioners to induce boards 
of guardians to unite in districts for educational purposes. This 
was advocated on grounds of efficiency and economy. It was very 
unpopular with the local authorities, and the number of such 
districts has never exceeded a, dozen. In London, where this 
aggregation was certainly less desirable than in rural unions, several 
districts were formed and large district schools were built. Adverse 
criticism, by Mrs Nassau Senior in 1874, and by a department 
committee appointed twenty years later, was directed against these 
large, or, as they are invidiously called, barrack schools. The 
justice of this condemnation has been disputed, but it seems 
probable that some of these schools had grown too large. Many 
of these have been^ dissolved by order of the local government 
board on the application of the unions concerned. This con- 
demnation of some schools has in certain quarters been extended 
to all schools, and is construed by others as an unqualified 
recommendation of boarding out, a method of bringing up poor law 
children obviously requiring even more careful supervision than is 
• needed in the publicity of a school. 

Other acts to be noted are the Poor Law Act 1880, and the Custody 
of Children Act 1891, § 3. The evil of allowing children who 
have been reputably brought up in poor law schools to relapse 
into vicious habits on return to the custody of unworthy parents 
has been the subject of frequent remark. By the act of 1889, 
guardians are authorized to detain children who are under their 
charge, as having been deserted by their parents, up to the age of 
16 if boys and of 18 if girls. By the Poor Law Act 1899 the 
principle is extended to orphans and the children of bad parents 
chargeable to the rates. The act of 1891 goes further, and enacts 
that where a parent has (a) abandoned or deserted his child, or 
(b) allowed his child to be brought up by another person at that 
person's expense, or by the guardians of a poor law union for such 
a length of time and in such circumstances as to satisfy the court 
that the parent was unmindful of his parental duties, the court 
shall not make an order for the delivery of the child to the parent 
unless the parent has satisfied the court that, having regard to the 
welfare of the child, he is a fit person to have the custody of the 
child. 

Casual and poor wayfarers admitted by the master and matron 
are kept in a separate ward and dieted and set to work in such 
manner as the guardians by resolution direct; and whenever any 
vagrants or mendicants are received into a workhouse they are 
usually (as a precaution necessary for preventing the introduction 
of infectious or contagious diseases) kept entirely separate from the 
other inmates, unless their stay exceeds a single night. 

For the guidance of guardians an important circular was issued 
from the local government board on the 15th of March 1886. It 
stated that while " the board have no doubt that the powers which 
the guardians possess are fully sufficient to enable them to deal 
with ordinary pauperism, and to meet the demand for relief from 
the classes who usually seek it," yet " these provisions do not in 
all cases meet the emergency. What is required to relieve artisans 
and others who have hitherto avoided poor law assistance, and who 



POOR LAW

Relief, 



are temporarily deprived of employment, is — (1) Work which will 
not involve the stigma of pauperism; (2) work which all can per- 
form, whatever may have been their previous occupations; (3) 
work which docs not compete with that of other labourers at 
present in employment; and lastly, work which is not likely 
to interfere with the resumption of regular employment in their 
own trades by those who seek it." 

The circular went on to recommend that guardians should confer 
with the local authorities, *' and endeavour to arrange with the 
latter for the execution of works on which unskilled labour may 
be immediately employed." The conditions of such work were 

(1) the men to be employed must be recommended by the guardians; 

(2) the wages must be less than the wages ordinarily paid for such 
work. 

The circular was widely distributed. Many boards that were 
inclined in that direction regarded it as an encouragement to open 
or to promote the opening of relief works. Others, again, looked 
closely at the conditions, and declared roundly that it was impos- 
sible to fulfil them. A poor law authority, they said, cannot give 
relief which will not subject the recipients to the legal (if any) and 
economic disabilities attaching to the receipt of poor law relief. 
Work which all can perform can only be found in the shape of 
task-work under adequate supervision. If the work is of a useful 
and necessary character, it must compete with the labour of others 
belonging to the trades affected. If the relief works are opened by 
authorities other than the poor law guardians, the conditions that 
the men were only to be employed when recommended by the 
guardians, and then paid less than the current rate of wages, were 
calculated, it was urged, to secure bad work, discontent, and all 
the " stigma of pauperism." The ambiguity of the circular indeed 
was such, that both action and inaction seem amply justified by it. 

In the administration of medical relief to the sick, the objects 
kept in view are: (1) to provide medical aid for persons who are 
really destitute, and (2) to prevent medical relief from 
generating ^ or encouraging pauperism, and with this 
view to withdraw from the labouring classes, as well 
as from the administrators of relief and the medical officers, all 
motives for applying for or administering medical relief, unless 
where the circumstances render it absolutely necessary. 

Unions are formed into medical districts limited in area and 
population, to which a paid medical officer is appointed, who is 
furnished with a list of all such aged and infirm persons and persons 
permanently sick or disabled as are actually receiving relief and 
residing within the medical officer's district. Every person named 
in the list receives a ticket, and on exhibiting it to* the medical 
officer is entitled to advice, attendance^ and medicine as his case 
may require. Medical outdoor relief in connexion with dispen- 
saries is regulated in asylum districts of the metropolis by the 
Metropolitan Poor Act 1867 (30 & 31 Vict. c. 6). In connexion 
with medical relief must be noted the Medical Relief Disqualifica- 
tion Removal Act 1885. This act relieved voters from disquali- 
fication which would otherwise attach in consequence of the receipt 
by them or their families of medical or surgical assistance, or of 
medicine, at the expense of the poor rate. This does not apply 
to guardian elections, and it does not include persons who, in 
addition to medical relief, receive nourishment or other relief from 
the poor rate. The provisions which require the removal of the 
names of paupers from the electoral roll are, it is understood, very 
perfunctorily carried out. The^ Outdoor Relief Friendly Societies 
Act 1894 authorized guardians, in calculating the proper allowance 
to be made, to disregard an income derived from a friendly society, 
and to give relief as if the applicant in receipt of such an allowance 
was wholly destitute. This act is^ a curious illustration of the 
English poor law system. In earlier years, notably in what is 
known as Paget's letter (22nd Rep. Poor Law Board, p. 108), the 
central board, had, in answer to inquiry, pointed out that such 
preferential treatment given to men receiving benefit, insufficient 
to maintain them, from a friendly society, could not in equity 
be withheld from persons in receipt of an adequate benefit, or from 
those whose savings took the form of a deposit in a bank, of a share 
in a co-operative society, or of cottage property ; and further, that 
an engagement on the part of guardians to supplement insufficient 
allowance from a friendly society was a bounty on inadequate and 
insolvent friendly society finance. The central board went so 
far as to say that relief given in such disregard of the pauper's 
income was illegal. They had, however, issued no peremptory 
order on the subject, nor had guardians been surcharged for neglect 
of the rule. The local authorities followed their own discretion, 
and a very general practice was to reckon friendly society allowances 
at half their value. The above act set aside the central board's 
earlier interpretation of the law. It made, however, no attempt 
to enforce its procedure on the numerous boards of guardians who 
regard the course thereby authorized as contrary to'public policy. 

A lunatic asylum is required to be provided by a county or 
borough for the reception of pauper lunatics, with a committee of 
visitors who, among other duties, fix a weekly sum to ^ una ti CSt 
be charged for the lodging, maintenance, medicine and 
clothing of each pauper lunatic confined in such asylum. Several 
acts were passed. The Lunacy Act 1800 consolidated the acts 
affecting lunatics. It was further amended: by the Lunacy Act 1891.

An explanatory letter issued by the local government board will 
be found in the 20th Annual Report, p. 23. The tendency of this and 
of all recent legislation for an afflicted class has been to increase the 
care and the safeguards for their proper treatment. 

A settlement is the right acquired in any one of the modes pointed 
out by the poor laws to become a recipient of the benefit of those 
laws in that parish or place where the right has been last acquired. 

No relief is given from the poor rates of a parish to any person 
who does not reside within the union, except where such person 
The Que*- being casually within a parish becomes destitute by 
tloaot sudden distress, or where such person is entitled to 

"Settle* receive relief from any parish where non-resident 
meat'* under justice's order (applicable to persons under" 

orders of removal and to non-resident lunatics), and except to 
widows and legitimate children where the widow was resident with 
her husband at the time of his death out of the union in which she 
was not settled, or where a child under sixteen is maintained in a 
workhouse or establishment for the education of pauper children 
not situate in the union, and in some other exceptional cases. 

Immediately before the passing of the Poor Law Amendment 
Act 1834 settlements were acquired by birth, hiring and service , 
apprenticeship, renting a tenement, estate, office or payment of 
rates. In addition to these an acknowledgment (by certificate), by 
relief or acts of acquiescence) has practically the effect of a settle- 
ment, for, if unexplained, such an acknowledgment stops the parish 
from disputing a settlement in the parish acknowledging. The 
Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 abolished settlement by hiring 
and service (or by residence under it) and by serving an office, and 
by apprenticeship in the sea service. Moreover the guardians of 
a union might agree (subject to the approval of the commissioners) 
that all the parishes forming it should for the purposes of settle- 
ment be considered as one parish. 

It is to be observed that, for the purposes of relief, settlement 
and removal and burial, the workhouse of any parish is considered 
as situated in the parish to which each poor person is chargeable. 

There may be a settlement by parentage, for legitimate children 
take the settlement of their father, or if he has no settlement they 
are entitled to the settlement of their mother; and it is only when 
both these sources fail discovery that their right of settlement by 
birth accrues; for until the settlement of the Father or mother has 
been ascertained the settlement of a legitimate child, like that of a 
bastard, is in the place where the birth took place. 

A settlement attaches to those persons who have a settlement of 
some kind. Foreigners born out of the country and not acquiring 
any in one of the modes pointed out must be provided for, if requiring 
relief, where they happen to be. 

As the burden of maintaining^ the poor is thrown on the parish 
of settlement, when the necessity for immediate relief arises in 
another parish, the important question arises whether the pauper 
can be removed; for, although the parish where the pauper happens 
to be must afford immediate relief without waiting for removal, 
the parish of settlement cannot in general be charged with the 
cosf unless the pauper is capable of being removed. The question 
of removability is distinct from settlement.^ A pauper often 
acquires a status or irremovability without gaining a settlement. # 

Irremovability is a principle of great public importance quite 
irrespective of the incident of cost as between one parish or another. 
Before the introduction of a status of irremovability removal might 
take place (subject to powers of suspension in case of sickness and 
otherwise) after any interval during which no legal settlement 
was obtained; mere length of residence without concurrent cir- 
cumstances involving the acquisition of a settlement on obtaining 
relief gave no right to a person to remain in the parish where he 
resided. 

In 1846 it was enacted that no person should be removed nor 
any warrant granted for the removal of any person from any parish 
in which such persons had resided for five years (9 & 10 Vict. c. 66). 
In 1861 three years was submitted for five (24 & 25 Vict. c. 55); 
and only four years later one year was substituted for three (28 & 
29 Vict. c. 79). Apart from these reductions of time in giving 
the status of irremovability, actual removals to the parish of settle- 
ment were narrowed by provisions giving to residence in any 
part of a union the same effect as a residence in any parish of that 
union (24 & 25 Vict. c. 55).* On the other hand the time during 
which parish relief is received, or during which the person is in any 
poorhouse or hospital or in a prison, is excluded from the computa- 
tion of time (9 & 10 Vict. c. 66). 

The removability as well as the settlement of the family, i.e. 
of the wife and unemancipated children, are practically subject to 
one and the same general rule. Wherever any person has a wife 
or children having another settlement, they are removable where 
he is removable, and are not removable from any parish or place 
from which he is not removable (11 & t2 Vict. c. 2 ti). 

It is to be borne in mind that no person exempted from liability 
to be removed acquires, by reason of such exemption, any settle- 
ment in any parish ; but a residence for three years gives a qualified 
settlement (39 & 40 Vict. c. 6t). 

The cost of relief of paupers rendered irremovable is borne by the 
common fund of the union (t 1 & 1 2 Vict. c. 1 10, § 3) as union expenses 
(§ 6), and any question arising in the union with reference to the 



charging relief may be referred to and decided by the local govern- 
ment board (§4). 

The poor rate is the fund from which the cost of relief is princi- 
pally derived. The statute of Elizabeth (extended in some respects 
as to places by 13 & 14 Charles II. c. 12) embraced ^^n.* 
two classes of persons subject to taxation — occupiers ** 

of real property and inhabitants in respect of personal property, 
although trie ratcability under the latter head was reluctantly 
conceded by the courts of law, and was in practice only partially 
acted upon. 

As regards occupiers of land and houses, the correct principles as 
to the persons liable to be rated were, after many erroneous views 
and decisions, established by the House of Lords in 1865 in the 
case of the Mersey docks. The only occupier exempt from the 
operation of the act of Elizabeth is the Crown, on the general prin- 
ciple that such liabilities are not imposed on the sovereign unless 
expressly mentioned, and that principle applies to the direct and 
immediate servants of the Crown, whose occupation is the occupa- 
tion of the Crown itself. If there is a personal private beneficial 
occupation, so that the occupation is by the subject, that occupa- 
tion is rateable. Thus for apartments in a royal palace, gratui- 
tously assigned to a subject, who occupies them by permission of 
the sovereign but for the subject's benefit, the latter is rateable; 
on the other hand, where a lease of private property is taken in 
the name of a subject, but the occupation is by the sovereign or 
his subjects on his behalf, no rate can be imposed. 

So far the ground of exemption is perfectly intelligible, but it 
has been carried a good deal further, and applied to many cases in 
which it can scarcely be said naturally, but only theoretically, that 
the sovereign or the servants of the sovereign are in occupation. 
A long series of cases have established that when property is occu- 
pied tor the purposes of the government of the country, including 
under that head the police, and the administration 01 justice, no 
one is rateable in respect of such occupation. And this applies not 
only to property occupied for such purposes by the servants of the 
great departments of state and the post office, the Horse Guards, and 
the Admiralty, in all which cases the occupiers might strictly be 
called the servants of the Crown, but to county buildings occupied 
for the assizes ano! for the judge's lodgings, to stations for the local 
constabulary, to jails and to county courts where undertakings 
are carried out by or for the government and the government is in 
occupation; the same principles of exemption have been applied 
to property held by the office of works. 

When the property is not de facto occupied by the Crown or for 
the Crown, it is rateable; and, although formerly the uses of property 
for public purposes, even where the Crown was not constructively 
interested in the way above pointed out, was treated as a ground 
for exemption, it is now settled that trustees who are in law the 
tenants and occupiers of valuable property in trust for public and 
even charitable purposes, such as hospitals or lunatic asylums, are 
in principle rateable notwithstanding that the buildings are actually 
occupied by paupers who are sick or insane, and that the notion 
that persons in the legal occupation of valuable property are not 
rateable if they occupy in a merely fiduciary character cannot be 
sustained. 

With respect to the particular person to be rated where there is 
a rateable occupation, it is to be observed that the tenant, as dis- 
tinguished from the landlord, is the person to be rated under the 
statute of Elizabeth ; but occupiers of tenements let for short terms 
may deduct the poor rate paid by them from their rents, or the 
vestries may order such owners to be rated instead of the occupiers; 
such payments or deductions do not affect qualification and fran- 
chises depending on rating (Poor Rate Assessment and Collection 
Act 1869 and Amendment Act 1882). 

To be rated the occupation must be such as to be of value, and 
in this sense the word beneficial occupation has been used in many 
cases. But it is not necessary that the occupation should be bene- 
ficial to the occupier; for, if that were necessary, trustees occupying 
for various purposes, having no beneficial occupation, would not be 
liable, and their general liability has been established as indicated 
in the examples just given. . 

As to the mode and amount of rating it is no exaggeration to 
say that the application of a landlord-and-tenant valuation in the 
terms already given in the Parochial Assessment Act, with the 
deductions there mentioned, has given rise to litigation on which 
millions of pounds have been spent with respect to the rating of 
railways alone, although the established principle applied to them, 
after much consideration, is to calculate the value of the land as 
increased by the line. 

The Parochial Assessment Act referred to (6 & 7 Will. IV. c. 96), 
comprising various provisions as to the mode of assessing the rate 
so far as it authorized the making of a valuation, was repealed in 
1869, in relation to the metropolis, and other provisions made for 
securing uniformity of the assessment of rateable property there 
(32 & 33 Vict. c. 67). 

The mode in which a rate is made and recovered may be concisely 
stated thus. The guardians appoint an assessment committeeof 
their body for the investigation and supervision of valuations, which 
are made out in the first instance by the overseers according to specific 
regulations and in a form showing among other headings the gross 



78 



POOR LAW 



estimated rental of all property and the names of occupiers and 
owners, and the rateable value after the deductions specified in the 
Assessment Act already mentioned, and as prescribed by the central 
board. This valuation list, made and signed by the overseers, is 
published, and all persons assessed or liable to be assessed, and other 
interested parties, may, including the officers of other parishes, 
inspect and take copies of and extracts from that list. A multitude 
of provisions exist in relation to the valuation and supplemental 
valuation lists. Objections on the ground of unfairness or incorrect- 
ness are dealt with by the committee, who hold meetings to hear 
and determine such objections. The valuation list, where approved 
by the committee, is delivered to the overseers, who proceed to 
make the rate in accordance with the valuation lists and in a 
prescribed form of rate book. The parish officers certify to the 
examination and comparison of the rate book with the assessments, 
and obtain the consent of justices as required by the statute of 
Elizabeth. This consent or allowance of the rate is merely a 
ministerial act, and if the rate is good on the face of it the justices 
cannot inquire into its validity. 

The rate is then published and open to inspection. Appeals may 
be made to special or quarter sessions against the rate, subject to the 
restriction that, if the objection were such that it might have been 
dealt with on the valuation lists, no appeal to sessions is permitted 
unless the valuation list has been duly objected to and the objector 
had failed to obtain such relief in the matter as.he deemed to be just. 

In the metropolis a common basis of value for the purposes of 
government and local taxation is provided, including the promotion 
of uniformity in the assessment of rateable property. Provision is 
made for the appointment of an assessment committee by guardians 
or vestries, and for the preparation of valuation lists, and the 
deposit and distribution of valuation lists, and for the periodical 
revision of valuation lists. 

Many endeavours have been made to readjust the burden of 
local expenditure. The system of making grants from the national 
taxes in aid of local rates has been extended. The principle of the 
metropolitan common poor fund, a device for giving metropolitan 
grants assessed onthe whole of London in aid of the London local 
poor law authorities, has been followed, mutatis mutandis, in the 
relations between the national and the local exchequers. At the 
time of the repeal of the corn laws, Sir Robert Peel expressed an 
opinion that this fiscal change necessitated some readjustment 
of local rates. In that year, 1846, a beginning of grants from the 
national exchequer in aid of local expenditure was made. The 
salaries of poor-law teachers, medical officers and auditors were 
provided from the larger area of taxation, and in 1867 the salaries 
of public vaccinators were added to the list. In 1874 a grant of 
4s. per head per week was made for each pauper lunatic passed by 
the guardians to the care of a lunatic asylum. By the Local 
Government Act 1888, supplemented by the Local Taxation 
(Customs and Excise) Act 1890, this principle was more widely 
extended. The various grants in aid were abolished, and in 
substitution the proceeds of certain specified taxes were set aside 
for local purposes. From this source, the gross amount of which 
of course varies, there are now distributed to local poor-law authori- 
ties some 4s. a week for lunatics in asylums, and allowances based 
on their average expenditure in previous years in salaries of officials 
and other specified charges. In London, in order not to conflict 
with the operation of the common poor fund, which had already 
spread these charges over a wide area, the grant takes the form 
of a sum equivalent to about 4d. per diem for each indoor pauper. 
The number on which this calculation is based is not, however, to 
be the actual number, but the average of the last five years previous 
to the passing of the act. By this legislation something like one- 
quarter of the total expenditure on poor law relief is obtained from 
national taxes as opposed to local rates. By the Agricultural 
Rates Act 1896 the occupier of agricultural land was excused 
one-half of certain rates, including the poor rate. The deficiency 
is supplied by a contribution from the national exchequer. 
Meanwhile, the spending authority continue to be elected by the 
local ratepayers. In this connexion two further anomalies deserve 
notice. By the Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act 1869 
owners who compound to pay the rates in respect of tenement 
property are entitled to certain deductions by way of commission. 
Such payments by the owner are constructively payments by the 
occupier, who thereby is to be deemed duly rated for any qualifi- 
cation or franchise. Under these arrangements a large number 
of electors do not contribute directly to the rate. A converse 
process is also going on, whereby the ownership of an important 
and increasing body of property is practically unrepresented. 
This is due to the great growth of property in the hands of railway 
companies, docks and limited liability companies generally. The 
railways alone are said to pay considerably over 13% of the local 
taxation of the country, and they have no local representation. 
Thereis, in fact, in local administration a divorce between repre- 
sentation and taxation to a greater extent than is generally supposed, 
and it is impossible not to connect the fact with the rapid growth of 
local expenditure and indebtedness. 

Royal Commission of 1 905-1 pop.— The main points of the 
system of English poor relief, as still in force in 1910, are as 



outlined above. That it has been inadequate in dealing with 
the various problems of unemployment and pauperism, which the 
constantly changing conditions of the industrial world necessarily 
evolve had however been long acknowledged. Accordingly, 
in 1905 a royal commission was appointed to inquire into the 
working of the law relating to the relief of poor persons, and 
into the various means adopted outside of the poor laws for 
meeting distress arising from want of employment, particularly 
during the periods of severe industrial depression. The commis- 
sion took voluminous evidence 1 and its report was issued in

1909. It consists of a majority report, signed by the chairman 
and 13 other members, and a minority report signed by 4 dis- 
sentient members. To this report and its appendices those 
who wish to obtain an exhaustive account of the working of 
the English poor law must necessarily have recourse. 

The " majority " report opens with a statistical survey of 
poor law problems, gives an historical sketch of the poor laws 
Majority down to 1834, and proceeds to deal in detail with 
Report. the historical development and present condition 
of the various branches of the poor law under their appro- 
priate headings: (a) the central authority; (b) the local 
authority; (c) the officers of the local authority; (<£) areas of 
administration; (e) indoor relief; (/) outdoor relief; (g) the aged; 
(/i) the children; (i) the able-bodied under the poor law and 
(/) the causes of pauperism. Other portions of the report 
deal with medical relief, distress due to unemployment, and 
charities and the relief of distress. In reviewing these various 
subjects the commission lay bare the main defects of the 
present system, which they briefly summarize as follows: — 

i. The inadequacy of existing poor law areas to meet the 
growing needs of administration, 
ii. The excessive size of many boards of guardians, 
iii. The absence of any general interest in poor law work 
and poor law elections, due in great part to the fact that poor 
law stands in no organic relation to the rest of local govern- 
ment. 

iv. The lack of intelligent uniformity in the application 
of principles and in general administration. 

v. The want of proper investigation and discrimination 
in dealing with applicants. 

vi. The tendency in many boards of guardians to give out- 
door relief without plan or purpose. 

vii. The unsuitability of the general workhouse as a test 
or deterrent for the able-bodied; the aggregation in it of all 
classes without sufficient classification; and the absence of any 
system of friendly and restorative help, 
viii. The lack of co-operation between poor law and charity. 
ix. The tendency of candidates to make lavish promises 
of out-relief and of guardians to favour their constituents in 
its distribution. 

x. General failure to attract capable social workers and 
leading citizens. 

xi. The general rise in expenditure, not always accompanied 
by an increase of efficiency in administration. 

xii. The want of sufficient control and continuity of policy 
on the part of the central authority. 

The commission stated that these defects have produced a 
want of confidence in the local administration of the poor law, 
and that they have been mainly the cause of the introduction 
of other forms of relief from public funds which are unaccom- 
panied by such conditions as are imperatively necessary as 
safeguards. 

The commission proceed to formulate a scheme of reform, the 
main features of which are summarized below: — 

Public Assistance.— rThc commissioners state that the name 
" poor law " has gathered about it associations of harshness, and 
still more of hopelessness, which might seriously obstruct the 
reforms they recommend, and they suggest that the title " public 
assistance " better expresses the system of help outlined in their 
report. They propose the abolition of the existing boards of 
guardians, the separation of their duties into two categories, and 
the calling into existence of two bodies for the discharge of the 
two sets of functions, viz. a local authority, known as the public 
assistance authority, with an area conterminous with the area 
of the county or county borough, for central administration and 
control; and local committees in existing union area.- for dealing 
with applications, investigating and supervising cases and undcr- 
taking such other duties as may be delegated by the public assistance 
authority. They recommend that the public assistance authority 
should be a statutory committee of the County Council, with one-half 
of its members appointed by the council from persons who are 
members of the council, and the other half of its members appointed 
by the council from outside their number, and to consist of persons 
experienced in the local administration of public assistance or 

Relief, with a memorandum on the Relief of Famines in India; vol. 
xxxiv. Alphabetical Lists of Oral and Non-oral Witnesses. 



other cognate work, women to be eligible for appointment in 
either case. 

Working in co-operation with the public assistance authorities 
are to be voluntary aid councils and committees (the former super- 
vising, the latter executive) for aiding persons in distress whose 
cases do not appear to be suitable for treatment by the public 
assistance committee. The commission epitomize what they 
consider to be the main principles of a reformed poor law. They 
arc (1) that the treatment of the poor who apply for public assistance 
should be adapted to the needs of the individual, and, if institutional, 
should be governed by classification; (2) that the public adminis- 
tration established for the assistance of the poor should work in 
co-operation with the local and private charities of the district; 
(3) that the system of public assistance thus established should 
include processes of help which would be preventive, curative, and 
restorative, and (4) that every effort should be made to foster the 
instincts of independence and self-maintenance amongst those 
assisted. They proceed to recommend : — 

Indoor or ['Institutional" Relief. — That general workhouses 
should be abolished. That indoor relief should be given in separate 
institutions appropriate to the following classes of applicants, 
viz. (a) children, (5) aged and infirm, (c) sick, (d) able-bodied men, 
(e) able-bodied women, (/) vagrants, and (g) feeble-minded and 
epileptics. Powers of removal to and detention in institutions 
should be given, with proper safeguards, to the public assistance 
authority. The treatment of inmates should be made as far as 
possible curative and restorative. 

Outdoor Relief or " Home Assistance" — This should be given only 
after thorough inquiry, except in eases of sudden and urgent 
necessity; it should be adequate to meet the needs of those to whom 
it is given; persons so assisted should be subject to supervision; 
that such supervision should include in its purview the conditions, 
moral and sanitary, under which the recipient is living; that 
voluntary agencies should be utilized as far as possible for the 
personal care of individual cases, and that there should be one 
uniform order governing outdoor relief or home assistance. 

Children. — Effective steps should be taken to secure that the 
maintenance of children in the workhouse be no longer recognized 
as a legitimate way of dealing with them. Boarding-out might 
and should be greatly extended. Power to adopt children of 
vicious parents should be more frequently exercised and accom- 
panied by a strict dealing with the parent, and the public assistance 
authorities should retain supervision of adopted children up to the 
age of twenty-one. A local government board circular of June 
10,10 to boards of guardians embodied many of the recommenda- 
tions of the commission. Some recommendations, of course, the 
guardians are not empowered, under existing legislation, to carry out. 

The Aged. — As regards institutional relief, the aged should 
have accommodation and treatment apart from the able-bodied, 
and be housed on a separate site, and be further subdivided into 
classes as far as practicable with reference to their physical condition 
and their moral character. As regards outdoor relief, greater 
care should be taken to ensure adequacy of relief. 

Medical Relief or Assistance. — A general system of provident 
dispensaries should be established, of which existing voluntary 
outdoor medical organizations should be invited to form an integral 

Eart, and every inducement should be offered to the working classes 
elow a certain wage to become, or continue to be, members of a 
provident dispensary. 

Unemployment. — The commission review the social and industrial 
developments since 183.J, deal with the new problems, criticize the 
existing methods of relief, and on their summing up of the new 
factors and developments, arrive at the conclusions: (a) that there 
is an increasing aggregation of unskilled labour at the great ports 
and in certain populous districts; (6) that this aggregation of 
low-grade labour is so much in excess of the normal local wants as 
to promote and perpetuate under-employment, and (c) that this 
normal condition of under-employment, when aggravated by periodic 
contraction of trade or by inevitable changes in methods of pro- 
duction, assumes such dimensions as to require special machinery 
and organization for its relief and treatment. The commission 
proceed to make the following recommendations: — 

Labour Exchanges. — A national system of labour exchanges 
should be established and worked by the board of trade for the 
general purpose of assisting the mobility of labour and of collecting 
accurate information as to unemployment. (These were established 
by the Labour Exchanges Act 1909; see Unemployment.) 

Education and Training of the Young for Industrial Life. — The 
education in the public elementary schools should be much less 
literary and more practical, and better calculated than at present 
to adapt the child to its future occupation. Boys should be kept 
at school until the age of fifteen; exemption below fifteen should be 
granted only for boys leaving to learn a skilled trade, and there 
should be school supervision till sixteen and replacing in school if not 
properly employed. 

Regularization of Employment. — Government departments and 
local and public authorities should be enjoined to regularize their 
work as far as possible, and to endeavour, as far as possible, to 
undertake their irregular work when the general demand for labour 
is slack. 



8o 



POPAYAN 



Unemployment Insurance. — The establishment and promotion 
of unemployment insurance, especially amongst unskilled and 
unorganized labour, is of paramount importance in ^ averting 
distress arising from unemployment, and is of such national im- 
portance as to justify, under specified conditions, contributions 
from public funds towards its furtherance. The commission 
further state that this insurance can best be promoted by utilizing 
the agency of existing trade organizations, or of organizations of* 
a similar character. They are of opinion that no scheme of 
unemployment insurance, either foreign or British, which has been 
brought before them, is so free from objections as to justify them 
in recommending it for general adoption. 

Labour Colonies. — The commission recommend their establish- 
ment and use. (For .these see Vagrancy.) 

Four out of the seventeen members of the commission, being 
unable to agree with their colleagues, issued a separate report, 
which is very nearly as voluminous as that of the 
Report? majority. Their recommendations were more drastic 
than those of the majority, and had for their aim 
not a reform of the poor law as it exists, but its entire break- 
up. The minority agree with the majority in recommending 
the abolition of workhouses, but instead of setting up new 
authorities, they consider that the duties of the guardians should 
be transferred to the county authorities, with an appropriate 
distribution among four existing committees of the county 
council. They recommend that the education committee 
become responsible for the entire care of children of school 
age. That the health committee should care for the sick and 
permanently incapacitated, infants under school age, and the 
aged requiring institutional care. The asylums committee 
should have charge of the mentally defective and the 
pension committee of the aged to whom pensions are awarded. 

The minority consider there should be some systematic co- 
ordination, within each local area, of all forms of public assis- 
tance and, if possible, of all assistance dispensed by voluntary 
agencies, and they recommend the appointment, by the county 
or county borough council, of one or more responsible officers, 
called " registrars of public assistance." Their duties would 
be to keep a register of all persons receiving any form of public 
assistance within their districts; they would assess the charge 
to be made on individuals liable to pay any part of the cost 
of the service rendered to them or their dependants, and re- 
cover the amount thus due. They would also have to consider 
the proposals of the various committees of the council for the 
payment of out-relief, or, as the minority prefer to term it, 
" home aliment." Other various duties are allotted to them 
in the report. 

The subject of unemployment was considered by the minority 
and they made the following recommendations: — 



Ministry of Labour. — The duty of organizing the national labour 
market should be placed upon a minister responsible to parliament. 
The ministry of labour should have six distinct and separately 



organized divisions; viz. the national labour exchange; the trade 
insurance division; the maintenance and training division; the 
industrial regulation division; the emigration and immigration 
division, and the statistical division. 

National Labour Exchange. — The function of the national labour 
exchange should be, not only, (a) to ascertain and report the surplus 
or shortage of labour of particular kinds, at particular places; and 
(b) to diminish the time and energy now spent in looking for work, 
and the consequent leaking between jobs; but also (c) so to dovetail 
casual and seasonal employments as to arrange for practical con- 
tinuity of work for those now chronically unemployed. 

Absorption of Surplus Labour. — To reduce the surplus of labour 
the minority recommend (a) that no child should be employed, in 
any occupation whatsoever, below the age of fifteen; no young 
person under eighteen for more than thirty hours per week, and all 
so employed should be required to attend some suitable public 
institution for not less than thirty hours per week for physical 
training and technical education; (b) the hours of labour of railway, 
omnibus and tramway employees should be reduced to a maximum 
of sixty, if not of forty-eight in any one week; and (c) wage-earnipg 
mothers of young children should be withdrawn from the industrial 
world by giving them sufficient public assistance for the support of 
their families. 

Regularization of the National Demand for Labour. — In order to 
meet the periodically recurrent general depressions of trade the 
government should take advantage of there being at these periods 
as much unemployment of capital as there is unemployment of 
labour; that it should definitely undertake, as far as practicable, 



the regularization of the national demand for labour; and that it 
should, for this purpose, and to the extent of at least £4,000,000 a 
year, arrange a portion of the ordinary work required by each 
department on a ten years' programme ; £4.0,000,000 worth of work 
for the decade being then put in hand, not by equal annual instal- 
ments, but exclusively in the lean years of the trade cycle; being 
paid for out of loans for short terms raised as they are required, 
and being executed with the best available labour, at standard 
rates, engaged in the ordinary way. That in this ten years' 
programme there should be included works of afforestation, coast 
protection and land reclamation; to be carried out by the board 
of agriculture exclusively in the lean years of the trade cycle; by 
the most suitable labour obtainable, taken on in the ordinary way 
at the rates locally current for the work, and paid for out of loans 
raised as required. 

Trade Union Insurance.— -In view of its probable adverse effect 
on trade union membership and organization the minority com- 
missioners cannot recommend the establishment of any plan of 
government or compulsory insurance against unemployment. 
They recommend, however, a government subvention not exceeding 
one half of the sum actually paid in the last preceding year as out- 
of-work benefit should be offered to trade unions or other societies 
providing such benefit. 

Maintenance and Training. — For the ultimate residuum of men 
in distress from want of employment the minority recommend 
that maintenance should be freely provided, without disfranchise- 
ment, on condition that they submit themselves to the physical 
and mental training that they may prove to require. Suitable 
day training depots or residential farm colonies should be estab- 
lished, where the men's whole working time would be absorbed 
in such varied beneficial training of body and mind as they proved 
capable of; their wives and families being, meanwhile, provided 
with adequate home aliment. 

Authorities. — The Report and Evidence of the Royal Com- 
mission of 1905-1909 is a library in itself on the subject of pauperism. 
The contents of the various volumes are given supra. Other im- 
portant publications are Report and Evidence of Royal Commission 
on Aged Poor (1895) ; Report and Evidence of Select Committee of House 
of Commons on Distress from Want of Employment (1895); Report 
of Departmental Committee on Vagrancy (1906). See also the 
references in the bibliography to Charity and Charities; and

POPAYAN, a city of Colombia, capital of the department of 
Cauca, about 240 m. S.W. of Bogota, on the old trade route 
between that city and Quito, in 2 26' N., 76 49' W. Pop. 
(1870), 8485; (1906, estimate), 10,000. Popayan is built on 
a great plain sloping N.W. from the foot of the volcano Purace, 
near the source of the Cauca and on one of its small tribu- 
taries, 5712 ft. above the sea. Its situation is singularly pic- 
turesque, the Purace rising to an elevation of 15,420 ft. about 
20 m. south-east of the city, the Sotara volcano to approxi- 
mately the same height about the same distance south by 
east, and behind these at a greater distance the Pan de 
Azucar, 15,978 ft. high. The ridge forming the water-parting 
between the basins of the Cauca and Patia rivers crosses 
between the Central and Western Cordilleras at this point 
and culminates a few miles to the south. Popayan is the 
seat of a bishopric dating from 1547, whose cathedral was 
built by the Jesuits; and in the days of its prosperity it 
possessed a university of considerable reputation. It has 
several old churches, a college, two seminaries founded about 
1870 by the French Lazarists, who have restored and occupy 
the old Jesuit convent, and a mint established in 1749. The 
city was at one time an important commercial and mining 
centre, but much of its importance was lost through the transfer 
of trade to Cali and Pasto, through the decay of neighbouring 
mining industries, and through political disturbances. Earth- 
quakes have also caused much damage to Popayan, especially 
those of 1827 and 1834. The modern city has some small 
manufacturing industries, including woollen fabrics for cloth- 
ing, but its trade is much restricted, and its importance is 
political rather than commercial. 

Popayan was founded by Sebastian Benalcazar in 1538 on the 
site of an Indian settlement, whose chief, Payan, had the un- 
usual honour of having his name given to the usurping town. 
In 1558 it received a coat of arms and the title of " Muy noble y 
muy leal " from the king of Spain — a distinction of great

significance in that disturbed period of colonial history. It 
is noted also as the birthplace of Caldas, the Colombian 
naturalist, and of Mosquera, the geographer. There are hot 
sulphurous springs near by on the flanks of the volcano 
Purace, especially at Coconuco, which are much frequented 
by Colombians. 

POPE (Gr. TrdTnras, post-classical Lat. papa, father), an 
ecclesiastical title now used exclusively to designate the head 

of the Roman Catholic Church. In the 4th and 5th 
rMel''" centuries it was frequently used in the West of any 

bishop (Du Cangc, s.v.); but it gradually came to be 
reserved to the bishop of Rome, becoming his official title. 
In the East, on the other hand, only the bishop of Alexandria 
seems to have used it as a title; but as a popular term it 
was applied to priests, and at the present day, in the 
Greek Church and in Russia, all the priests arc called pappas, 
which is also translated "pope." Even in the case of the 
sovereign pontiff the word pope is officially only used as a less 
solemn style: though the ordinary signature and heading of 
briefs is, e.g. " Pius P.P.X.," the signature of bulls is " Pius 
episcopus ecclesiae catholicae" and the heading, " Pius epi- 
scopus, servus servorum Dei" this latter formula going back to 
the time of St Gregory the Great. Other styles met with in 
official documents are Ponlifex, Summits pontifex, Romanus 
pontifex, Sanctissimus, Sanctissimus pater, Sanctissimus domi- 
nus nostcr, Sanctitas sua, Beatissimus pater, Beatitude sua; 
while the pope is addressed in speaking as " Sanctitas vestra," 
or " Beatlssime pater." In the middle ages is also found 
" Dotninus apostolicus " (cf. still, in the litanies of the saints), 
or simply " Apostolicus" 

The pope is pre-eminently, as successor of St Peter, bishop 
of Rome. Writers are fond of viewing him as representing 
various au< tne degrees of the ecclesiastical hierarchy; they 
Degrees say that he is bishop of Rome, metropolitan of the 
° f M Hs ~ Roman province, primate of Italy, patriarch of the 

western Church and head of the universal Church. 
This is strictly correct, but, with the exception of the first 
and last, these titles arc seldom to be found in documents. And 
if these terms were intended to indicate so many degrees in the 
exercise of jurisdiction they would not be correct. As a matter 
of fact, from the earliest centuries (cf. can. 6 of Nicaea, in 325),. 
we see that the popes exercised a special metropolitan juris- 
diction not only over the bishops nearest to Rome, the future 
cardinal bishops, but also over all those of central and southern 
Italy, including Sicily (cf. Duchesne, Origines du culte, ch. 1), 
all of whom received their ordination at his hands. Northern 
Italy and the rest of the western Church, still more the eastern 
Church, did not depend upon him so closely for their administra- 
tion. His influence was exercised, however, not only in 
dogmatic questions but in matters of discipline, by means 
of appeals, petitions and consultations, not to mention spon- 
taneous intervention. This state of affairs was defined and 
developed in the course of centuries, till it produced the present 
state of centralization, according to a law which can equally 
be observed in other societies. In practice the different 
degrees of jurisdiction, as represented in the pope, are of no 
importance: he is bishop of Rome and governs his diocese 
by direct episcopal authority; he is also the head of the 
Church, and in this capacity governs all the dioceses, though the 
regular authority of each bishop in his own diocese is also 
ordinary and immediate, i.e. he is not a mere vicar of the pope. 
But the mode of exercise of a power and its intensity are 
subject to variation, while the power remains essentially the 

Primacy. same - Tn ^ s * s tne case ^ tn tne power of the pope 
and his primacy, the exercise and manifestation of 
which have been continually developing. This primacy, a 
primacy of honour and jurisdiction, involving the plenitude of 
power over the teaching, the worship, the discipline and 
administration of the Church, is received by the pope as 
part of the succession of St Peter, together with the episcopate of 
Rome. The whole episcopal body, with the pope at its head, 
should be considered as succeeding to the apostolic college, 



presided over by St Peter; and the head of it, now as then, as 
personally invested with all the powers enjoyed by the whole 
body, including the head. Hence the pope, as supreme in mat- 
ters of doctrine, possesses the same authority and the same in- 
fallibility as the whole Church; as legislator and judge he pos- 
sesses the same power as the episcopal body gathered around and 
with him in oecumenical council. Such are the two essential 
prerogatives of the papal primacy: infallibility in his supreme 
pronouncements in matters of doctrine (see Infallibility) ; 
and immediate and sovereign jurisdiction, under all its aspects, 
over all the pastors and the faithful. These two privileges, 
having been claimed and enjoyed by the popes in the course 
of centuries, were solemnly defined at the Vatican Council by 
the constitution " Pastor aeternus " of the 18th of July 1870. 
The two principal passages in it are the following. (1) In the 
matter of jurisdiction: " If any one say that the Roman Pontiff 
has an office merely of inspection and direction, and not the 
full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole Church, 
not only in matters of faith and morals, but also as regards 
discipline and the government of the Church scattered through- 
out the whole world; or that he has only the principal portion 
and not the plenitude of that supreme power; or that his power 
is not ordinary and immediate, as much over each and every 
church as over each and every pastor and believer: anathema 
sit." (2) In the matter of infallibility: " We decree that when 
the Roman Pontiff speaks ex cathedra, that is to say, when, in 
his capacity as Pastor and Doctor of all Christians he defines, 
in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, a certain doctrine 
concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church, he 
enjoys, by the divine assistance promised to him in the Blessed 
Peter, that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer has 
thought good to endow His Church in order to define its 
doctrine in matters of faith and morals; consequently, these 
definitions of the Roman Pontiff are irreformable in themselves 
and not in consequence of the consent of the Church." 

For the history of the • papacy, and associated questions, 
see Papacy, Conclave, Curia Romana, Cardinal, &c. 

The ordinary costume of the pope is similar to that of the 
other clergy and bishops, but white in colour; his shoes alone 
are different, being low open shoes, red in colour, with a cross 
embroidered on the front; these are what are called the " mules," 
a substitute for the compagi of ancient" times, formerly reserved 
to the pope and his clergy (cf. Duchesne, op. cit. ch. 11, 6). Over 
this costume the pope wears, on less solemn occasions, the lace 
rochet and the red mozetta, bordered with ermine, or the 
camauro, similar to the mozetta, but with the addition of a hood, 
and over all the stole embroidered with his arms. The pope's 
liturgical costume consists, in the first place, of all the elements 
comprising that of the bishops: stockings and sandals, amice, 
alb, cincture, tunicle and dalmatic, stole, ring, gloves, chasuble 
or cope, the latter, however, with a morse ornamented with 
precious stones, and for head-dress the mitre (see Vestments). 
The tiara (q.v.), the pontifical head-dress, is not used strictly 
speaking in the course of the liturgical functions, but only for 
processions. To these vestments or insignia the pope adds: 
the falda, a kind of long skirt trailing on the ground all round, 
which the chaplains hold up while he is walking. Over the 
chasuble he wears the fanone (see Amice) ; and after that the 
pallium (q.v.). He is preceded by the papal cross, carried with 
the crucifix turned towards him. When going to solemn 
ceremonies he is carried on the sedia, a portable chair of red 
velvet with a high back, and escorted by two flabelli of peacock 
feathers. The papal mass, now rarely celebrated, has preserved 
more faithfully the ancient liturgical usages of the 8th and 9th 
centuries.

POPE, ALEXANDER 



POPE, ALEXANDER (1688-1744), English poet, was born in 
Lombard Street, London, on the 21st of May 1688. His father, 
Alexander Pope, a Roman Catholic, was a linen-draper who 
afterwards retired from business with a small fortune, and fixed 
his residence about 1700 at Binfield in Windsor Forest. Pope's 
education was desultory. His father's religion would have 
excluded him from tbe public schools, even had there been no 
other impediment to his being sent there. Before he was twelve 
he had obtained a smattering of Latin and Greek from various 
masters, from a priest in Hampshire, from a schoolmaster at 
Twyford near Winchester, from Thomas Deane, who kept a 
school in Marylebone and afterwards at Hyde Park Corner, 
and finally from another priest at home. Between his twelfth 
and his seventeenth years excessive application to study under- 
mined his health, and he developed the personal deformity 
which was in so many ways to distort his view of life. He 
thought himself dying, but through a friend, Thomas (after- 
wards the abbe) Southcote, he obtained the advice of the famous 
physician John Radclifle, who prescribed diet and exercise. 
Under this treatment the boy recovered his strength and spirits. 
" He thought himself the better," Spence says, " in some 
respects for not having had a regular education. He (as he 
observed in particular) read originally for the sense, whereas 
we are taught for so many years to read only for words." He 
afterwards learnt French and Italian, probably in a similar 
way. He read translations of the Greek, Latin, French and 
Italian poets, and by the age of twelve, when he was finally 
settled at home and left to himself, he was not only a confirmed 
reader, but an eager aspirant to the highest honours in poetry. 
There is a story, which chronological considerations make 
extremely improbable, that in London he had crept into Will's 
coffee-house to look at Dryden, and a further tale that the old 
poet had given him a shilling for a translation of the story of 
Pyramus and Thisbe; he had lampooned his schoolmaster; he 
had made a play out of John Ogilby's Iliad for his school- 
fellows; and before he was fifteen he had written an epic, his 
hero being Alcander, a prince of Rhodes, or, as he states else- 
where, Deucalion. ^ 

There were, among the Roman Catholic families near Bin- 
field, men capable of giving a direction to his eager ambition, 
men of literary tastes, and connexions with the literary world. 
These held together as • members of persecuted communities 
always do, and were kept in touch with one another by the 
family priests. Pope was thus brought under the notice of Sir 
William Trumbull, a retired diplomatist living at Easthamp- 
stead, within a few miles of Binfield. Thomas Dancastle, lord 
of the manor of Binfield, took an active interest in his writings, 
and at Whiteknights, near Reading, lived another Roman 
Catholic, Anthony Englefield, " a great lover of poets and 
poetry." Through him Pope made the acquaintance of 
Wycherley and of Henry Cromwell, who was a distant cousin of 
the Protector, a gay man about town, and something of a pedant. 
Wycherley introduced him to William Walsh, then of great 
renown as a critic. 1 Before the poet was seventeen he was 
admitted in this way to the society of London " wits " and 
men of fashion, and was cordially encouraged as a prodigy. 
Wycherley's correspondence with Pope was skilfully manipu- 
lated by the younger man to represent Wycherley as sub- 
mitting, at first humbly and then with an ill-grace, to Pope's 
criticisms. The publication (El win and Courthope, vol. v.) 
of the originals of Wycherley's letters from MSS. at Longleat 
showed how seriously the relations between the two friends, 
which ceased in 17 10, had been misrepresented in the version 
of the correspondence which Pope chose to submit to the public. 
Walsh's contribution to his development was the advice to 
study " correctness." " About fifteen," he says, " I got 
acquainted with Mr. Walsh. He used to encourage me much, 
and used to tell me that there was one way left of excelling; 

x The dates of Pope's correspondence with Wycherley are 1704- 
1710; with Walsh, 1705-1707, and with Cromwell, 1 708-1 727; 
with John Caryll (1666-1736) and his son, also neighbours, 1710- 
1735. 



for, though we had several great poets, we never had any one 
great poet that was correct, and he desired me to make that 
my study and aim " (Spence, p. 280). Trumbull turned Pope's 
attention to the French critics, out of the study of whom grew 
the Essay on Criticism; he suggested the subject of Windsor 
Forest, and he started the idea of translating Homer. 

It says something for Pope's docility at this stage that he 
recognized so soon that a long course of preparation was needed 
for such a magnum opus, and began steadily and patiently 
to discipline himself. The epic was put aside and afterwards 
burnt; versification was industriously practised in short 
"essays"; and an elaborate study was made of accepted 
critics and models. He learnt most, as he acknowledged, 
from Dryden, but the harmony of his verse also owed something 
to an earlier writer, George Sandys, the translator of Ovid. 
At the beginning of the r8th century Dryden 's success had given 
great vogue to translations and modernizations. The air was 
full of theories as to the best way of doing such things. What 
Dryden had touched Pope did not presume to meddle with — 
Dryden was his hero and master; but there was much more of 
the same kind to be done. Dryden had rewritten three of the 
Canterbury tales; Pope tried his hand at the Merchant's Tale, 
and the Prologue to the Wife of Bath's Tale, and produced also 
an imitation of the House of Fame. Dryden had translated 
Virgil; Pope experimented on the Thebais of Statius, Ovid's 
Heroides and Metamorphoses, and the Odyssey. He knew little 
Latin and less Greek, but there were older versions in English 
which helped him to the sense; and, when the correspondents 
to whom he submitted his versions pointed out mistranslations, 
he could answer that he had always agreed with them, but 
that he had deferred to the older translators against his own 
judgment. It was one of Pope's little vanities to try to give 
the impression that his metrical skill was more precocious 
even than it was, and we cannot accept his published versions 
of Statius and Chaucer (published in " miscellanies " at intervals 
between 1709 and 1714) as incontrovertible evidence of his pro- 
ficiency at the age of sixteen or seventeen, the date, according to 
his own assertion, of their composition. But it is indisputable 
that at the age of seventeen his skill in verse astonished a 
veteran critic like Walsh, and some of his pastorals were in 
the hands of Sir George Granville (afterwards Lord Lansdowne) 
before 1706. His metrical letter to Cromwell, which El win 
dates in 1707, when Pope was nineteen, is a brilliant feat of 
versification, and has turns of wit in it as easy and spirited as 
any to be found in his mature satires. Pope was twenty-one 
when he sent the " Ode on Solitude "" to Cromwell, and said 
it was written before he was twelve years old. 

Precocious Pope was, but he was also industrious; and he 
spent some eight or nine years in arduous and enthusiastic 
discipline, reading, studying, experimenting, taking the advice 
of some and laughing in his sleeve at the advice of others, 
" poetry his only business," he said, " and idleness his only 
pleasure," before anything of his appeared in print. In these 
preliminary studies he seems to have guided himself by the 
maxim formulated in a letter to Walsh (dated July 2, 1706) 
that " it seems not so much the perfection of sense to say things 
that had never been said before, as to express those best that 
have been said oftenest." His first publication was his 
" Pastorals. " Jacob Tonson, the bookseller, had seen these 
pastorals in the hands of Walsh and Congreve, and sent a 
polite note (April 20, 1706) to Pope asking that he might have 
them for one of his miscellanies. They appeared accordingly 
in May 1709 at the end of the sixth volume of Tonson's 
Poetical Miscellanies, containing contributions from Ambrose 
Philips, Sheffield, Garth and Rowe, with " January and May," 
Pope's version of Chaucer's " Merchant's Tale." 

Pope's next publication was the Essay on Criticism .(1711), 
written two years earlier, and printed without the author's 
name. " In every work regard the writer's end " (1. 255) is one of 
its sensible precepts, and one that is often neglected by critics 
of the essay, who comment upon it as if Pope's end had been 
to produce an original and profound treatise on first principles. 






POPE, ALEXANDER

Mis aim was simply to condense, methodize, and give as perfect 
and novel expression as he could to floating opinions about 
the poet's aims and methods, and the critic's duties, to " what 
oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed " (1. 298). " The 
town " was interested in belles lettres, and given to conversing 
on the subject ; Pope's essay was simply a brilliant contribution 
to the fashionable conversation. The youthful author said 
that he did not expect the sale to be quick because " not one 
gentleman in sixty, even of liberal education,- could understand 
it." The sales were slow until Pope caused copies to be sent 
to Lord Lansdowne and others, but its success was none the 
less brilliant for the delay. The town was fairly dazzled by 
the young poet's learning, judgment, and felicity of expression. 
Many of the admirers of the poem doubtless would have 
thought less of it if they had not believed all the maxims to 
be original. " I admired," said Lady Mary Wort ley Montagu, 
"Mr Pope's Essay on Criticism at first very much, because I 
had not then read any of the ancient critics, and did not know 
that it was all stolen." Pope gained credit for much that might 
have been found, where he found it, in the Institutes of 
Quintilian, in the numerous critical writings of Rene Rapin, 
and in Rene le Bossu's treatise on epic poetry. Addison has 
been made responsible for the exaggerated value once set on 
the essay, but Addison's paper (Spectator, No. 253) was not 
unmixed praise. He deprecated the attacks made by Pope 
on contemporary literary reputations, although he did full 
justice to the poet's metrical skill. Addison and Pope became 
acquainted with one another, and Pope's sacred eclogue, 
" Messiah," was printed as No. 378 of the Spectator. In the 
Essay on Criticism Pope provoked one bitter personal enemy 
in John Dennis, the critic, by a description of him as Appius, 
who " stares, tremendous, with a threat'ning eye." Dennis 
retorted in Reflections . . upon a late Rhapsody . . (1711), abusing 
Pope among other things for his personal deformity. Pope 
never forgot this brutal attack, which he described in a note 
inserted after Dennis's death, as late as 1743, as written " in 
a manner perfectly lunatic." 

The Rope of the Lock in its first form appeared in 171 2 in 
Lintot' s Miscellanies ■; the " machinery "of sylphs and gnomes 
was an afterthought, and the poem was republished as we now 
have it early in 1714. William, 4th Baron Petre, had surrep- 
titiously cut off a lock of Miss Arabella Fermor's hair, and the 
liberty had been resented; Pope heard the story from his friend 
John Caryll, who suggested that the breach between the 
families might be healed by making the incident the subject 
of a mock-heroic poem like Boileau's Littrin. Pope caught at 
the hint; the mock-heroic treatment of the pretty frivolities of 
fashionable life just suited his freakish sprightliness of wit, and 
his studies of the grand epic at the time put him in excellent 
vein. The Rape of the Lock is admitted to be a masterpiece of 
airiness, ingenuity, and exquisite finish. But the poem struck 
Taine as a piece of harsh, scornful, indelicate buffoonery, a mere 
succession of oddities and contrasts, of expressive figures un- 
expected and grinning, an example of English insensibility 
to ^ French sweetness and refinement. Sir Leslie Stephen 
objected on somewhat different grounds to the poet's tone 
towards women. His laughter at Pope's raillery was checked 
by the fact that women are spoken of in the poem as if they 
were all like Belinda. The poem shows the hand of the 
satirist who was later to assert that " every woman is at 
heart a rake," in the epistle addressed to Martha Blount. 

Windsor Forest, modelled on Sir John Denham's Cooper's Hill, 
had been begun, according to Pope's account, when he was 
sixteen or seventeen. It was published in March 1713 with a 
flattering dedication to the secretary for war, George Granville, 
Lord Lansdowne, and an opportune allusion to the peace of 
Utrecht. This was a nearer approach to taking a political side 
than Pope had yet made. His principle had been to keep clear of 
politics, and not to attach himself to any of the sets into which 
literary men were divided by party. Although inclined to the 
Jacobites by his religion, he never took any part in the plots for 
the restoration of the Stuarts, and he was on friendly terms with 



the Whig coterie, being a frequent guest at the coffee-house 
kept by Daniel Button, where Addison held his " little senate." 
He had contributed his poem, " The Messiah " to the Spectator; 
he had written an article or two in the Guardian, and he wrote 
a prologue for Addison's Cato. Nevertheless he induced 
Lintot the bookseller to obtain from John Dennis a criti- 
cism of Cato. On the publication of Dennis's remarks, the 
violence of which had, as Pope hoped, made their author ridicu- 
lous, Pope produced an anonymous pamphlet, The Narrative 
of Dr Robert Norris concerning the . . . Frenzy * of Mr 
John Dennis (1713)1 which, though nominally in defence of 
Addison, had for its main purpose the -gratification of Pope's 
own hostility to Dennis. Addison disavowed any connivance 
in this coarse attack in a letter written on his behalf by Steele 
to Lintot, saying that if he noticed Dennis's attack at all it 
would be in such a way as to allow him no just cause of 
complaint. Coolness between Addison and Pope naturally 
followed this episode. When the Rape of the Lock was 
published, Addison, who is said to have praised the poem 
highly to Pope in private, dismissed it in the Spectator with two 
sentences of patronizing faint praise to the young poet, and, 
coupling it with Tickell's " Ode on the Prospect of Peace," 
devoted the rest of the article to an elaborate puff of " the 
pastorals of Mr Philips." 

When Pope showed a leaning to the" Tories in Windsor Forest, 
the members of Addison's coterie made insidious war on him. 
Witbin a few weeks of the publication of the poem, and when it 
was the talk of the town, there began to appear in the Guardian 
(Nos. 22, 23, 28, 30, 32) a series of articles on " Pastorals." Not 
a word was said about Windsor Forest, but everybody knew 
to what the general principles referred. Modern pastoral 
poets were ridiculed for introducing Greek moral deities, Greek 
flowers and fruits, Greek names of shepherds, Greek sports and 
customs and religious rites. They ought to make use of English 
rural mythology — hobthrushes, fairies, goblins and witches; 
they should give English names to their shepherds; they should 
mention flowers indigenous to English climate and soil; and 
they should introduce English proverbial sayings, dress, 
and customs. All excellent principles, and all neglected by 
Pope in Windsor Forest. The poem was fairly open to criticism 
in these points; there are many beautiful passages in it, show- 
ing close though somewhat professional observation of nature, 
but the mixture of heathen deities and conventional archaic 
fancies with modern realities is incongruous, and the com- 
parison of Queen Anne to Diana was ludicrous. But the 
sting of the articles did not lie in the truth of the oblique 
criticisms. The pastorals of Ambrose Philips, published four 
years before, were again trotted out. Here was a true pastoral 
poet, the eldest born of Spenser, the worthy successor of 
Theocritus and Virgil! 

Pope took an amusing revenge, which turned the laugh 
against his assailants. He sent Steele an anonymous paper 
in continuation of the articles in the Guardian on pastoral 
poetry, reviewing the poems of Mr Pope by the light of the 
principles laid down. Ostensibly Pope was censured for 
breaking the rules, and Philips praised for conforming to them, 
quotations being given from both. The quotations were 
sufficient to dispose of the pretensions of poor Philips, and Pope 
did not choose his own worst passages, accusing himself of 
actually deviating sometimes into poetry. Although the 
Guardian's principles were also brought into ridicule by bur- 
lesque exemplifications of them after the manner of Gay's 
Shepherd's Week, Steele, misled by the opening sentences, was 
at first unwilling to print what appeared to be a direct attack 
on Pope, and is said to have asked Pope's consent to the 
publication, which was graciously granted. 

The links that attached Pope to the Tory party were strength- 
ened by a new friendship. His first letter to Swift, who 
became warmly attached to him, is dated the 8th of December 
1 713. Swift had been a leading member of the Brothers* 
Club, from which the famous Scriblerus Club seems to have 
been an offshoot. The leading members of this informal 



84 



POPE, ALEXANDER 



literary society were Swift, Arbuthnot, Congreve, Bishop 
Atterbury, Pope, Gay and Thomas Parnell. Their chief object 
was a general war against the dunces, waged with great spirit 
by Arbuthnot, Swift and Pope. 

The estrangement from Addison was completed in' connexion 
with 'Pope's translation of Homer. This enterprise was 
definitely undertaken in 1713. The work was to be published 
by subscription, as Dryden's Virgil had been. Men of all 
parties subscribed, their unanimity being a striking proof of 
the position Pope had attained at the age of twenty-five. It 
was as if he had received a national commission as by general 
consent the first poet of his time. But the unanimity was 
broken by a discordant note. A member of the Addison clique, 
Tickell, attempted to run a rival version. Pope suspected 
Addison's instigation; Tickell had at least Addison's encourage- 
ment. Pope's famous character of Addison as " Atticus " in 
the Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot (ii. 193-215) was, however, in- 
spired by resentment at insults that existed chiefly in his own 
imagination, though Addison was certainly not among his 
warmest admirers. Pope afterwards claimed to have been 
magnanimous, but he spoiled his case by the petty inventions 
of his account of the quarrel. 

The translation of Homer was Pope's chief employment for 
twelve years. The new pieces in the miscellanies published in 
1717, his "Elegy on an Unfortunate Lady," and his " Eloisa 
to Abelard," were probably written some years before their 
publication. His " Eloisa to Abelard " was based on an 
English translation by John Hughes of a French version of the 
Letters, which differed very considerably from the original 
Latin. The Iliad was delivered to the subscribers in instal- 
ments in 1715, 1717, 1718 and 1720. Pope's own defective 
scholarship made help necessary. William Broome and John 
Jortin supplied the bulk of the notes, and Thomas Parnell the 
preface. For the translation of the Odyssey he took Elijah 
Fenton and Broome as coadjutors, who between them trans- 
lated twelve out of the twenty-four books. 1 It was completed 
in 1725. The profitableness of [the work was Pope's chief 
temptation to undertake it. His receipts for his earlier poems 
had totalled about £150, but he cleared more than £8000 by the 
two translations, after deducting all payments to coadjutors — 
a much larger sum than had ever been received by an English 
author before. 

The translation of Homer had established Pope's reputation 
with his contemporaries, and has en4angered it ever since it 
was challenged. Opinions have varied on the purely literary 
merits of the poem, but with regard to it as a translation few 
have differed from Bentley's criticism, " A fine poem, Mr Pope, 
but you must not call it Homer." His collaboration with 
Broome (q.v.) and Fenton (q.v.) 2 involved him in a series of 
recriminations. Broome was weak enough to sign a note at 
the end of the work understating the extent of Fenton's assist- 
ance as well as his own, and ascribing the merit of their trans- 
lation, reduced to less than half its real proportions, to a 
regular revision and correction — mostly imaginary — at Pope's 
hands. These falsehoods were deemed necessary by Pope to 
protect himself against possible protests from the subscribers. 
In 1722 he edited the poems of Thomas Parnell, and in 1725 
made a considerable sum by an unsatisfactory edition of Shake- 
speare, in which he had the assistance of Fenton and Gay. 

Pope, with his economical habits, was rendered independent 
by the pecuniary success of his Homer, and enabled to live near 
London. The estate at Binfield was sold, and he removed 
with his parents to Mawson's Buildings, Chiswick, in 1716, and 
in 17 19 to Twickenham, to the house with which his name is 
associated. Here he practised elaborate landscape gardening 
on a small scale, and built his famous grotto, which was really 
a tunnel under the road connecting the garden with the lawn 
on the Thames. He was constantly visited at Twickenham 
by his intimates, Dr John Arbuthnot, John Gay, Bolingbroke

(after his return in 1723), and Swift (during his brief visits to 
England in 1726 and 1727), and by many other friends of the 
Tory party. With Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, he was on 
terms of affectionate intimacy, but he blundered in his evidence 
when he was called as a witness on his behalf in 1723. 

In 1717 his father died, and he appears to have turned to the 
Blounts for sympathy in what was to him a very serious 
bereavement. He had early made the acquaintance of Martha 
and Teresa Blount, both of them intimately connected with 
his domestic history. Their home was at Mapledurham,. near 
Reading, but Pope probably first met them at the house of 
his neighbour, Mr Englefield of Whiteknights, who w T as their 
grandfather. He begun to correspond with Martha Blount 
in 1712, and after 17 17 the letters are much more serious 
in tone. He quarrelled with Teresa, who had apparently 
injured or prevented his suit to her sister; and although, after 
her father's death in 1718, he paid her an annuity, he seems 
to have regarded her as one of his most dangerous enemies. 
His friendship with Martha lasted all his life. So long as his 
mother lived he was unwearying in his attendance on her, but 
after her death in 1733 his association with Martha Blount was 
more constant. In defiance of the scandal-mongers, they 
paid visits together at the houses of common friends, and at 
Twickenham she spent part of each day with him. His earlier 
attachment to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was apparently a 
more or less literary passion, which perished under Lady Mary's 
ridicule. 

The year 1725 may be taken as" the beginning of the third 
period of Pope's career, when he made his fame as a moralist 
and a satirist. It may be doubted whether Pope had the stay- 
ing power necessary for the composition of a great imaginative 
work, whether his crazy constitution would have held together 
through the strain. He toyed with the idea of writing a grand 
epic. He told Spence that he had it all in his head, and gave him 
a vague (and it must be admitted not very promising) sketch 
of the subject and plan of it. But he never put any of it on 
paper. He shrank as with instinctive repulsion from the stress 
and strain of complicated designs. Even his prolonged task 
of translating weighed heavily on his spirits, and this was a much 
less formidable effort than creating an epic. He turned rather 
to designs that could be accomplished in detail, works of which 
the parts could be separately laboured at and put together with 
patient care, into which happy thoughts could be fitted that 
had been struck out at odd moments and in ordinary levels of 
feeling. 

Edward Young's satire, The Universal Passion, had just 
appeared, and been received with more enthusiasm than any 
thing published since Pope's own early successes. This alone 
would have been powerful inducement to Pope's emulous tem- 
per. Swift was finishing Gulliver's Travels, and came over to 
England in 1726. The survivors of the Scriblerus Gut) — Swift, 
Pope, Arbuthnot, and Gay — resumed their old amusement of 
parodying and otherwise ridiculing bad writers, especially bad 
writers in the Whig interest. Two volumes of their Mis- 
cellanies in Prose and Verse were published in 1727. A third 
volume appeared in 1728, and a fourth was added in 1732. 
According to Pope's own history of the Dunciad, an Heroic 
Poem in Three Books, which first appeared on the 28th of May 
1728, the idea of it grew out of'this. Among the Miscellanies 
was a " Treatise of the Bathos or the Art of Sinking in Poetry," 
in which poets were classified, with illustrations, according to 
their eminence in the various arts of debasing instead of elevating 
their subject. No names were mentioned, but the specimens 
of bathos were assigned to various letters of the alphabet, which, 
the authors boldly asserted, were taken at random. But no 
sooner was the treatise published than the scribblers proceeded 
to take the letters to themselves, and in revenge to fill the news- 
papers with the most abusive falsehoods and scurrilities they 
could devise. This gave Pope the opportunity he had hoped 
for, and provided him with an excuse for the personalities 
of the Dunciad, which had been in his mind as early as 1720. 
Among the most prominent objects of his satire were Lewis 



POPE, ALEXANDER 



85 



Theobald, Colley Cibber, John Dennis, Richard Bcntley, Aaron 
Hill and Bernard Lintot, who, in spite of his former relations 
with Pope, was now classed with the piratical Edmund Curll. 
The book was published with the greatest precautions. It was 
anonymous, and professed to be a reprint of a Dublin edition. 
When the success of the poem was assured, it was republished 
in 1729, and a copy was presented to the king by Sir Robert 
Walpole. Names took the place of initials, and a defence 
of the satire, written by Pope himself, but signed by his friend 
William Cleland, was printed as " A letter to the Publisher." 
Various indexes, notes and particulars of the attacks on Pope 
made by the different authors satirized were added. To avoid 
any danger of prosecution, the copyright was assigned to Lord 
Oxford, Lord Bathurst and Lord Burlington, whose position 
rendered them practically unassailable. We may admit that 
personal spite influenced Pope at least as much as disinte- 
rested zeal for the honour of literature, but in the dispute as to 
the comparative strength of these motives, a third is apt to be 
overlooked that was probably stronger than either. This was 
an unscrupulous elfish love of fun, and delight in the creations 
of a humorous imagination. Certainly to represent the Dun- 
ciad as the outcome of mere personal spite is to give an exag- 
gerated idea of the malignity of Pope's disposition, and an 
utterly wrong impression of the character of his satire. He was 
not, except in rare cases, a morose, savage, indignant satirist, 
but airy and graceful in his malice, revengeful perhaps and 
excessively sensitive, but restored to good humour as he thought 
over his wrongs by the ludicrous conceptions with which he 
invested his adversaries. The most unprovoked assault was 
on Richard Bentley, whom he satirized in the reconstruction 
and enlargement of the Dunciad made in the last years of his 
life at the instigation, it is said, of William Warburton. In 
the earlier editions the place of hero had been occupied by 
Lewis Theobald, who had ventured to criticize Pope's Shake- 
speare. In the edition which appeared in Pope's Works (1742), 
he was dethroned in favour of Colley Cibber, who had just 
written his Letter from Mr Cibber to Mr Pope inquiring into 
the motives that might induce him in his satyr teal writings to be 
so frequently fond of Mr Cibber y s name (1742). Warburton's 
name is attached to many new notes, and one of the preliminary 
dissertations by Ricardus Aristarchus on the hero of the poem 
seems to be by him. 

The four epistles of the Essay on Man (1733) were also 
intimately connected with passing controversies. They belong 
to the same intellectual movement with Butler's Analogy — the 
effort of the 18th century to put religion on a rational basis. 
But Pope was not a thinker like Butler. The subject was 
suggested to him by Henry St John, Lord Bolingbroke, who 
had returned from exile in 1723, and was a fellow-member of 
the Scriblerus Club. Bolingbroke is said — and the statement 
is supported by the contents of his posthumous works — to 
have furnished most of the arguments. Pope's contribution 
to the controversy consisted in brilliant epigram and illustra- 
tion. In this didactic work, as in his Essay on Criticism, he 
put together on a sufficiently simple plan a scries of happy 
sayings, separately elaborated, picking up the thoughts as he 
found them in miscellaneous reading and conversation, and 
trying only to fit them with perfect expression. His readers 
were too dazzled by the verse to be severely critical of the sense. 
Pope himself had not comprehended the drift of the arguments 
he had adopted from Bolingbroke, and was alarmed when he 
found that his poem was generally interpreted as an apology 
for the free-thinkers. Warburton is said to have qualified 
its doctrines as " rank atheism, " and asserted that it was put 
together from the " worst passages of the worst authors." The 
essay was soon translated into the chief European languages, 
and in 1737 its orthodoxy was assailed by a Swiss professor, 
Jean Pierre dc Crousaz, in an Examen de V essay de M. Pope 
sur Vhomme. Warburton now saw fit to revise his opinion 
of Pope's abilities and principles — for what reason does not 
appear. In any case he now became as enthusiastic in his 
praise of Pope's orthodoxy and his genius as he had before been 



scornful, and proceeded to employ his unrivalled powers of 
sophistry in a defence of the orthodoxy of the conflicting and 
inconsequent positions adopted in the Essay on Man. Pope 
was wise enough to accept with all gratitude an ally who was 
so useful a friend and so dangerous an enemy, and from that 
time onward Warburton was the authorized commentator of 
his works. 

The Essay on Man was to have formed part of a series of 
philosophic poems on a systematic plan. The other pieces 
were to treat of human reason, of the use of learning, wit, 
education and riches, of civil and ecclesiastical polity, of the 
character of women, &c. Of the ten epistles of the Moral 
Essays t the first four, written between 1731 and 1735, arc 
connected with this scheme, which was never executed. 

There was much bitter, and sometimes unjust, satire in the 
Moral Essays and the Imitations of Horace. In these epistles 
and satires, which appeared at intervals, he was often the mouth- 
piece of his political friends, who were all of them in opposition 
to Walpole, then at the height of his power, and Pope chose 
the object of his attacks from among the minister's adherents. 
Epistle III., " Of the Use of Riches," addressed to Allen Bath- 
urst, Lord Bathurst, in 1732, is a direct attack on Wal pole's 
methods of corruption, and on his financial policy in general; 
and the two dialogues (1738) known as the " Epilogue to the 
Satires," professedly a defence of satire, form an eloquent 
attack on the court. Pope was attached to the prince of Wales's 
party, and he did not forget to insinuate, what was indeed the 
truth, that the queen had refused the prince her pardon on 
her deathbed. The " Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot " contains a de- 
scription of his personal attitude towards the scribblers and is 
made to serve as a " prologue to the satires." The gross and 
unpardonable insults bestowed on Lord Hervey and on Lady 
Mary Wortley Montagu in the first satire " to Mr Fortescue " 
provoked angry retaliation from both. The description of 
Timon's ostentatious villa in Epistle IV., addressed to the earl 
of Burlington, was generally taken as a picture of Canons, the 
seat of John Brydges, duke of Chandos, one of Pope's patrons, 
and caused a great outcry, though in this case Pope seems to 
have been innocent of express allusion. Epistle II., addressed 
to Martha Blount, contained the picture of Atossa, which 
was taken to be a portrait of Sarah Jennings, duchess of 
Marlborough. One of the worst imputations on Pope's character 
was that he left this passage to be published when he had in 
effect received a bribe of £1000 from the duchess of Marl- 
borough for its suppression through the agency of Nathanael 
Hooke (d. 1763). As the passage eventually stood, it might 
be applied to Katherine, duchess of Buckingham, a natural 
daughter of James II. Pope may have altered it with the 
intention of diverting the satire from the original object. 
He was scrupulously honest in money matters, and alw T ays in- 
dependent in matters of patronage; but there is some evidence 
for this discreditable story beyond the gossip of Horace Wal- 
pole {Works, ed. P. Cunningham, i. cxliv.), though not suffi- 
cient to justify the acceptance it received by some of Pope's 
biographers. To appreciate fully the point of his. allusions 
requires an intimate acquaintance with the political and social 
gossip of the time. But apart from their value as a brilliant 
strongly-coloured picture of the time Pope's satires have a 
permanent value as literature. It is justly remarked by Mark 
Pattison 1 that "these Imitations are among the most original 
of his writings." The vigour and terseness of the diction is 
still unsurpassed in English verse. Pope had gained complete 
mastery over his medium, the heroic couplet, before he used 
it to express his hatred of the political and social evils which 
he satirized. The elaborate periphrases and superfluous orna- 
ments of his earlier manner, as exemplified in the Pastorals and 
the Homer, disappeared; he turned to the uses of verse the 
ordinary language of conversation, differing from everyday 
speech only in its exceptional brilliance and point. It is in 
these satires that his best work must be sought, and by them 
that his position among English poets must be fixed. It was

the Homer chiefly that Wordsworth and Coleridge had in their 
eye when they began the polemic against the " poetic diction " 
of the 1 8th century, and struck at Pope as the arch-corrupter. 
They were historically unjust to Pope, who did not originate 
this diction, but only furnished the most finished examples 
of it. At the beginning of the 19th century Pope still had 
an ardent admirer in Byron, whose first satires are written in 
Pope's couplet. The much abused pseudo-poetic diction in 
substance consisted in an ambition to " rise above the vulgar 
style," to dress nature to advantage — a natural ambition when 
the arbiters of literature were people of fashion. If one com- 
pares Pope's " Messiah " or " Eloisa to Abelard," or an im- 
passioned passage from the Iliad, with the originals that he 
paraphrased, one gets a more vivid idea of the consistence of 
pseudo-poetic diction than could be furnished by pages of an- 
alysis. But Pope merely made masterly use of the established 
diction of his time, which he eventually forsook for a far more 
direct and vigorous style. A passage from the Guardian, in 
which Philips was commended as against him, runs: " It is 
a nice piece of art to raise a proverb above the vulgar style 
and still keep it easy and unaffected. Thus the old wish, ' God 
rest his soul,' is very finely turned: — 

" ' Then gentle Sidney liv'd, the shepherd's friend, 
Eternal blessings on his shade attend 1 ' " 

Pope would have despised so easy a metamorphosis as this 
at any period in his career, and the work of his coadjutors in 
the Odyssey may be distinguished by this comparative cheapness 
of material. Broome's description of the clothes-washing by 
Nausicaa and her maidens in the sixth book may be compared 
with the original as a luminous specimen. 

Pope's wit had won for him the friendship of many distin- 
guished men, and his small fortune enabled him to meet them 
on a footing of independence. He paid long visits at many 
great houses, especially at Stanton Harcourt, the home of his 
friend Lord Chancellor Harcourt; at Oakley, the seat of Lord 
Batburst; and at Prior Park, Bath, where his host was Ralph 
Allen. With the last named he had a temporary disagree- 
ment owing to some slight shown to Martha Blount, but he 
was reconciled to him before his death. 

He died on the 30th of May 1744, and he was buried in the 
parish church of Twickenham. He left the income from his 
property to Martha Blount till her death, after which it was to 
go to his half-sister Magdalen Rackett and her children. His 
unpublished MSS. were left at the discretion of Lord Boling- 
broke, and his copyrights to Warburton. 

If we are to judge Pope, whether as a man or as a poet, with 
human fairness, and not merely by comparison with standards 
of abstract perfection, there are two features of his times that 
must be kept steadily in view — the character of political strife 
in those days and the political relations of men of letters. As 
long as the succession to the Crown was doubtful, and political 
failure might mean loss of property, banishment or death, 
politicians, playing for higher stakes, played more fiercely and 
unscrupulously than in modern days, and there was no con- 
trolling force of public opinion to keep them within the bounds 
of common honesty. Hence the age of Queen Anne is pre- 
eminently an age of intrigue. The government was almost as 
unsettled as in the early days of personal monarchy, and there 
was this difference — that it was policy rather than force upon 
which men depended for keeping their position. Secondly, 
men of letters were admitted to the inner circles of intrigue as 
they had never been before and as they have never been since. A 
generation later Walpole defied them, and paid the rougher 
instruments that he considered sufficient for his purpose in 
solid coin of the realm; but Queen Anne's statesmen, whether 
from difference of tastes or difference of policy, paid their prin- 
cipal literary champions with social privileges and honourable 
public appointments. Hence men of letters were directly in- 
fected by the low political morality of the unsettled time. And 
the character of their poetry also suffered. The most promi- 
nent defects of the age — the lack of high and sustained 
imagination, the genteel liking for " nature to advantage 



dressed," the incessant striving after wit — were fostered, 
not generated, by the social atmosphere. 

Pope's own ruling passion was the love of fame, and be had 
no scruples where this was concerned. His vanity and his 
childish love of intrigue are seen at their worst in his petty 
manoeuvres to secure the publication of his letters during his 
lifetime. These intricate proceedings were unravelled with 
great patience and ingenuity by Charles Wentworth Dilke, 
when the false picture of his relations with his contemporaries 
which Pope had imposed on the public had been practically 
accepted for a century. Elizabeth Thomas, the mistress of 
Henry Cromwell, had sold Pope's early letters to Henry 
Cromwell to the bookseller Curll for ten guineas. These 
were published in Curll's Miscellanea in 1726 (dated 1727), and 
had considerable success. This surreptitious publication seems 
to have suggested to Pope the desirability of publishing his own 
correspondence, which he immediately began, to collect from 
various friends on the plea of preventing a similar clandestine 
transaction. The publication by Wycherley's executors of a 
posthumous volume of the dramatist's prose and verse fur- 
nished Pope with an excuse for the appearance of bis own 
correspondence with Wycherley, which was accompanied by a 
series of unnecessary deceptions. After manipulating his cor- 
respondence so as to place his own character in the best light, 
he deposited a copy in the library of Edward, second earl of 
Oxford, and then he bad it printed. The sheets were offered 
to Curll by a person calling himself P.T., who professed a desire 
to injure Pope, but was no other than Pope himself. The copy 
was delivered to Curll in 1735 after long negotiations by an 
agent who called himself R. Smythe, with a few originals to 
vouch for their authenticity. P. T. had drawn up an adver- 
tisement stating that the book was to contain answers from 
various peers. Curll was summoned before the House of Lords 
for breach of privilege, but was acquitted, as the letters from 
peers were not in fact forthcoming. Difficulties then arose 
between Curll and P. T., and Pope induced a bookseller named 
Cooper to publish a Narrative of the Method by which Mr 
Pope's Private Letters were procured by Edmund Curll, Book- 
seller (1735). These preliminaries cleared the way for a show 
of indignation against piratical publishers and a " genuine " 
edition of the Letters of Mr Alexander Pope (1737, fol. and 
4to). Unhappily for Pope's reputation, his friend Caryll, who 
died before the publication, had taken a copy of Pope's letters 
before returning them. This letter-book came to light in the 
middle of the 19th century, and showed the freedom which 
Pope permitted himself in editing. The correspondence with 
Lord Oxford, preserved at Longleat, afforded further evidence 
of his tortuous dealings. The methods he employed to secure 
his correspondence with Swift were even more discreditable. 
The proceedings can only be explained as the measures of a 
desperate man whose maladies seem to have engendered a 
passion for trickery. They are related in detail by Elwin in 
the introduction to vol. i. of Pope's Works. A man who is said 
to have " played the politician about cabbages and turnips," 
and who " hardly drank tea without a stratagem," was not 
likely to be straightforward in a matter in which his ruling 
passion was concerned. Against Pope's petulance and " general 
love of secrecy' and cunning " have to be set, in any fair judg- 
ment of his character, his exemplary conduct as a son, the 
affection with which he was regarded in his own circle of 
intimates, and many well-authenticated instances of genuine 
and continued kindliness to persons in distress. 

Bibliography.— Various collected editions of ^ Pope's Works 
appeared during his lifetime, and in 1751 an edition in nine volumes 
was published by a syndicate of booksellers " with the commentaries 
of Mr Warburton." Warburton interpreted his editorial rights very 
liberally. By his notes he wilfully misrepresented the meaning of 
the allusions in the satires, and made them more agreeable to his 
friends and to the court, while he made opportunities for the gratifi- 
cation of his own spite against various individuals. Joseph Warton's 
edition in 179^ added to the mass of commentary without giving 
much new elucidation to the allusions of the text, which even Swilt, 
with his exceptional facilities, had found obscure. In 1769-1807 an 
edition was issued which included Owen Ruffhead's Life of Atexander

Pope (1769), inspired by Warburton. The notes of many^ com- 
mentators, with some letters and a memoir, were included in the 
Works of Alexander Pope, edited by W. L. Bowles (10 vols., 1806). 
His Poetical Works were edited by Alexander Dvce (1856); by R. 
Carruthers (1858) for Bonn's Library; by A. W. Ward (Globe Edition, 
1869), &c. Materials for a definitive edition were collected by John 
Wilson Croker, and formed the basis of what has become the standard 
version, The Works of Alexander Pope (10 vols., 1871-1898), including 
unpublished letters and other new material, with introduction and 
notes by W.' Elwin and W. J. Courthope. The life of Pope in 
vol. v. was contributed by Professor Courthope. The chief original 
authority besides Pope s correspondence and Rufifhead's Life is 
Joseph Spence's Anecdotes, published by S. W. Singer in 1820. 
Samuel Johnson gives a good estimate of Pope in his Lives of the 
Poets. The best modern lives are that by Professor Courthope, 
already mentioned; and Alexander Pope, by Sir L. Stephen, in the 
English Men of Letters series (1880). See also George Paston, Mr 
Pope: His Life and Times (1900). The first check to the admiration 
that prevailed during Pope's lifetime was given by the publication of 
Joseph Warton's Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope (vol. i ; , 
1757; vol. ii., 1782). Warton had a sincere appreciation of Pope's 
work, but he began the reaction which culminated with the 
romantic writers of the beginning of the 19th century, and set the 
fashion of an undue disparagement of Pope's genius as a poet with 
enduring effects on popular opinion. Thomas Campbell's criticism 
rn his Specimens of the British Poets provoked a controversy to which 
William Hazlitt, Byron and W. L. Bowles contributed. For a 
discussion of Pope's position as one of the great men of letters in the 
1 8th century who emancipated themselves from patronage, see 
A. Beljame, Le Public et Us hotnmes de lettres en An^leterre au dix- 
huitieme sibcle (1881); a section of Isaac D ( ' Israeli's Quarrels of 
Authors is devoted to Pope's literary animosities; and most impor- 
tant contributions to many vexed questions in the biography of 
Pope, especially the publication of his letters, were made by C. W. 
Dilke in Notes and Queries and the Athenaeum, t These articles 
were reprinted by his grandson, Sir Charles Dilke, in 1875, as The 
Papers of a Critic. (W. M.; M. Br.) 

POPE, ALEXANDER (1763-1835), Irish actor and painter, 
was born in Cork, and was educated to follow his father's 
profession of miniature painting. He continued to paint 
miniatures and exhibit them at the Royal Academy as late as 
1821; but at an early date he took the stage, first appearing 
in London as Oroonoko in 1785 at Covent Garden. He remained 
at this theatre almost continuously for nearly twenty years, 
then at the Haymarket until his retirement, playing leading 
parts, chiefly tragic. He was particularly esteemed as Othello 
and Henry VIII. He died on the 22nd of March 1&35. Pope 
was thrice married. His first wife, Elizabeth Pope (c. 1744- 
1797), a favourite English actress of great versatility, was billed 
before her marriage as Miss Younge. His second wife, M aria Ann 
Pope (1 775-1803), also a popular actress, was a member of an 
Irish family named Campion. His third wife, Clara Maria Pope 
(d. 1838), was the widow of the artist Francis Wheatley, and 
herself a skilful painter of figures and of flowers. 

POPE, JANE (174 2-1 8 1 8), English actress, daughter of a 
London theatrical wig-maker, who began playing hi a Lilli- 
putian company for Garrick in 1756. From this she speedily 
developed into soubrette roles. She was Mrs Candour in The 
School for Scandal at its first presentation (1777)* and thereafter 
she had many important parts confided to her. She was the 
life-long friend of Mrs Clive, and erected the monument at 
Twickenham to the latter's memory. She was not only an 
admirable actress, but a woman of blameless life, and was 
praised by all the literary critics of her day — unused to such a 
combination. She died on the 30th of July 1818. 

POPE, JOHN (1822-1892), American soldier, was the son of 
Nathaniel Pope (1784-1850), U.S. judge for the district of 
Illinois, and was born at Louisville, Kentucky, on the 16th of 
March 1822. He graduated at the United States Military 
Academy in 1842 and was assigned to the engineers. He served 
in the Mexican War, receiving the brevets of 1st lieutenant and 
captain for his conduct at Monterey and Buena Vista. Sub- 
sequently he was engaged in engineering and exploring work, 
mainly in New Mexico, and in surveying the route for a Pacific 
railroad. He was commissioned captain in 1856. He was 
actively opposed to the Buchanan administration, and a speech 
which he made in connexion with the presidential campaign 
of i860 caused him to be summoned before a court-martial. 
Early in the Civil War he was placed, as a brigadier-general 



U.S. V., in charge of the district of Missouri, which by vigorous 
campaigning against guerrilla bands and severe administration of 
the civil population he quickly reduced to order. In 1862, along 
with the gunboat flotilla (commanded by Commodore A. H. 
Foote) on the Mississippi, Pope obtained a great success by the 
capture of the defences of New Madrid and Island No. ro, with 
nearly 7000 prisoners. Pope subsequently joined Halleck, and in 
command of the Army of the Mississippi took part in the siege of 
Corinth. He was now a major-general U.S.V. The repu- 
tation he had thus gained as an energetic leader quickly 
placed him in a high command, to which he proved to be quite 
unequal. The u Army of Virginia," as* his new forces were 
styled, had but a brief career. At the very outset of his Virginian 
campaign Pope, by a most ill-advised order, in which he con- 
trasted the performances of the Western troops with the failuies 
of the troops in Virginia, forfeited the confidence of his officers 
and men. The feeling of the Army of the Potomac (which was 
ordered to his support) was equally hostile, and the short opera- 
tions culminated in the disastrous defeat of the second battle of 
Bull Run. Pope was still sanguine and ready for another trial of 
strength, but he was soon compelled to realize the impossibility 
of retrieving his position, and resigned the command. Bitter 
controversy arose over these events. Halleck, the general-in- 
chief, was by no means free from blame, but the public odium 
chiefly fell upon generals McClellan and Fitz-John Porter, against 
whom Pope, while admitting his own mistakes, made grave 
charges. Pope was not again employed in the Civil War, but in 
command of the Department of the North- West he showed his 
former skill and vigour in dealing with Indian risings. In 1865 
he was made brevet major-general U.S.A. (having become 
brigadier-general on his appointment to the Army of Virginia), 
and he subsequently was in charge of various military districts 
and departments until his retirement in 1886. In 1882 he was 
promoted to the full rank of major-general U.S.A. General 
Pope died at Sandusky, Ohio, on the 23rd of September 1892. 

He was the author of various works and papers, including railway 
reports {Pacific Railroad Reports vol. iii.) and The Campaign of 
Virginia (Washington, 1865). 

POPE, SIR THOMAS (c. 1 507-1 559), founder of Trinity College, 
Oxford, was born at Deddington, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, 
probably in 1507, for he was about sixteen years old when his 
father, a yeoman farmer, died in 1523. He was educated at 
Banbury school and Eton College, and entered the court of 
chancery. He there found a friend and patron in the lord- 
chancellor Thomas Audley. As clerk of briefs in the star 
chamber, warden of the mint (1 534-1536), clerk of the Crown in 
chancery (1537), and second officer and treasurer of the court 
for the settlement of the confiscated property of the smaller 
religious foundations, he obtained wealth and influence. In this 
last office he was superseded in 1541, but from 1547 to 1553 he 
was again employed as fourth officer. He himself won by grant 
or purchase a considerable share in the spoils, for nearly thirty 
manors, which came sooner or later into his possession, were 
originally church property. " He could have rode," said Aubrey, 
" in his owne lands from Cogges (by Witney) to Banbury, about 
18 miles." In 1537 he was knighted. The religious changes 
made by Edward VI. were repugnant to him, but at the beginning 
of Mary's reign he became a member of the privy council. In 
1556 he was sent to reside as guardian in Elizabeth's house. 
As early as 1555 he had begun to arrange for the endowment of a 
college at Oxford, for which he bought the site and buildings of 
Durham College, the Oxford house of the abbey of Durham, from 
Dr George Owen and William Martyn. He received a royal 
charter for the establishment and endowment of a college of the 
" Holy and Undivided Trinity " on the 8th of March 1556. The 
foundation provided for a president, twelve fellows and eight 
scholars, with a schoolhouse at Hooknorton. The number of 
scholars, was subsequently increased to twelve, the schoolhouse 
being given up. On the 28th of March the members of the 
college were put in possession of the site, and they were formally 
admitted on the 29th of May 1556. Pope died at Clerkenwell 
on the 29th of January 1559, and was buried at St Stephen's,

Walbrook; but his remains were subsequently removed to 
Trinity College, where his widow erected a semi-Gothic alabaster 
monument to his memory. He was three times married, but 
left no children. Much of his property was left to charitable 
and religious foundations, and the bulk of his Oxfordshire 
estates passed to the family of his brother, John Pope of 
Wroxton, and his descendants, the viscounts Dillon and the 
earls of Guilford and barons North. 

The life, by H. E. D. Blakiston, in the Diet. Nat. Biog., corrects 
many errors in Thomas Warton's Life of Sir Thomas Pope (1772). 
Further notices by the same authority are in his Trinity College 
(1898), in the "College Histories" Series, and in the English 
Historical Review (April, 1896). 

POPE-JOAN, a round game of cards, named after a legendary 
female Pope of the 9th century. An ordinary pack is used, from 
which the eight of diamonds has been iemoved, and a special 
round board in the form of eight compartments, named respec- 
tively Pope-Joan, Matrimony, Intrigue, Ace, King, Queen, Knave 
and Game (King, Queen and Knave are sometimes omitted). 
Each player — any number can play — contributes a stake, of 
which one counter is put into the divisions Ace, King, Queen, 
Knave and Game, two into Matrimony and Intrigue, and the 
rest into Pope- Joan. This is called " dressing the board." The 
cards are dealt round, with an extra hand for " stops," i.e. cards 
which stop, by their absence, the completion of a suit; thus the 
absence of the nine of spades stops the playing of the ten. The 
last card is turned up for trumps. Cards in excess may be dealt 
to " stops," or an agreed number may be left for the purpose, so 
that all players may have an equal number of cards. If an 
honour or " Pope " (nine of diamonds) is turned up, the dealer 
takes the counters in the compartment so marked. Sometimes 
the turning-up of Pope settles the hand, the dealer taking the 
whole pool. The Ace is the lowest card, the King the highest. 
The player on the dealer's left plays a card and names it; the 
player who has the next highest then plays it, till a stop is played, 
i.e. a card of which no one holds the next highest. All Kings are 
of course stops, also the seven of diamonds; also the cards next 
below the dealt stops, and the cards next below the played cards. 
After a stop the played cards are turned over, and the player of 
the stop (the card last played) leads again. The player who gets 
rid of all his cards first takes the counters in " Game," and 
receives a counter from each player for every card left in his 
hand, except from the player who may hold Pope but has not 
played it. The player of Ace, King, Queen or Knave of trumps 
takes the counters from that compartment. If King and Queen 
of trumps are in one hand, the holder takes the counters in 
" Matrimony "; if a Queen and Knave, those in " Intrigue "; if 
all three, those in the two compartments; if they are in different 
hands these counters are sometimes divided. Unclaimed stakes 
are left for the next pool. Pope is sometimes considered a 
universal " stop." 

POPERINGHE, an ancient town of West Flanders, 12 m. W. of 
Ypres. Pop. (1904), 11,680. It contains a fine church of the 
nth century, dedicated to St Betin. In the 14th century it 
promised to become one of the principal communes in Flanders; 
but having incurred the resentment of Ypres on a matter of trade 
rivalry it was attacked and captured by the citizens of that 
place, who reduced it to a very subordinate position. There are 
extensive hop gardens, bleaching grounds and tanneries in the 
neighbourhood of the town. 

POPHAM, SIR HOME RIGGS (1 762-1820), British admiral, 
was the son of Stephen Popham, consul at Tetuan, and was 
his mother's twenty-first child. He entered the navy in 1778, 
and served with the flag of Rodney till the end of the war. In 
1783 he was promoted lieutenant, and was for a time engaged 
on survey service on the coast of Africa. Between 1787 and 1793 
he was engaged in a curious series of adventures of a commercial 
nature in the Eastern Sea — sailing first for the Imperial Ostend 
Company, and then in a vessel which he purchased and in part 
loaded himself. During this time he took several surveys and 
rendered some services to the East India Company, which were 
officially acknowledged; but in 1793 his ship was seized, partly 



on the ground that he was carrying contraband and partly 
because he was infringing the East India Company's monopoly. 
His loss was put at £70,000, and he was entangled in litigation. 
In 1805 he obtained compensation to the amount of £25,000. 
The case was a hard one, for he was undoubtedly sailing with the 
knowledge of officials in India. While this dispute was going 
on Popham had resumed his career as a naval officer. He 
served with the army under the duke of York in Flanders as 
" superintendent of Inland Navigation " and won his confidence. 
The protection of the duke was exercised with so much effect that 
Popham was promoted commander in 1794 and post captain in 
1795. He was now engaged for years in co-operating in a naval 
capacity with the troops of Great Britain and her allies. In the 
Red Sea he was engaged in transporting the Indian troops em- 
ployed'in the expulsion of the French from Egypt. His bills 
for the repair of his ship at Calcutta were made the excuse for 
an attack on him and for charging him with the amount. It 
was just the time of the general reform of the dockyards, and 
there was much suspicion in the air. It was also the case that 
St Vincent did not like Popham, and that Benjamin Tucker 
(1762-1829), secretary to the admiralty, who had been the 
admiral's secretary, was his creature and sycophant. Popham 
was not the man to be snuffed out without an effort. He 
brought his case before Parliament, and was able to prove that 
there had been, if not deliberate dishonesty, at least the very 
grossest carelessness on the part of his assailants. In 1806 he 
co-operated with Sir David Baird in the occupation of the Cape. 
He then persuaded the authorities that, as the Spanish Colonies 
were discontented, it would be easy to promote a rising in Buenos 
Ayres. The attempt was made with Popham's squadron and 
1400 soldiers; but the Spanish colonists, though discontented, 
were not disposed to accept British help, which would in all 
probability have been made an excuse for establishing dominion. 
They rose on the soldiers who landed, and took them prisoners. 
Popham was recalled, and censured by a court martial for leaving 
his station; but the City of London presented him with a sword 
of honour for his endeavours to " open new markets," and the 
sentence did him no harm. He held other commands in con- 
nexion with the movements of troops, was promoted rear admiral 
in 1814, and made K.C.B. in 181 5. He died at Cheltenham on 
the 10th of September 1820, leaving a large family. Popham 
was one of the most scientific seamen of his time. He did much 
useful survey work, and was the author of the code of signals 
adopted by the admiralty in 1803 and used for many years. 

POPHAM, SIR JOHN (c. 1 531-1607), English judge, was 
born at Huntworth, in Somerset, about 1531. He was educated at 
Balliol College,Oxford, and called to the bar at the Middle Temple. 
Concerning his early life little is known, but he was probably a 
member of the parliament of 1558. He was recorder of Bristol, 
and represented that city in parliament in 1571 and from 1572 
to 1583. He was elected Speaker in 1580, and in 1581 became 
attorney-general, a post which he occupied until his appoint- 
ment as lord chief justice in 1592. He presided at the 
trials of Sir Walter Raleigh and Guy Fawkes. Towards the end 
of his life Popham took a great interest in colonization, and was 
instrumental in procuring patents for the London and Plymouth 
companies for the colonization of Virginia. Popham was an 
advocate, too, of transportation abroad as a means of punishing 
rogues and vagabonds. His experiment in that direction, the 
Popham colony, an expedition under the leadership of his brother 
George (c. 1 550-1608), had, however, but a brief career in its 
settlement (1607) on the Kennebec river. Popham died on the 
10th of June 1607, and was buried at Wellington, Somerset.

POPILIA (or Popillia), VIA, the name of two ancient roads in 
Italy. (1) A highroad running from the Via Appia at Capua to 
Regium, a distance of 321 m. right along the length of the 
peninsula, and the main road through the interior of the country, 
not along the coast. It was built in 159 B.C. by the censor M. 
Popilius Laenias or in 132 B.C. by the consul P. Popilius. (2) A

highroad from Ariminum to Aquileia along the Adriatic coast. 
It no doubt originally came into use when Aquileia was founded 
as a frontier fortress of Italy in 181 B.C., and Polybius gives the 
distance correctly as 17S m. In 132 it was reconstructed (munila) 
by the consul P. Popilius, one of whose milestones has been 
found near Atria. It ran along the shore strip (Lido) from Ari- 
minum to Ravenna {33 m.), where it was usual in imperial times 
for travellers to take ship and go by canal to Altinum (q.v.) f 
and there resume their journey by road, though we find the 
stations right through on the Tabula Peutingeriana, and Narses 
marched in 552 from Aquileia to Ravenna. (T. As.) 

POPINJAY (O. Fr. papegai, or popingay, onomatopoeic, 
original), an old name for a parrot. Except in its transferred 
sense of a dressed-up, vain or conceited, empty-headed person, 
the word is now only used historically of a representation or 
image of a parrot swinging from a high pole and used as a mark 
for archery or shooting matches. This shooting at the popinjay 
(see Archery) was formerly a favourite sport. " Popinjay " 
is still the proper heraldic term for a parrot as a bearing or 
charge. 

POPLAR, an eastern metropolitan borough of London, 
England, bounded N. by Hackney, S. by the river Thames, and 
W. by Stepney and Bethnal Green, and extending E. to the 
boundary of the county of London. Pop. (1901), 168,822. 
The river Lea, which the eastern boundary generally follows, is 
believed to have been crossed towards the north of the modern 
borough by a Roman road, the existence of which is recalled by 
the district-name of Old Ford; while Bow (formerly Stratford- 
le-Bow or Stratford-atte-Bowe) was so named from the " bow " 
or arched bridge which took the place of the ford in the time of 
Henry II. South of these districts lies Bromley; in the south- 
east the borough includes Black wall; and a deep southward bend 
of the Thames here embraces the Isle of Dogs. Poplar falls 
within the great area commonly associated with a poor and 
densely crowded population under the name of the " East End." 
It is a district of narrow, squalid streets and mean houses, among 
which, however, the march of modern improvement may be seen 
in the erection of model dwellings, mission houses and churches, 
and various public buildings. In the north a part of Victoria 
Park is included. In Black wall and the Isle of Dogs streets 
give place to the extensive East and West India Docks (opened 
in 1806) and Millwall Dock, with shipbuilding, engineering, 
chemical and other works along the river. Blackwall has been 
a shipping centre from early times. From the south of the 
Isle of Dogs (the portion called Cubit t Town) a tunnel for foot- 
passengers (1902) connects with Greenwich on the opposite 
shore of the Thames, and lower down the river is the fine Black- 
wall tunnel, carrying a wide roadway, completed by the London 
County Council in 1897 at a cost, inclusive of incidental expenses, 
of £1 ,383,502. Among institutions the Poplar Accidents Hospital 
may be mentioned. Near the East India Docks is the settlement 
of St Frideswide, supported by Christ Church, Oxford. In 
Canning Town, which continues this district of poverty across 
the Lea, and so outside the county of London, are Mansfield 
House, founded from Mansfield College, Oxford; and a Women's 
Settlement, especially notable for its medical work. The 
metropolitan borough of Poplar includes the Bow and Bromley 
and the Poplar divisions of the Tower Hamlets parliamentary 
borough, each returning one member. The borough council 
consists of a mayor, 7 aldermen and 42 councillors. Area, 
23 2 77 acres. 

POPLAR (Lat. Popuhts), the name of a small group of catkin- 
bearing trees belonging to the order Salicaceae. The catkins 
of the poplars differ from those of the nearly allied willows in 
the presence of a rudimentary perianth, of obliquely cup-shaped 
form, within the toothed bractcal scales; the male flowers 
contain from eight to thirty stamens; the fertile bear a one- 
celled (nearly divided) ovary, surmounted by the deeply cleft 
stigmas; the two-valved capsule contains several seeds, each 
furnished with a long tuft of silky or cotton-like hairs. The 
leaves are broader than in most willows, and are generally 
either deltoid or ovate in shape, often cordate at the base, and 



frequently with slender petioles vertically flattened. Many of 
the species attain a large size, and all are of very rapid growth. 
The poplars are almost entirely confined to the north temperate 
zone, but a few approach or even pass its northern limit, and they 
are widely distributed within that area; they show, like the 
willows, a partiality for moist ground and often line the river-sides 
in otherwise treeless districts. There are about twenty species, 
but the number cannot be very accurately defined — several, 
usually regarded as distinct, being probably merely variable 
forms of the same type, and the ease with which the trees inter- 
cross has led to the appearance of many hybrids. All yield a 
soft, easily-worked timber, which, though .very perishable when 
exposed to weather, possesses sufficient durability when kept 
dry to give the trees a certain economic value. Many of the 
species are used for paper-making. 

Of the European kinds one of the most important and best 
marked forms is the white poplar or abele, P. alba, a tree of 
large size, with rounded spreading head and curved branches, 
which, like the trunk, are covered with a greyish white bark, 
becoming much furrowed on old stems. The leaves are ovate 
or nearly round in general outline, but with deeply waved, 
more or less lobed and indented margins and cordate base; 
the upper side is of a dark green tint, but the lower surface is 
clothed with a dense white down, which likewise covers the 
young shoots — giving, with the bark, a hoary aspect to the whole 
tree. As in all poplars, the catkins expand in early spring, long 
before the leaves unfold; the ovaries bear four linear stigma lobes; 
the capsules ripen in May. A nearly related form, which may 
be regarded as a sub-species, canescens, the grey poplar of the 
nurseryman, is distinguished from the true abele by its smaller, 
less deeply cut leaves, which are grey on the upper side, but not 
so hoary beneath as those of P. alba ; the pistil has eight stigma 
lobes. Both trees occasionally attain a height of 90 ft. or more, 
but rarely continue to form sound timber beyond the first half- 
century of growth, though the trunk will sometimes endure for 
a hundred and fifty years. The wood is very white, and, from 
its soft and even grain, is employed by turners and toy-makers, 
while, being tough and little liable to split, it is also serviceable 
for the construction of packing cases, the lining of carts and 
waggons, and many similar purposes; when thoroughly seasoned 
it makes good flooring planks, but shrinks much in drying, 
weighing about 58 lb per cubic foot when green, but only 33J lb 
when dry. The white poplar is an ornamental tree, from its 
graceful though somewhat irregular growth and its dense 
hoary foliage; it has, however, the disadvantage of throwing up 
numerous suckers for some yards around the trunk. 

The grey and white poplars are usually multiplied by long 
cuttings; the growth is so rapid in a moist loamy soil that, 
according to Loudon, cuttings 9 ft. in length, planted beside 
a stream, formed in twelve years trunks 10 in. in diameter. 
Both these allied forms occur throughout central and southern 
Europe, but, though now abundant in England, it is doubtful 
whether they are there indigenous. P. alba suffers much from 
the ravages of wood-eating larvae, and also from fungoid growths, 
especially where the branches have been removed by pruning or 
accident. 

P. nigra, the black poplar, is a tree of large growth, with dark, 
deeply-furrowed bark on the trunk, and ash-coloured branches; 
the smooth deltoid leaves, serrated regularly on the margin, are 
of the deep green tint which has given name to the tree; the 
petioles, slightly compressed, are only about half the length of 
the leaves. The black poplar is common in central and southern 
Europe and in some of the adjacent parts of Asia, but, though 
abundantly planted in Britain, is not there indigenous. The 
wood is of a yellowish tint. In former days this was the preva- 
lent poplar in Britain, and the timber was employed for the 
purposes to which that of other species is applied, but has been 
superseded by P. monilijera and its varieties; it probably fur- 
nished the poplar wood of the Romans, which, from its lightness 
and soft tough grain, was in esteem for shield-making; in con- 
tinental Europe it is still in some request; the bark, in Russia, 
is used for tanning leather, while in Kamchatka it is sometimes

ground up and mixed with meal; the gum secreted by the buds 
was employed by the old herbalists for various medicinal 
purposes, but is probably nearly inert; the cotton-like down of 
the seed has been converted into a kind of vegetable felt, and 
has also been used in paper-making. A closely related form is 
the well-known Lombardy poplar, P. fastigiata, remarkable for 
its tall, cypress-like shape, caused by the nearly vertical growth 
of the branches. Probably a mere variety of the black poplar, 
its native land appears to have been Persia or some neighbouring 
country; it was unknown in Italy in the days of Pliny, while 
from remote times it has been an inhabitant of Kashmir, the 
Punjab, and Persia, wheie it is often planted along roadsides 
for the purpose of shade; it was probably brought from these 
countries to southern Europe, and derives its popular name 
from its abundance along the banks of the Po and other rivers 
of Lombardy, where it is said now to spring up naturally from 
seed, like the indigenous black poplar. It was introduced 
into France in 1749, and appears to have been grown in Germany 
t and Britain soon after the middle of the last century, if not 
earlier. The Lombardy poplar is valuable chiefly as an orna- 
mental tree, its timber being of very inferior quality; its tall, 
erect growth renders it useful to the landscape-gardener as a 
relief to the rounded forms of other trees, or in contrast to the 
horizontal lines of the lake or river-bank where it delights to 
grow. In Lombardy and France tall hedges arc sometimes 
formed of this poplar for shelter or shade, while in the suburban 
parks of Britain it is serviceable as a screen for hiding buildings 
or other unsightly objects from view; its growth is extremely 
rapid, and it often attains a height of 100 ft. and upwards, 
while from 70 to 80 ft. is an ordinary size in favourable situa- 
tions. 

P. canadensis, the " cot ton- wood " of the western prairies, and 
its varieties are perhaps the most useful trees of the genus, often 
forming almost the only arborescent vegetation on the great 
American plains. It is a tree of rather large growth, sometimes 
100 ft. high, with rugged grey trunk 7 or 8 ft. in diameter, and with 
the shoots or young branches more or less angular; the glossy 
deltoid leaves are sharply pointed, somewhat cordate at the base, 
and with flattened petioles; the fertile catkins ripen about the middle 
of June, when their opening capsules discharge the cottony seeds 
which have given the tree its common western name ; in New England 
it is sometimes- called the " river poplar." The cotton-wood 
timber, though soft and perishable, is of value in its prairie habitats, 
where it is frequently the only available wood either for carpentry 
or fuel ; it has been planted to a considerable extent in some parts of 
Europe, but in England a form of this species known as P. monilifera 
is generally preferred from its larger and more rapid growth. In 
this well-known variety the young shoots are but slightly angled, 
and the^ branches in the second year become round; the deltoid 
short-pointed leaves are usually straight or even rounded at the base, 
but sometimes are slightly cordate; the capsules ripen in Britain 
about the middle of May. This tree is of extremely rapid growth, 
and has been known to attain a height of 70 ft. in sixteen years; 
it succeeds best in deep loamy soil, but will flourish in nearly any 
moist but well-drained situation. The timber is much used in some 
rural districts for flooring, and is durable for indoor purposes when 
protected from dry-rot; it has, like most poplar woods, the property 
of resisting fire better than other timber. The native country of 
this form has been much disputed; but, though still known in many 
British nurseries as the " black Italian poplar," it is now well ascer- 
tained to be an indigenous tree in many parts of Canada and the 
States, and is a mere variety of P. canadensis; it seems to have been 
first brought to England from Canada in 1772. In America it 
seldom attains the large size it often acquires in England, and it is 



monly 

poplar, is^ remarkable for its very large heart-shaped leaves, some- 
times 10 in, long; it is found in New England and the milder parts 
of Canada, and is frequently planted in Britain; its growth is 
extremely rapid in moist land ; the buds are covered with a balsamic 
secretion. The true balsam poplar, or tacamahac, P. balsamifera, 
abundant in most parts of Canada and the northern States, is a 
tree of rather large growth, often of somewhat fastigiate habit, with 
round shoots and oblong-ovate sharp-pointed leaves, the base never 
cordate, the petioles round, and the disk deep glossy green above 
but somewhat downy below. This tree, the " Hard " of the 
Canadian voyageur, abounds on many of the river sides of the north- 
western plains; it occurs in the neighbourhood of the Great Slave 
Lake and along the Mackenzie River, and forms much of the drift- 
wood of the Arctic coast. In these northern habitats it attains 
a large size; the wood is very soft; the buds yield a gum-like balsam, 



from which the common name is derived; considered valuable as an 
antiscorbutic, this is said also to have diuretic properties; it was 
formerly imported into Europe in small quantities under the name of 
" baume focot," being scraped off in the spring and put into shells. 
This balsam gives the tree a fragrant odour when the leaves are 
unfolding. The tree grows well in Britain, and acquires occasionally 
a considerable size. Its fragrant shoots and the fine yellow green 
of the young leaves recommend it to the ornamental planter. It is 
said by Aiton to have been introduced into Britain about the end 
of the 17th century. 

P. euphratica, believed to be the weeping willow of the Scriptures, 
is a large tree remarkable for the variability in the shape of its leaves, 
which are linear in young trees and vigorous shoots, and broad and 
ovate on older branches. It is a native of North Africa and Western 
and Central Asia, including North-West India. With the date 
palm it is believed to have furnished the rafters for the buildings of 
Nineveh. 

POPLIN, or Tabinet, a mixed textile fabric consisting of a 
silk warp with a weft of worsted yarn. As tjie weft is in the form 
of a stout cord the fabric has a ridged structure, like rep, which 
gives depth and softness to the lustre of the silky surface. 
Poplins are used for dress purposes, and for rich upholstery 
work. The manufacture is of French origin ; but it was brought 
to England by the Huguenots, and has long been specially 
associated with Ireland. The French manufacturers distinguish 
between popelines unies or plain poplins and popelines & dis- 
positions or £cossaises, equivalent to Scotch tartans, in both of 
which a large trade is done with the United States from Lyons. 

POPOCATEPETL (Aztec popoca " to smoke," tepetl " moun- 
tain "), a dormant volcano in Mexico in, lat. 18 59/ 47" N., 
long. 98 33' 1" W., which with the neighbouring Ixtaccihuatl 
(Aztec " white woman ") forms the south-eastern limit of the 
great basin known as the " Valley of Mexico." As it lies in 
the state of Puebla and is the dominating feature in the views 
from the city of that name, it is sometimes called the Puebla 
volcano. It is the second highest summit in Mexico, its shapely, 
snow-covered cone rising to a height of 17,876 ft., or 438 ft. 
short of that of Orizaba. This elevation was reported by the 
Mexican geological survey in 1895, and as the Mexican Geo- 
graphical Society calculated the elevation at 17,888 ft., it may 
be accepted as nearly correct. The bulk of the mountain con- 
sists of andesite, but porphyry, obsidian, trachyte, basalt, and 
other similar rocks are also represented. It has a stratified 
cone showing a long period of activity. At the foot of the 
eastern slope stretches a vast lava field — the "malpays" 
(malapais) of Atlachayacatl — which, according to Humboldt, 
lies 60 to 80 ft. above the plain and extends 18,000 ft. east to 
west with a breadth of 6000 ft. Its formation must be of great 
antiquity. The ascent of Popocatepetl is made on the north- 
eastern slope, where rough roads are kept open by sulphur 
carriers and timber cutters. Describing his ascent in 1904, 
Hans Gadow states that the forested region begins in the foot- 
hills a little above 8000 ft., and continues up the slope to an 
elevation of over 13,000 ft. On the lower slopes the forest is 
composed in great part of the long-leaved Pinus liophyllo, 
accompanied by deciduous oaks and a variety of other trees 
and shrubs. From about 9500 ft. to 11,500 ft. the Mexican 
" oyamel," or fir (Abies religiosa) becomes the principal species, 
interspersed with evergreen oak, arbutus and elder. Above this 
belt the firs gradually disappear and arc succeeded by the short- 
leaved Pinus montezumae, or Mexican " ocote " — one of the 
largest species of pine in the republic. These continue to the 
upper tree-line, accompanied by red and purple Pentstemon and 
light blue lupins in the open spaces, some ferns, and occasional 
masses of alpine flowers. Above the tree line the vegetation 
continues only a comparatively short distance, consisting 
chiefly of tussocks of coarse grass, and occasional flowering 
plants, the highest noted being a little Draba. At about 14,500 ft. 
horses arc left behind, though they could be forced farther 
up through the loose lava and ashes. On the snow-covered 
cone the heat of the sun is intense, though the thermometer 
recorded a temperature of 34 in September. The reflection 
of light from the snow is blinding. The rim of the crater is 
reached at an elevation of about 17,500 ft. Another descrip- 
tion places the snow-line at 14,268 ft., and the upper tree-line 



POPPER— POPPY OIL

a thousand feet lower. A detailed description of the volcano 
was published by the Mexican geological survey in 1895 accord- 
ing to which the crater is elliptical in form, 2008 by 1312 ft., and 
has a depth of 1657 ft. below the summit of the highest pinnacle 
and 673 ft. below the lowest part of the rim, which is very 
irregular in height. The steep, ragged walls of the crater show 
a great variety of colours, intensified by the light from the deep 
blue sky above. Huge patches of sulphur, some still smouldering, 
are everywhere visible, intermingled with the white streaks of 
snow and ice that fill the crevices and cover the ledges of the 
black rocks. The water from the melted snow forms a small 
lake at the bottom of the crater, from which it filters through 
fissures to the heated rocks below and thence escapes as steam 
or through other fissures to the mineral springs at the moun- 
tain's base. The Indian sulphur miners go down by means 
*of ladders, or are lowered by rope and windlass, and the mineral 
is sent down the mountain side in a chute 2000 to 3000 ft. Some 
observers report that steam is to be seen rising from fissures in 
the bottom of the crater, and all are united in speaking of the 
fumes of burning sulphur that rise from its depths. That 
volcanic influences are still present may be inferred from the 
circumstance that the snow cap on Popocatepetl disappeared 
just before the remarkable series of earthquakes that shook the 
whole of central Mexico on the 30th and 31st of July 1909. 

It is believed that Diego de Ordaz was the first European to 
reach the summit of Popocatepetl, though no proof of this remains 
further than that Cortes sent a party of ten men in 1 519 to ascend 
a burning mountain. In 1522 Francisco Montano made the 
ascent and had himself let down into the crater a depth of 400 or 
500 ft. No second ascent is recorded until April and November 
1827 (see Brantz Mayer, Mexico, vol. h\). Other ascents were 
made in 1834, 1848 and subsequent years, members of the 
Mexican geological survey spending two days on the summit in 

1895. 

POPPER, DAVID (1846- ), Bohemian violoncellist, was 
born at Prague, and educated musically at the conscrvatorium 
there, adopting the 'cello as his professional instrument. He was 
soon recognized, largely through von Bulow, as one of the 
finest soloists of the time, and played on tours throughout the 
European capitals. In 1872 he married the pianist Sophi 
Menter, from whom he was separated in 1886. In 1896 he 
became professor at the Royal Conservatoire at Budapest. He 
published various works, mainly compositions for the 'cello, 
together with four volumes of studies arranged as a violoncello 
school. 

POPPO, ERNST FRIEDRICH (1794-1866), German classical 
scholar and schoolmaster, was born at Guben in Brandenburg 
on the 13th of August, 1794. In 1818 he was appointed director 
of the gymnasium at Frankfort -on-the-Oder, where he died on 
the 6th of November 1866, having resigned his post three years 
before. Poppo was an extremely successful teacher and 
organizer, and in a few years doubled the number of pupils 
at the gymnasium. He is chiefly known, however, for his 
exhaustive and complete edition of Thucydides in four parts 
(n vols., 1821-1840), containing (i.) prolegomena on Thucydides 
as an historian and on his language and style (Eng. trans, by 
G. Burges, 1837), accompanied by historical and geographical 
essays; (ii.) text with scholia and critical notes; (iii.) commentary 
on the text and scholia; (iv.) indices and appendices. For the 
ordinary student a smaller edition (1 843-1 851) was prepared, 
revised after the author's death by J. M. Stahl (1875-1889).

there referred to. 

POPPY, in botany, a genus of plants known botanically as 
papaver } the type of the family or natural order Papaveraceae. 
They are annual and perennial erect herbs containing a milky 
juice, with lobed or cut leaves and generally long-stalked regular 
showy flowers, which are nodding in the bud stage. The 
sepals, very rarely three, which are two in number, fall off as 
the flower opens, the four (very rarely five or six) petals, which 
are crumpled in the bud stage, also fall readily. The numerous 
stamens surround the ovary, which is composed of 4 to 16 carpels 



and is surmounted by a flat or convex rayed disk bearing the 
stigmas. The ovary is incompletely divided into many chambers 
by the ingrowth of the placentas which bear numerous ovules 
and form in the fruit a many-seeded short capsule opening by 
small valves below the upper edge. The valves are hydroscopic, 
responding to increase in the amount of moisture in the atmo- 
sphere by closing the apertures. In dry weather the valves 
open, and the small seeds are ejected through the pores when 
the capsule is shaken by the wind on its long stiff slender stalk. 
The flowers contain no honey and are visited by pollen-seeking 
insects, which alight on the broad stigmatic surface. The 
genus contains about 40 species, mostly natives of central and 
south Europe and temperate Asia. Five species are British; 
P. Rhoeas is the common scarlet poppy found in cornfields and 
waste places. Cultivated forms of this, with exquisite shades 
of colour and without any blotch at the base of the petals, are 
known as Shirley poppies. P. somniferum, the opium poppy, 
with large white or blue-purple flowers, is widely cultivated (see 
Opium). The Oriental poppy (P. orientate) and its several 
varieties are fine garden plants, having huge bright crimson 
flowers with black blotches at the base. Many hybrid forms of 
varying shades of colour have been raised of late years. The 
Iceland poppy (P. itndicaule), is one of the showiest species, 
having grey-green pinnate leaves and flowers varying in colour 
from pure white to deep orange-yellow, orange-scarlet, &c. 
Specially fine varieties with stalks 18-24 in. high are cultivated 
on a large scale by some growers for market. The Welsh poppy 
belongs to an allied genus, Meconopsis; it is a perennial herb 
with a yellow juice and pale yellow poppy-like flowers. It is 
native in the south-west and north of England, and in Wales; 
also in Ireland. The prickly poppy (Argemont grandiflora) is 
a fine Mexican perennial with large white flowers. 

To the same family belongs the horned poppy, Glaucium 
luteitntj found in sandy sea-shores and characterized by the waxy 
bloom of its leaves and large golden-yellow short-stalked 
flowers. Another member of the family is Eschscholtzia cali- 
fornicaj a native of western North America, and well-known 
in gardens, with orange-coloured flowers and a long two-valved 
fruit pod. 

The plume poppy (Bocconia cordate and B. microcarpd) are 
ornamental foliage plants of great beauty. The cyclamen 
poppy (Eomecon chionantha) is a pretty Chinese perennial, 
having roundish slightly lobed leaves and pure white flowers 
about 2 in. across. The tree poppy (Dendromecon rigidum) is 
a Californian shrub about 3 ft. high, having golden-yellow flowers 
about 2 in. across. The Californian poppy {Platystcmon cali- 
fornictts) is a pretty annual about a foot high, having yellow 
flowers with 3 sepals and 6 petals; and the white bush poppy 
{Romneya Coultcri) is a very attractive perennial and semi- 
shrubby plant 2-8 ft. high, with pinnatifid leaves and large 
sweet scented white flowers often 6 in. across. 

POPPY HEADS, a term, in architecture, given to the finials 
or other ornaments which terminate the tops of bench ends, 
either to pews or stalls. They are sometimes small human heads, 
sometimes richly carved images, knots of foliages or finials, and 
sometimes fleurs-de-lis simply cut out of the thickness of the 
bench end and chamfered. The term is probably derived 
from the French poupte, doll, puppet, used also in this sense, 
or from the flower, from a resemblance in shape. 

POPPY OIL {Oleum papavcris), a vegetable oil obtained by 
pressure from the minute seeds of the garden or opium poppy, 
Papaver somniferum. The white-seeded and black-seeded 
varieties are both used for oil-pressing; but, when the production 
of oil is the principal object of the culture, the black seed is 
usually preferred. The qualities of the oil yielded by both 
varieties and the proportion they contain (from 50 to 60%) are 
the same. By cold pressing seeds of fine quality yield from 30 to 
40% of virgin or white oil (huile blaticlie), a transparent limpid 
fluid with a slight yellowish tinge, bland and pleasant to taste, 
and with almost no perceptible smell. On second pressure with 
the aid of heat an additional 20 to 25% of inferior oil (huile de 
fabrique or huile russe) is obtained, reddish in colour, possessed 



9 2

of a biting taste, and a linseed-like smell. The oil belongs to 
the linoleic or drying series, having as its principal constituent 
linolein; and it possesses greater drying power than raw linseed 
oil. Its specific gravity at 15 C. is 0-925. Poppy oil is a valu- 
able and much used medium for artistic oil painting. The fine 
qualities are largely used in the north of France (huile d 1 ceillette) 
and in Germany as a salad oil, and are less liable than olive oil 
to rancidity. The absence of taste and characteristic smell in 
poppy oil also leads to its being much used for adulterating olive 
oil. The inferior qualities are principally consumed in soap- 
making and varnish-making, and for burning in lamps. The 
oil is very extensively used in the valley of the Ganges and 
other opium regions for food and domestic purposes. By native 
methods in India about 30% of oil is extracted, and the remain- 
ing oleaginous cake is used as food by the poor. Ordinary 
poppy-oil cake is a valuable feeding material, rich in nitrogenous 
constituents, with an ash showing an unusually large proportion 
of phosphoric acid. The seed of the yellow horned poppy,

POPULATION (Lat. populus, people; popular e, to populate), a 
term used in two different significations, (1) for the total number 
of human beings existing within certain area at a given time, and 
(2) for the " peopling " of the area, or the influence of the 
various forces of which that number is the result. The popu- 
lation of a country, in the former sense of the word, is ascertained 
by means of a census (q.v.), which periodically records the number 
of people found in it on a certain date. 'Where, as is generally 
the case, detail of sex, age, conjugal condition and birthplace 
is included in the return, the census results can be co-ordinated 
with those of the parallel registration of marriages, births, deaths 
and migration, thus forming the basis of what are summarily 
termed vital statistics, the source of our information regarding 
the nature and causes of the process of " peopling," i.e. the 
movement of the population between one census and another. 
Neither of these two operations has yet reached perfection, 
either in scope or accuracy, though the census, being the subject 
of special and concentrated effort, is generally found the superior 
in the latter respect, and is in many cases taken in countries 
where registration has not yet been introduced. The countries 
where neither is in force aie still, unfortunately, very 
numerous. 

The Population of the World, and its Geographical Distribution. 
— Man is the only animal which has proved able to pass from 
dependence upon its environment to a greater or less control 
over it. He alone, accordingly, has spread over every quarter 
of the globe. The area and population of the world, as a whole, 
have been the subject of many estimates in scientific works for 
the last three centuries and are still to a considerable extent 
matters of rough approximation. Every decade, however, 
brings a diminution of the field of conjecture, as some form of 
civilized administration is extended over the more backward 
tracts, and is followed, in due course, by a survey and a census. 
It is not necessary, therefore, to cite the estimates framed before 
1882, when a carefully revised summary was published by Boehm 
and H. Wagner. Since then the laborious investigations of 
P. F. Levasseur and L. Bodio have 
been completed in the case of Europe 
and America, and, for the rest of the 
world, the figures annually brought up 
to date in the Statesman's Year Book 
may be taken to be the best avail- 
able. From these sources the 
abstract at foot of page has been 
derived. 

The principal tracts still un- 
measured and unenumerated (in any 
strict sense) in the Old World are the 
Turkish Empire, Persia, Afghanistan, 
China and the Indo-Chinese peninsula 



and nearly nine-tenths of Africa. In the same category must 1 
placed a considerable proportion of central, southern and Polar 
America (see Census). There is little of the world which is 
entirely uninhabited; still less permanently uninhabitable and 
unlikely to be required to support a population in the course of 
the expansion of the race beyond its present abodes. Probably 
the polar regions alone do not fall within the category of the poten- 
tially productive, as even sandy and alkaline desert is rendered 
habitable where irrigation can be introduced; and vast tracts 
of fertile soil adapted for immediate exploitation, especially 
in the temperate zones, both north and south, only remain 
unpeopled because they are not yet wanted for colonization. 
The geographical distribution of the population of the world 
is therefore extremely irregular, and, omitting from consideration 
areas but recently colonized, the density is regulated by the 
means of subsistence within reach. u La population," say 
G. de Molinari, " a tendance de se proportionner a son debouche." 
These, in their turn, depend mainly upon the character of the 
people who inhabit the country. Even amongst savages there 
are few communities, and those but sparse, which subsist entirety 
upon what is directly provided by nature. As human intelli- 
gence and industry come into play the means of livelihood are 
proportionately extended; population multiplies, and with this 
multiplicatiori production increases. Thus, the higher densities 
are found in the eastern hemisphere, within the zone in which 
arose the great civilizations of the world, or, roughly speaking, 
between north parallels 25 and 40 towards the east, and 25 and 
55 in the west. Here large areas with a mean density of over 
500 to the sq. m. may be found either supported by the 
food directly produced by themselves, as in the great agricultural 
plains of the middle kingdom of China and the Ganges valley and 
delta; or else, as in western Europe, relying largely upon food 
from abroad, purchased by the products of manufacturing 
industry. In the one class the density is mainly rural, in the 
other it is chiefly due to the. concentration of the population 
into large urban aggregates. It is chiefly from the populations 
of the south-west of Europe that the New World is being colo- 
nized; but the territories over which the settlers and their recruits 
from abroad are able to scatter are so extensive that even the 
lower densities of the Old World have not yet been attained, 
except in a few tracts along the eastern coasts of Australia and 
North America. Details of area and population are given under 
the headings of the respective countries, and the only general 
point in connexion with the relation between these two facts 
which may be mentioned here is the need to bear in mind that the 
larger the territory the less likely is its mean density-figure to 
be typical or really representative. Even in the case of small 
and comparatively homogeneous countries such as Holland, 
Belgium or Saxony there is considerable deviation from the 
mean in the density of the respective component subdivisions, 
a difference which when extended over more numerous aggre- 
gates often renders the general mean misleading or of little value. 
Distribution of Population by Sex. — After geographical dis- 
persion, the most general feature amongst the human race is its 
division by sex. The number of speculations as to the nature 
of this distinction has been, it is said, well-nigh doubled since 
Drelincourt, in the 18th century, brought together 262 " ground- 
less hypotheses," and propounded on his own part a theory

which has since been held to be the 263rd in the series. It is 
not proposed to deal here with incidents appertaining to the 
" ante-natal gloom," and we are concerned only with human 
beings when once they have been born. In regard to the division 
of these into male and female, the first point to be noted is that, 
in all communities of western civilization, more boys are born 
than girls. The excess ranges from 20 to 60 per thousand. 
In Greece and Rumania it is exceptionally high, and in some 
Oriental or semi-Oriental countries it is said to give place to a 
deficit, though in the latter case the returns are probably not 
trustworthy. From the more accurate statistics available it 
appears that the excess of male births varies amongst different 
races and also at different times in the same community. It 
is high in new colonies and amongst the Latin races, with the 
exception of the French. These, with the English, show a 
much smaller excess of boy-births than the average of western 
Europe, and the proportion, moreover, seems to be somewhat 
declining in both these countries and in Belgium, from causes 
which have not yet been ascertained. As the mortality amongst 
boys, especially during the first year, is considerably above that 
of the other sex, numerical equilibrium between the two is estab- 
lished in early youth, and in most cases girls outnumber boys, 
except for a few years between twelve and sixteen. Then follows 
the chequered period of the prime of life and middle age, during 
which the liability of men to industrial accidents, war and other 
causes of special mortality, irrespective of their greater incli- 
nation to emigrate, is generally sufficient to outweigh the dangers 
of childbirth or premature decay among the women, who tend, 
accordingly, to predominate in number at this stage. In old 
age, again, their vitality rises superior to that of the men, and 
they continue to form the majority of the community. The 
general results are an excess of females over males throughout 
western Europe: but though the relative proportions vary from 
time to time, remaining always in favour of what is conventionally 
called the weaker sex, it is impossible, owing to disturbing factors 
like war and migration, to ascertain whether there is any general 
tendency for the proportion of females to increase or not. In 
comparatively new settlements, largely fed by immigration, the 
number of males is obviously likely to be greater than that of 
females, but in the case of countries in Asia and eastern Europe 
in which also a considerable deficiency of the latter sex is indi- 
cated by the returns, it is probable that the strict seclusion 
imposed by convention on women and the consequent reticence 
regarding them on the part of the householders answering 
the official inquiry tend towards a short count. On the other 
hand, the lower position there assigned to women and the very 
considerable amount of hard work exacted from them, may 
cause them to wear out earlier than under higher conditions, 
though not to the extent implied in the statistics. In the

following table the latest available information on this head is 
given for representative countries of western and eastern Europe, 
the East and the New World. 

Distribution by Age. — Few facts are more uncertain about an 
individual than the number of years he will live. Few, on 
the contrary, as was pointed out by C. Babbage, are less subject 
to fluctuation than the duration of life amongst people taken in 
large aggregates. The age-constitution of a community does 
indeed vary, and to a considerable extent, in course of time, but 
the changes are usually gradual, and often spread over a genera- 
tion or more. At the same time, it must be admitted that 
those which have recently taken place amongst most of the 
communities of western Europe are remarkable for both their 
rapidity and their extent; and are probably attributable, in 
part at least, to influences which were almost inoperative at the 
time when Babbage wrote. The distribution of a population 
amongst the different periods of life is regulated, in normal 
circumstances, by the birth-rate, and, as the mortality at some 
of the periods is far greater than at others, the death-rate falls 
indirectly under the same influence. The statistics of age, there- 
fore, may be said to form a link between those of the population, 
considered as a fixed quantity, as at a census, and those which 
record its movement from year to year. To the correct interpre- 
tation of the latter, indeed, they are essential, as will appear 
below. Unfortunately, the return of age is amongst the less 
satisfactory results of a general enumeration, though its inaccu- 
racy, when spread over millions of persons, is susceptible of 
correction mathematically, to an extent to make it serve its 
purpose in the directions above indicated. The error in the 
original return generally arises from ignorance. An illiterate 
population is very prone to state its age in even multiples of five, 
and even where education is widely spread this tendency is not 
altogether absent, as may be seen from the examples given in 
Table III.

Table III. Deliberate mis-statements, too, are not unknown, 
especially amongst women. This has been repeatedly illustrated 
in the English census reports. Irrespective of the wish of women 
between 25 and 40 to return themselves as under 25, there appears 
to be the more practical motive of obtaining better terms in 
industrial insurance, whilst an overstatement of age often has, it 
is said, the object of getting better wages in domestic service, or 
better dietary in the workhouse 1 In all countries, moreover, 
there seems to be an inclination to exaggerate longevity after the 
three score years and ten have been passed. In order to minimize 
the results of such inaccuracy, the return of ages is compiled in 
aggregates of five or ten years and then redistributed over single 
years by the method of differences. The present purpose being 
merely to illustrate the variation of distribution amongst a few 
representative countries, it is unnecessary to enter into more 
detail than such as will serve to distinguish the proportions of 
the population in main divisions of life. Thus it may be said 
that in the west of Europe about one-third of the people, roughly 
speaking, are under fifteen; about one-half, between that age and 
fifty, and the remaining sixth older than fifty. The middle period

POPULATION 



may conveniently be extended to sixty and subdivided at forty, 
as is done in Table IV. The differences between the several 
countries in their age-constitution can best be appreciated by 
reference to some recognized general standard. The one here 
adopted is the result of the co-ordination of a long series 
of enumerations taken in Sweden during the last century and 
a half, prepared by Dr G. Sundbarg of Stockholm. It is true 
that for practical use in connexion with vital statistics for a 
given period, the aggregate age-distribution of the countries 
concerned would be a more accurate basis of comparison, but 
the wide period covered by the Swedish observations has the 
advantage of eliminating temporary disturbances of the balance 
of ages, and may thus be held to compensate for the compara- 
tively narrow geographical extent of the field to which it relates.

As regards correspondence with the standard distribution, it 
will be noted that Finland, the next country to Sweden geo- 
graphically, comes after Japan, far detached from northern 
Europe by both race and distance, and is followed by Portugal, 
where the conditions are also very dissimilar. The other 
Scandinavian countries, Norway and Denmark, appear, like 
Sweden itself in the present day, to bear in their age-distribution 
distinct marks of the emigration of adults, or, at least, the 
temporary absence from home of this class at the time of enume- 
ration. The same can be said of Italy in its later returns and of 
Germany in those before 1895. On the contrary, the effect of 
the inflow of adult migrants is very marked, as is to be expected, 
in the returns for the new countries, such as the United States, 
Canada and Australasia. In the case of the Old World, the 
divergence from the standard which most deserves notice is the 
remarkable preponderance of the young in all the countries of 
eastern Europe, as well as in India, accompanied by an equally 
notable deficiency of the older elements in the population. 
Again, there are in the west two well-known instances of deficient 
reinforcement of the young, France and Ireland, in which 
countries the proportion of those under 15 falls respectively 
75 and 32 per mille below the standard; throwing those over 
60 up to 41 and 26 per mille above it. The table does not in- 
clude figures for earlier enumerations, but one general character- 



istic in them should be mentioned, viz. the far higher proportion 
borne in them of the young, as compared with the mere recent 
returns. In England, for instance, those under 1 5 amounted to 
360 per mille in 1841, against 324 sixty years later. In Ireland 
the corresponding fall has been still more marked, from 382 to 
304. The ratio in France was low throughout the 19th century, 
and during the last half fell only from 273 to 261, raising the 
proportion of the old above that resulting in northern Europe 
and Italy from emigration. It is remarkable that the same 
tendency for the proportion of the young to fall off is perceptible 
in new countries as well as in the older civilizations, setting aside 
the influence of immigration at the prime of life in depressing 
the proportion of children. The possible causes of this wide- 
spread tendency of the mean age of a western community to 
increase appertain to the subject of the movement of the 
population, which is dealt with below. 

The Movement of Population. — " The true greatness of a 
State " says Bacon, " consisteth essentially in population and 
breed of men "; and an increasing population is one of the most 
certain signs of the well-being of a community. Successive 
accretions, however, being spread over so long a term as that of 
human life, it does not follow that the population at any given 
time is necessarily the result of contemporary prosperity. Con- 
versely, the traces left by a casual set-back, such as famine, war, 
or an epidemic disease, remain long after it has been succeeded 
by a period of recuperation, and are to be found in the age- 
constitution and the current vital statistics. Population is 
continually in a state of motion, and in large aggregates the 
direction is invariably towards increase. The forces underlying 
the movement may differ from time to time in their respective 
intensity, and, in highly exceptional cases, may approach 
equilibrium, their natural tendencies being interrupted by special 
causes, but the instances of general decline are confined to wild 
and comparatively small communities brought into contact 
with alien and more civilized races. The factors upon which 
the growth of a population depend are internal, operating 
within the community, or external, arising out of the relations 
of the community with other countries. In the latter case, 
population already in existence is transferred from one territory 
to another by migration, a subject which will be referred to 
later. Far more important is the vegetative, or " natural " 
increase, through the excess of births over deaths. The 
principal influences upon this, in civilized life, are the number 
of the married, the age at which they marry or bear children, 
the fertility of marriages and the duration of life, each of which 
is in some way or other connected with the others. 

Marriage. — In every country a small and generally diminish- 
ing proportion of the children is born out of wedlock, but the 
primary regulator of the native growth of a community is the 
institution of marriage. Wherever, it has been said, there is 
room for two to live up to the conventional standard of comfort, 
a marriage takes place. So close, indeed, up to recent times, 
was the connexion held to be between the prosperity of the 
country and the number of marriages, that Dr W. Farr used to 
call the latter the barometer of the former. The experience 
of the present generation, however, both in England and other 
countries, seems to justify some relaxation of that view, as will 
appear below. The tendency of a community towards matri- 
mony, or its " nuptiality," as it is sometimes termed, is usually 
indicated by the ratio to the total population of the persons 
married each year. For the purpose of comparing the circum- 
stances of the same community at successive periods this method 
is fairly trustworthy, assuming that there has been no material 
shifting of the age-proportions during the intervals. It is not 
a safe guide, however, when applied to the comparison of 
different communities, the age-composition of which is probably 
by no means identical, but in consideration of its familiarity 
it has been adopted in the first section of Table V. below, at 
three periods for each of the countries selected as representative. 

One of the features which is prominent throughout the return 
is that in every country except Belgium the rate per mille 
attained a maximum in the early seventies, and has since shown 



POPULATION

a descending tendency, notwithstanding the fact, noted in the 
preceding paragraph, that the youthful population, which, of 
course, weighs down the rate, has also been relatively decreasing. 
Countries' of Oriental and semi-Oriental habits have not been 
shown, owing to the difference in their marriage system from 
that of western Europe. It may be mentioned, however, in 
passing, that their marriage rate is generally considerably higher 
than that here indicated, as may be seen from the example of 
Galicia, which is here shown separately from cis-Leithian Austria.

years of age and decreases rapidly as that period is left behind. 
A Swedish return of 1896-1900 shows that the annual births per 
thousand wives of 20-25 are fewer by nearly 17% than those of 
wives under 20. Between 25 and 30 the number falls off by 
one-fifth, and after 40 by about 44%. In the countries 
mentioned in Table V. the average proportion borne by wives 
under 30 to the total under 45 is just over one-third. That 
proportion is exceeded in southern Europe, where women develop 
earlier, and in Galicia. In England and France it stands at

In the opposite direction will be noted the case of Ireland, 
where the rate is abnormally low; and returns more recent 
than those included in the table show that of late the rates in 
Sweden and Norway have also fallen to but little above n per 
millc. In regard to the necessity of taking into consideration 
the factor of age in the return of marriage-rates, an example may 
be here given from the data for England. The rate taken upon 
the total population was 16*7 per mille in 1870-1871 and 15*3 in 
1905; by excluding the population under fifteen the corre- 
sponding figures are 57-2 and 46*6 per mille. Thus the decline, 
which by the first method is only 8%, becomes, by the second, 
19%; and if the age-distribution of 1905 were reduced to that of 
the earlier period, the difference would increase to- 22%, the 
most accurate figure of the three. For the present purpose it 
is sufficient to connect the rate of marriage with that of births 
by using as a basis for the former the number of women of 
conceptivc age, or between 15 and 45 years old. The propor- 
tion of these is given in the latter portion of the table. Again 
taking England as an example, the women of the above ages 
bore the proportion to the total population of 23% in 
1871 and had risen to 25% in 1901; but at the former time, 
49-6% were married, whilst thirty years later, only 46*8 were 
thus situated. The table also shows that the proportion of 
the women of the ages in question who were married exceeds 
half only in Italy, France and Germany, not to mention Galicia. 
In other countries the average proportion is about 45%. In 
Sweden and Norway it is only 41 and in Ireland less than a 
third. In Scandinavia, and perhaps in Italy, the rate may be 
affected by the emigration of adult males, but the later columns 
of the table indicate that this is not the cause of the low rate in 
Ireland, which appears to be mainly due to abstinence from 
marriage at the ages specified. 

Next to the proportion of the married to the total marriageable 
the most important factor connected with the natural increase 
of the population is the age at which marriage takes place. 
Where the proportion of the married is high, the average age of 
the wives is low, and early marriage is conducive to relatively 
rapid increase. In the first place, the interval between genera- 
tions is shortened, and the elder is contemporaneous with the 
younger for a longer period. Then, again, the fecundity of women 
amongst western peoples is at its maximum between 18 and 25 



36. In Ireland and Sweden it is only 28, and in Denmark, 
Holland and Norway, too, it is below the average. The registrar- 
general of England has pointed out a marked tendency towards 
the postponement of marriage in that country. Between 1876 
and 1905, for instance, the proportion of minors married receded 
by 43% m the case of men and 32% amongst women. The 
mean age of husbands married in 1873 was 25-6 years and of 
wives 24*2, whereas thirty years later the corresponding ages 
were 28-6 and 26-4. The general results of the decline of the 
marriage-rate and the postponement of marriage upon the 
natural growth of population will be discussed in connection 
with the birth-rate, though the statistics available do not permit 
of the accurate measurement of the respective influence of these 
factors, and there are others, too, winch have to be taken into 
consideration, as will appear below. 

Births* — Apart from the information which the statistics of 
birth furnish as to the growth of population, they have, like 
those of marriage, and perhaps to even a greater extent, a 
special social interest from their bearings upon the moral con- 
ditions of the community to which they relate. It is in their 
former capacity, however, that they enter into the ptesent sub- 
ject. A birth-rate, taken as it usually is upon the total popu- 
lation, old and young, is open to the objections made above 
respecting the marriage-rate, and with even more force, as the 
basis is itself largely the product of the fact which is being 
measured by it. The internal variations of the rate in a single 
community, however, can be fairly indicated in this way, as is 
done in Table VI., which, it is to be noted, refers to those born 
alive only and excludes the still-born, statistics regarding whom 
are incomplete. 

The crude birth-rate, it will be noted, is in general harmony 
with that of marriage. In the countries where the former is 
high the rate of marriage is also above the average. In eastern 
Europe, so far as the figures can be trusted, this is markedly 
the case, and the birth-rates range between 39 per mille in 
Hungary and 49 in Russia, where the tradition of encouraging 
prolificity amongst the peasantry has not been effaced. Among 
the lower rates which prevail in western Europe, however, 
the connexion is not so direct, and a low birth-rate is some- 
times found with a relatively higher marriage rate and vice 
versa, a deviation from the natural course of events which will 



9 6 



POPULATION 



be discussed presently. The birth-rate, like the marriage-rate, 
seems to have reached its acme in the seventies, except 
in the three southern countries, France, Italy and Spain. The 
decline since the above period is very marked and exceeds 
that noted in the case of the rate of marriage. It is worth 
noting, too, that the fall in the crude birth-rate is not confined 
to the Old World, but has attracted special attention in 
Australia and New Zealand, where a rate of 40 per mille in 
the period 1861-1870 has now given place to one of 26. In 
Massachusetts and other of the older settlements of the United 
States, moreover, the same feature has been the subject of 
investigation. 



other than abstinence from marriage, at all events at the princi- 
pal reproductive period; and perhaps to a decrease in marriage 
or remarriage after middle life, a period of which the weight 
in the age-distribution has been increasing of late. On the 
other hand, the postponement of marriage in the case of women 
of conceptive ages is a tendency which seems to be growing in 
other countries as well as in England and undoubtedly has a 
depressing effect upon the rate of births. It would conduce, 
therefore, to further accuracy in the comparison of the rates of 
different countries if the latter were to be correlated with greater 
subdivision of the ages amongst wives between 15 and 45. 
The proportion of wives below 30 to the total of that group was

The crude rates which have been discussed above afford no 
explanation of this change, nor do they always illustrate its full 
extent. It is necessary, therefore, to eliminate the difference 
in the age-constitution of the countries in question by excluding 
from the field of observation, as before, all except possible 
mothers, basing the rate upon the respective numbers of women 
of the conceptive age, that is between 15 and 45. The pro- 
portion borne by this group to the total population is in most 
cases fairly up to that set forth by Dr Sundbarg in his standard. 
It is well above it in all three parts of the United Kingdom and 
falls materially below it only in Scandinavia and Italy. Indeed, 
during the last generation, this proportion has been in most 
cases slightly increased, in consequence of the fall of the 
birth-rate which set in anterior to this period. The stock, then, 
from which wives are drawn is ample. The question remains, 
how far advantage is taken of it. According to the Sundbarg 
standard the percentage married is 48. As has been shown 
in the preceding paragraph, this is surpassed in Italy, France 
and Germany, and approached in most of the rest, with the 
exception of Sweden, Norway and Scotland, which are six or 
seven points below it, and Ireland, where less than a third 
are married. The proportion married, moreover, has slightly 
increased since 1880, except in the United Kingdom. In 
England the marriage-rate (on the age basis) fell off by 4-6% 
and in Scotland by 2%, whilst the crude birth-rate declined 
by 15 and 11 % respectively. In Ireland the case was different, 
as the marriage-rate declined by 12% and the birth-rate by no 
more than 5-7 %. In New South Wales and New Zealand, too, 
the marriage-rates fell off in the same period by 11 and 28% 
respectively, whilst the decline in the birth-rates amounted to 
35 and 31 %. In the above countries, therefore, abstinence from 
matrimony may be said to have been a factor of some importance 
in the decline. On the continent of Europe, however, looking 
at the divergence in direction between the crude marriage-rate 
and that corrected to an age-basis, it is not improbable that 
the decline in the former may be attributable to some cause 



mentioned in connexion with the marriage-rate, and in the 
figures relating to some 30 years back some traces can be found 
of a connexion between a high birth-rate and a high proportion 
of young wives. In the present day, however, these indications 
do not appear, so it would seem that the tendency in question 
had been interrupted by some other influence, a point to which 
reference will be made below. 

If abstinence from marriage and the curtailment of the 
reproductive period by postponement of marriage be insufficient 
to account for the material change which has taken place in the 
birth-rate within the last few decades, it is clear that the latter 
must be attributable to the diminished fertility of those who are 
married. On this question the figures in the second portion of 
Table VI. throws some light. Here the annual number of 
legitimate births is shown in its proportion to the mean number 
of married women of conceptive age at each of the three latest 
enumerations. The rate, it will be seen, has fallen in all the 
countries specified, except for a slight increase of 2 % in Ireland 
and an almost stationary condition in Austria and Spain. The 
decline in Italy and Norway is small, but in France, where for a 
long time the fertility of the population has been very much 
below that of any other European country, the birth-rate thus 
calculated fell by nearly 20%, the same figure being approached 
in Belgium, where however, the fertility of married women is 
considerably greater. The case of England is remarkable. In 
the earlier period its crude birth and marriage-rates were above 
the average and its proportion of young wives well up to it. 
Its fertility-rate, however, which was by no means high in 1880, 
fell by nearly 18% by 1901, and since that date a further fall 
is reported by the registrar-general, to 24%, leaving the rate 
below that of all the other European countries except France. 
The States of Australasia, again, have experienced a decline 
even more marked. In 1880-1882 their fertility-rate ranged 
from 300 to 338, a low proportion for a new country, but nearly 
up to the European standard. By 1 900-1 902, however, the rate 
had fallen in all the larger States by from 23 to 31% and the 



POPULATION 



97 



highest rate recorded, 253 per thousand conceptive wives, was 
lower than that of any European country except France and 
Belgium. The cessation of assisted immigration early in the 
life of the present generation is alleged to have had considerable 
influence upon the rate, in Victoria, at least, owing to the curtail- 
ment of the supply of adult women of the more conceptive ages 
and the ageing of those who had reached the country at an 
earlier date. But neither this nor the diminution of the marriage- 
rate amongst women of those ages suffices to account for more 
than a fraction of the decline. The same tendency, moreover, 
is traceable in the New England States of America, so far as 
statistics are available. 

It has been held by some that a phenomenon so widely 
diffused over the western world must be attributable to physio- 
logical causes, such as alcoholism, syphilis, the abuse of narcotics 
and so on. Herbert Spencer, again, before the decline in 
question set in, put forward the hypothesis that " the ability to 
maintain individual life and the ability to multiply vary in- 
versely"; in other words, the strain upon the nervous system 
involved in the struggle for life under the conditions of modern 
civilization, by reacting on the reproductive powers, tends 
towards comparative sterility. These theories, however, being 
supported, according to the authorities of to-day, by no evidence, 
statistical or other, need not be here considered. 

Nor, again, can the decline in fertility be connected with 
any diminution of material prosperity. On the contrary, the 
fertility-rate appears to be best maintained in countries by no 
means distinguished for their high standard of living, such as 
Spain, Italy, Ireland, and, perhaps, Austria. In this respect 
Holland stands by itself; but in the others mentioned, with the 
exception of Ireland, both marriage and birth-rates are high 
and there has been a comparatively insignificant fall in prolifi- 
city. The decline has been greatest where the standard of 
comfort is notoriously high, as in the United States, England 
and Australasia; also in France, where the general wellbeing 
reaches probably a lower depth in the community than in any 
other part of Europe. The comparison of the rates in France 
with those of Ireland is an instructive illustration of the point 
under consideration. In France more than half the women 
of conceptive age are married: in Ireland less than a third, 
and the proportion of youthful wives in the latter is 28% below 
that in France. In both the crude birth-rate is far below that 
of any other European country. But the fertility of the Irish 
wife exceeded that of her French compeer by 44% in 1880 and 
by no less than 84% twenty years later. So steady, indeed, 
has been the prolificity of Ireland, that from being ninth on the 
list at the earlier period mentioned, it is now inferior only to 
Holland and perhaps Finland in this respect. 

It need not be assumed, however, that because these rates 
cannot be associated with the comparative degree of prosperity 
attained by the individual community they are altogether inde- 
pendent of the economic factors mainly contributing to that 
condition, such as trade, employment and prices. It is difficult, 
indeed, if not impracticable, to disentangle the effects which 
should be respectively attributed to influences so closely related 
to each other; but, of the three, prices alone tend to sufficient 
uniformity in their course in different countries to justify a 
supposition that they are in some way connected with a phenom- 
enon so widely diffused as that of the decline in marriage and 
fertility. It is not improbable, therefore, that the fall in whole- 
sale prices which, with temporary interruptions, persisted between 
1870 and 1900, in general harmony with the other movement, 
may have conduced to reluctance on the part of those who 
have enlarged their notions of the standard of comfort to en- 
danger their prospects of enjoying it by incurring the additional 
expenses of family life. Matrimony may be postponed, or, when 
entered upon, may be rendered a lighter burden upon the bread- 
winner. The economic element in the situation, which is 
imposed upon the individual by circumstances, is thus modified 
voluntarily into a moral or prudential consideration. In this 
case diminished prolificity where unaccompanied by a decrease 
in the number of marriages at reproductive ages, is attributable 
xxii. 4 



to the voluntary restriction of child-bearing on the part of the 
married. This explanation of the decline is supported by 
the almost Ainanimous opinion of the medical profession in the 
countries in question, and substantial evidence can be 
found everywhere of the extensive prevalence of the doctrine 
and practice of what has been termed, in further derogation of 
the repute of the " much misrepresented Malthus," Neotnal- 
thusianism. Preventive measures of this kind have long 
been in use in France, with the result shown in Tables V. 
and VI., and from that country they have spread, mostly since 
1870, nearly all over western Europe, as well as to the Anglo- 
Saxon world beyond the seas; but are scarcely apparent in 
countries where the Roman church has a strong hold on the 
people. It is generally held that the practice of thus limiting 
families usually prevails, in the first instance, among the better- 
off classes, and in time filters down, as " the gospel of comfort " 
is accepted by those of less resources, until the prolificity of the 
whole community is more or less affected by it. The registrar 
general for England, indeed, has stated that whilst no more than 
about 17% of the decline in the birth-rate can be attributed 
to abstinence or postponement of marriage, nearly 70% should 
be ascribed to voluntary restriction. 

The question of illegitimate births is the last to be here 
mentioned. It appears to be connected to a considerable extent 
with the subject dealt with above. In nearly every country the 
rate of these births has of late years shown a marked fall, which 
is by some ascribed to the adoption of the same expedients in 
illicit intercourse as are becoming conventional amongst the 
married. The rates given at the end of Table VI. are calculated 
upon the number of women most likely to produce them, that 
is, the spinsters, widows and divorced of conceptive age. In 
comparing the different countries, it may be noted that in some 
parts of Europe the rate is raised by the inclusion of the off- 
spring of marriages not registered as demanded by law, though 
duly performed in church. Then, again, the possibility of 
legitimization by subsequent marriage tends to raise the rate. 
Italy and Scotland may be taken as examples of these two 
influences, and in Germany, too, the rates in Saxony and Bavaria, 
which are among the highest in Europe, are in part due to the 
non-registration of marriages sanctioned by religious ceremony 
only. The low rates in Ireland, Holland and England are 
especially noticeable, and in the last named, the decrease 
between 1870 and 1905 amounted to more than 50%, not, 
however, entirely due, it is said, to improved morality. 

Deaths. — The forces tending towards the natural growth of 
population, which have been described above, differ from that 
which acts in the opposite direction in two material features. 
Marriage and child-bearing, in the first place, are operative 
amongst a fraction of the population only — those of conceptive 
age; whereas to the Urn of Death, as Dr Farr expressed it, all ages 
are called upon to contribute in their differing degrees. Then, 
again, the former are voluntary acts, entirely under the control 
of the individual; but mortality, though not beyond human 
regulation, is far less subject to it, and in order to have sub- 
stantial results the control must be the outcome of collective 
rather than individual co-operation. The course of the marriage 
and birth-rates, set forth above, affords evidence that the 
control over both has been exercised of recent years to an un- 
precedented extent, and it. will appear from what is stated 
below, that partly owing to this cause, partly, also, to improved 
hygienic conditions in western life, there has been an even more 
pronounced decline in the rate of mortality. The general 
results of both upon the natural increase of population in the 
countries selected for illustration of this subject will be found 
at the end of this paragraph. For the purpose of showing this, 
the crude death-rate, taken, like that of births, upon the whole 
population, without distinction of age or sex, will suffice. Where, 
however, the tendency to mortality, not its results, is in question, 
both the above factors must be taken into account, as they have 
been above in distinguishing the rate of fertility from that of 
births. The process of correcting the mere numbers of annual 
deaths per thousand of population into a form which renders

the return comparable with those for communities differently 
constituted is somewhat complicated, but it is amply justified 
by its necessity in adapting the figures to the important services 
they perform in actuarial and sanitary science. This subject 
can only be dealt with here in outline. In the first place, sex 
must be distinguished, because, from infancy upwards, except 
between the ages of 10 and 20, the mortality amongst females 
is considerably less than amongst the other sex, and appears, 
too, to be declining more rapidly. So far as adult life is con- 
cerned this superior vitality is no doubt attributable to com- 
parative immunity from the risks and hardships to which men 
are exposed, as, also, to the weaker inclination of women towards 
intemperance of different kinds. Thus, though the generally 
higher proportion of females in the community may seldom be 
enough to depress more than slightly the death-rate as a whole, 
it has a substantial effect upon it at the ages where women are in 
more marked numerical predominance, as in later life, and in 
places where the number of domestic servants is unusually 
great. Age is a factor still more important than sex in a return 
intended to serve as an index of mortality. The liability to 
death is extremely high amongst infants, decreasing with every 
month of life during the first year, but continuing above the 
mean rate until about the age of five. From the latter period 
until the fifteenth or sixteenth year vitality is at its best. 
The death-rate then gradually rises, slowly till 25, more rapidly 
later, when, from about 45 onward deterioration asserts itself 
more pronouncedly, and by three score years and ten the rate 
begins to exceed that of childhood. Thus, all other considera- 
tions being set aside, mortality tends to vary inversely with 
the proportion of the population at the healthy period 5 to 25. 
As the replenishment of this group depends upon the conditions 
prevailing at the earlier ages, it is to the mortality in childhood 
that most weight, from the standpoint of hygiene, must be 
attached. In most European countries not much less than half 
the annual deaths take place amongst children below five years 
of age, upon the total number of whom the incidence falls to the 
extent of from 40 to 120 per mille. The greater part of this is 
debitable, as just pointed out, to the first year, in which the 
mortality, calculated upon the number of births, ranged, in the 



decennium 1895-1904, between 70 per mille, in the exceptionally 
favourable circumstances of the Australasian States, to nearly 
270 in European Russia. It should be remarked, in passing, 
that these rates are enormously higher amongst illegitimate 
children than amongst those born in wedlock, and that the 
proportion of still-born amongst the former is also in excess of 
that amongst the latter by some 50%. Infantile mortality is 
higher, too, in urban tracts, especially those associated with 
manufacturing industries. In Table VII. below, in which the 
crude rate alone is dealt with, evidence will be found of the 
general decline which has taken place in the mortah'ty, thus 
expressed in different countries. 

The difference in the rates for the various countries must not 
be taken as a measure of difference in mortality, since, as accord- 
ing to the table, much of it is ascribable to difference in age- 
constitution. At the same time, where the range is very wide, 
as between the rates in Scandinavia and Australia, and those in 
southern and eastern Europe, the variation, to a great extent, 
cannot be accounted for otherwise than by difference in hygienic 
conditions, more especially in the light thrown by the figures 
of infantile mortality in the second part of the table. The 
variations from period to period in the same country are more 
instructive. They show that in the 35 years covered the death- 
rate has generally declined by over 20%. The exceptional 
cases are, first, Ireland and Norway, with their emigrating 
tendencies; then Spain, where the returns have probably to be 
discounted for improved registration, and France, where the 
population is all but stationary. In Finland the death-rate 
at the earlier period taken for the comparison was abnormally 
swollen by epidemic disease, and if it be set on one side the 
decline appears to have been in harmony with that in its Scan- 
dinavian neighbours. The decline in mortality has been much 
greater than that in the crude birth-rate everywhere except in 
France, Australia, and, of course, Ireland; and it is only in the 
two former that it has been exceeded by that in the fertility- 
rate. The standard mortality of each community is deduced 
from a life-table, representing a "generation " of people assumed 
to be born at the same moment and followed throughout their 
hypothetical life, in the light of the distribution by age ascertained

through the census and the number of deaths at each age 
observed for as many years, generally from 10 to 20, as suffice 
to furnish a trustworthy average. The population thus dealt 
with is supposed to be stationary, that is, the loss by death at 
each age is at once made good by the addition of an equal 
number of the same age, whilst the survivors pass on to the 
age above. Of the many calculations set forth in these valuable 
tables there is only room here to refer to the " afterlifetimc " 
for such countries as it is available, which is quoted in the last 
column of Table VII. It shows the average number of years 
which persons of a given age, or, as here, of all ages, will live, 
on the assumption that they are subject to the calculated 
probabilities of survival. It is sometimes known as the 
" expectation of life," a term, however, which involves a 
mathematical hypothesis now discarded. 

The relation between the birth and the death rates has been 
the subject of much analysis and controversy. Observation has 
demonstrated that the two rates are generally found to move 
along parallel lines. A high birth-rate is accompanied by high 
mortality; conversely, when one is low, so is the other. A birth- 
rate continuously in excess of the death-rate tends to lower the 
latter through the supply it affords of people annually reaching 
the more healthy ages. If the supply be diminished, the narrower 
field open to the risks of infancy has the immediate effect of 
further decreasing the mortality. In course of time, however,

under the same influence, those passing from their prime into 
the second period of danger acquire a numerical preponderance 
which throws its weight upon the general death-rate and tends 
to raise it. It is assumed that throughout the above course the 
hygienic conditions of life remain unchanged". If, however, they 
undergo marked improvement, the duration of life is extended 
and both birth and death-rates, being spread over a wider 
field of the living, tend to decrease. On the other hand, an 
accidental set-back to population, such as that caused by famine 
or a disastrous war, leaves room which an increasing birth-rate 
hastens to occupy. A similar result follows in a lesser degree 
a wave of emigration. Examples of all the above tendencies 
may be gleaned from the returns of the countries named in the 
table, though space does not admit of their exhibtion. In 
both France and Germany, for instance, the process of replenish- 
ment after a great war can be traced both early and late in the 



19th century. In England, the decrease in " natality " is in 
itself enough to account for the decline in the death-rate, apart 
from any considerations of improved hygiene. In France, on 
the contrary, the low natality having been so long continued, 
has raised the death-rate, by reason of the balance of propor- 
tion having been shifted by it from youth and the prime of life 
to old age. It may be inferred from the above that a high birth- 
rate does not imply a high rate of increase of population, any 
more than docs a decreasing mortality, but the two rates must 
be considered in their relations to each other. The death-rate, 
however, is often taken by itself as the measure of the relatively 
favourable conditions or otherwise of the* different countries; 
but it indicates at best the maintaining power of the community, 
whereas the increasing power, as manifested in the birth-rate, 
has also to be taken into account. Here, again, it is not sufficient 
to rely upon the mere rate of natural growth, or the difference 
between the two rates, since this may be the same in a community 
where both the rates are very high as in one where they are 
relatively low, a distinction of considerable importance. It has 
been suggested by Dr Rubin of Copenhagen, that if the death 
rate (d) be squared and divided by the birth-rate (6), due influence 
is allowed to each rate respectively, as well as to the difference 
in the height of the rates in different countries (Journ. R. 
Statist. Soc, London, 1897, p. 154). The quotient thus obtained 
decreases as the conditions are more favourable, and, on the 
whole, it seems to form a good index to the merit of 
the respective countries from the standpoint of vital 
forces. The first column of Table VIII. shows the 
order in which the countries mentioned are found to 
stand according to the above test. 

The three Australasian states head the list in virtue 
of their remarkably low death-rate, which outweighs 
the relative paucity of their births. The next countries 
in order all belong to north-western Europe, and their 
index-quotients are all very close to each other. 
Sweden falls below its geographical neighbours owing 
to its low birth-rate, and Finland because of its higher 
mortality. England and Scotland, in spite of their 
higher birth-rates, are kept below Scandinavia by the 
higher death-rate, but their birth-rate places them 
above Belgium. Ireland and France are pulled down 
by their low natality. The latter, with the same 
mortality as Germany, stands far below it for the 
above reason, as Ireland is raised by its lower death- 
rate above the prolific countries of eastern Europe. 
The rate of natural growth is given in the second part 
of the table. In the case of two of the Australasian 
states, of Holland, Finland, Spain and Italy, the 
order is in accord with that given by the test applied 
above, and the difference between the two in Austria, 
Ireland and France is not large. The great difference 
between the serial rank occupied in the respective lists 
by Russia, .Servia and Galicia, with remarkably high 
rates of natural growth, as well as that found in the 
case of most of the other countries in question, shows 
that this factor is by no means a trustworthy guide in 
the estimate of hygienic balance. 
Migration. — Passing from the internal factors in the move- 
ment of population, the influence has to be taken into account 
of the interchange of population between different countries. 
The net results of such exchange can be roughly estimated by 
comparing the rate of natural growth with that of the total 
increase of the community between one census and another, 
as set forth in Table VIII., in the last section of which the approxi- 
mate loss by emigration, as calculated by Dr SundbSrg, is given. 
It will be seen that the only European country which gains by 
the exchange is France, and there the accretion is almost insig- 
nificant. Between many of the countries there is a good deal 
of migration which is only seasonal or temporary, according to 
the demand for labour. From Russia, too, there is a stream of 
colonization across the Urals into western Siberia, and amongst 
the western Mediterranean populations there is constant

migration to North Africa • The greatest drain from Europe, 
however, has been across the sea to the United States, Canada 
and Australasia, especially to the first-named. Dr Sundbarg's 
returns give about 28 millions as the number which left Europe 
'by sea during the 19th century, of whom all but 4 millions 
emigrated during the last half of that period. Between 1821 
and 1904, about 22 millions landed from Europe in the United 
States; about 2J millions in Canada; 2 millions in Australia, 
besides a good number in Brazil, the Argentine and South 
Africa. The return of birthplace which usually forms part of 
the census inquiry, affords supplementary information on the 
subject of immigration. In Canada, for instance, those born 
abroad numbered 17 % of the population in 1871, and about 
13 % thirty years later. In New South Wales, the correspond- 
ing figures were 41 and 28 %, and in Victoria 55 and 27. In New 
Zealand the consequences of the cessation of special encourage- 
ment to emigration were still more marked, the foreign-born 
declining in proportion from 63 to $3 %. On the other hand, 
in the United States, from 97 % in 1850 the proportion rose to 
13-7 in 1900, and has since reached still higher figures, as has 
been the case recently in Canada also. Up to the early 'nineties 
the greater part of the immigrants into America were furnished 
by Germany, Ireland and Great Britain, but for the next fifteen 
years the place of those countries was taken by Italy and eastern 
Europe. The general results of the two movements in Europe 
have been thus summarised by Dr Sundbarg: —

but the figures suffice to show the contrast between the early 
part of the century and the period following the great migratory 
movements to the new goldfields. In the countries receiving 
the stream of newcomers, the intercensal rate of increase was 
obviously very different from those of the older countries, though 
it seems to have largely spent itself or been counteracted by 
other influences. The latest rates, for instance, were only 18 
per mille per annum in Australia; 11 in Canada and 19 in the 
United States.

POPULONIUM (Etruscan Pupluna), an ancient seaport town 
of Etruria, Italy, at the north end of the peninsular' of Monte 
Massoncello, at the south end of which is situated the town 
of Piombino (q.v.). The place, almost the only Etruscan town 



built directly on the sea, was situated on a lofty hill 1 now 
crowned by a conspicuous medieval castle and a poor modern 
village (Populonia). Considerable remains of its town walls, 
of large irregular, roughly rectangular blocks (the form is that 
of the natural splitting of the schistose sandstone), still exist, 
enclosing a circuit of about ij m. The remains existing within 
them are entirely Romania row of vaulted substructions, a 
water reservoir and a mosaic with representations of fishes. 
Strabo mentions the existence here of a look-out tower for the 
shoals of tunny-fish. There are some tombs outside the town, 
some of which, ranging from the Villanova period (9th century 
B.C.) to the middle of the 3rd century B.C., were explored in 
1908. In one, a large circular tomb, were found three sepulchral 
couches in stone, carved in imitation of wood, and a fine 
statuette in bronze of Ajax committing suicide. Close by was 
found a horse collar with 14 bronze bells. The remains of a 
temple, devastated in ancient times (possibly by Dionysius 
of Syracuse in 384 B.C.), were also discovered, with fragments of 
Attic vases of the 5th century B.C., which had served as ex 
votos in it. Coins of the town have also been found in silver 
and copper. The iron mines of Elba, and the tin and copper 
of s the mainland, were owned and smelted by the people of 
Populonia; hot springs too lay some 6 m. to the E. (Aquae 
Populaniae) on the high road — Via Aurelia — along the coast. 
At this point a road branched off to Saena (Siena). According 
to Virgil the town sent a contingent to the help of Aeneas, and 
it furnished Scipio with iron in 205 B.C. It 
offered considerable resistance to Sulla, who 
took it by siege; and from this dates its 
decline, which Strabo, who describes it well 
(v. 2, 6, p. 223), already notes as beginning, 
while four centuries later Rutilius describes 
it as in ruins. The harbour, however, 
continued to be of some importance, and 
the place was still an episcopal see in the 
time of Gregory the Great.

PORBANDAR, a native state of India, 
in the Kathiawar political agency, Bombay, 
extending along the S.W. coast of the 
peninsula of Kathiawar. Area, £36 sq. m.; 
pop. (1901), 82,640, showing a decrease of 4 % in the decade. 
Estimated gross revenue, £65,000; tribute, £3,233. The chief, 
whose title is rana, is a Jethwa Rajput. Limestone is largely 
exported to Bombay. This limestone is used for buildings in 
Porbandar without mortar, and is said to coalesce into a solid 
block under the influence of moisture. The town of Porbandar 
is the maritime terminus of the Kathiawar railway system. Pop. 
(1901), 24,620. A large trade is conducted in native boats as far 
as the east coast of Africa. 

PORCELAIN, the name of that kind of ceramic' ware which is 
characterized by a translucent body, also loosely used for the 
finer kinds of ware generally, popularly known as " china " 
(see Ceramics). The French porcelaine, from which the word 
comes into English, is an adaptation of the Italian porcellana, 
a cowrie-shell, the beautifully polished surface of which caused 
the name to be applied to the ware. The Italian word is generally 
taken to be from pqrceUa, diminutive of porco, pig, from a sup- 
posed resemblance of the shell to a pig's back. 

PORCH (through the Fr. porche, from Lat. portlcus; the 
Ital. equivalent is portico, corresponding to the Gr. vapdrj^ 
Ger. Vorhalle), a covered erection forming a shelter to the 
entrance door of a large building. The earliest known are the 
two porches of the Tower of the Winds at Athens; there would 
seem to have been one in front of the entrance door of the villa 
of Diomede outside the gate at Pompeii; in Rome they were

not Sardinia, as Strabo (and following him, Lord Macau lay) erro- 
neously state.

probably not allowed, but on either side of the entrance door of 
a mansion, porticoes set back behind the line of frontage were 
provided, according to F. Mazois, as shelters from sun and rain 
for those who paid early visits before the doors were opened. 
In front of the early Christian basilicas was a long arcaded porch 
called " narthex " (q.v.) In later times porches assume two 
forms — one the projecting erection covering the entrance at 
the west front of cathedrals, and divided into three or more 
doorways, &o, and the other a kind of covered chamber open 
at the ends, and having small windows at the sides as a protection 
from rain. These generally stand on the north or south sides 
of churches, though in Kent there are a few instances (as Snodland 
and Boxley) where they are at the west ends. Those of the Nor- 
man period generally have little projection, and are sometimes 
so flat as to be little more than outer dressings and hood- 
moulds to the inner door. They are often richly ornamented, 
and, as at Southwell in England and Kelso in Scotland, have 
rooms over, which have been erroneously called parvises. Early 
English porches are much longer, and in larger buildings fre- 
quently have rooms above; the gables are generally bold and high 
pitched. In larger buildings also, as at Wells, St Albans, &c, 
the interiors are as rich in design as the exteriors. Decorated 
and Perpendicular porches partake of much the same character- 
istics, the pitch of roof, mouldings, copings, battlements, &c, 
being, of course, influenced by the taste of the time. The later 
porches have rooms over them more frequently than in earlier 
times; these are often approached from the lower storey by small 
winding stairs, and sometimes have fire-places, and are supposed 
to have served as vestries; and sometimes there are the remains 
of a piscina, and relics of altars, as if they had been used as 
chantry chapels. It is probable there were wooden porches at 
all periods, particularly in those places where stone was scarce; 
but, as may be expected from their exposed position, the earliest 
have decayed. At Cobham, Surrey, there was one that had 
ranges of semicircular arches in oak at the sides, of strong 
Norman character. It is said there are several in which portions 
of Early English work are traceable, as at Chevington in Suffolk. 
In the Decorated and later periods, however, wooden porches 
are common, some plain, others with rich tracery and large 
boards; these frequently stand on a sort of half storey of stone 
work or bahut. The entrance porches at the west end of cathe- 
drals are generally called portals, and where they assume the 
character of separate buildings, are designated galilees; e.g. the 
porticoes on the west side of the south transept of Lincoln 
Cathedral, and at the west end of the nave of Ely Cathedral, and 
the chapel at the west end of Durham Cathedral. The finest 
example in England of an open projected porch is that of 
Peterborough Cathedral, attached to the Early Norman nave. 

The term " porch " is also given to the magnificent portals 
of the French cathedrals, where the doors are so deeply recessed 
as to become porches, such as those of Reims, Amiens, Chartres, 
Troyes, Rouen, Bourges, Paris, and Beauvais cathedrals, 
St Ouen, Rouen, and earlier Romanesque churches, as in St 
Trophime, Aries and St Gilles. Many, however, have detached 
porches in front of the portals, as in Notre Dame at Avigon, 
Chartres (north and south), Noyon, Bourges (north and south), 
St Vincent at Rouen, Notre Dame de Louviers, the cathedrals 
of Albi and Le Puy, and in Germany those of Spires and Regens- 
burg, and the churches of St Laurence and St Sebald at 
Nuremberg. (R. P. S.) 

PORCUPINE (Fr., porc-tpic, "spiny pig "), the name of 
the largest European representative of the terrestrial rodent 
mammals, distinguished by the spiny covering from which it 
takes its name. The European porcupine (Hystrix cristata) is 
the typical representative of a family of Old World rodents, the 
Hystricidae, all the members of which have the same protective 
covering. These rodents are characterized by the imperfectly 
rooted cheek-teeth, imperfect clavicles or collar-bones, cleft 
upper lip, rudimentary first front-toes, smooth soles, six teats 
and many cranial characters. They range over the south of 
Europe, the whole of Africa, India and the Malay Archipelago 
as far east as Borneo. They are all stout, heavily-built animals, 



with blunt rounded heads, fleshy mobile snouts, and coats of 
thick cylindrical or flattened spines, which form the whole 
covering of their body, and arc not intermingled with ordinary 
hairs. Their habits are strictly terrestrial. Of the three genera 
Hystrix is characterized by the inflated skull, in which the nasal 
chamber is often considerably larger than the brain-case, and 




The Porcupine (Hystrix cristata). 
the short tail, tipped with numerous slender-stalked open quills, 
which make a loud rattling noise whenever the animal moves. 
The common porcupine (H. cristata), which occurs throughout 
the south of Europe and North and West Africa, is replaced in 
South Africa by H. africaeaustralis and in India by the hairy- 
nosed porcupine (H. leucura). 

Besides these large crested species, there are several smaller species 
without crests in north-east India, and the Malay region from Nepal 
to Borneo. The genus Atherura includes the brush-tailed porcupines 
which are much smaller animals, with long tails tipped with bundles 
of flattened spines. Two species are found in the Malay region and 
one in West Africa. Tricnys, the last genus, contains two species, 
T, fasciculata of Borneo and T. macrotis of Sumatra, both externally 
very like , Atherura, but differing from the members of that genus 
in many cranial characteristics. In the New World the porcupines 
are represented by the members of the family Erethizontidae t or 
Coendtdae, which have rooted molars, complete collar-bones, entire 
upper lips, tuberculated soles, no trace of a first front -toe, and four 
teats. The spines are mixed with long soft hairs. They are less 
strictly nocturnal in their habits; and with one exception live 
entirely in trees, having in correspondence with this long and power- 
ful prehensile tails. They include three genera, of which tne first 
is represented by the Canadian porcupine (Erethizon dorsatus), 
a stout, heavily-built animal, with long hairs almost or quite hiding 
its spines, four front- and five hind-toes, and a short, stumpy tail. It 
is a native of the greater part of Canada and the United States, 
wherever there is any remnant of the original forest left. Syneiheres, 
or Cotndu, contains some eight or ten species, known as tree-porcu- 
pines, found throughout tropical South America, with one extending 
into Mexico. They are of a lighter build than the grou nd- porcupines, 
with short, close, many-coloured spines, often mixed with hairs, 
and prehensile tails. The hind-feet have only four toes, owing to 
the suppression of the first, in place of which they have a fleshy 
pad on the inner side of the foot, between which and the toes boughs 
and other objects can be firmly grasped as with a hand. Chaetomys, 
distinguished by the shape of its skull and the greater complexity 
of its teeth, contains C. subspinosus, a native of the hottest parts 
of Brazil. (W. H. F.; R. L.*) 

PORDENONE, IL (1483-1539), an eminent painter of the Vene- 
tian school, whose correct name was Giovanni Antonio Licinio, 
or Licino. He was commonly named II Pordenone from having 
been born in 1483 at Corticelli, a village near Pordenone (q.v.) 
in Italy. He ultimately dropped the name of Licinio, having 
quarrelled with his brothers, one of whom had wounded him in 
the hand; he then called himself Regillo, or De Regillo. His 
signature runs " Antonius Portunaensis," er " De Portunaonis." 
He was created a cavaliere by Charles V. 

As a painter Licinio was a scholar of Pellegrino da S. Daniele, 
but the leading influence which governed his style was that of 
Giorgione; the popular story that he was a fellow-pupil with 
Titian under Giovanni Bellini is incorrect. The district

PORDENONE— PORISM 






about Pordenone had been somewhat fertile in capable 
painters; but Licinio excelled them all in invention and design, 
and more especially in the powers of a vigorous chiaroscurist 
and flesh painter. Indeed, so far as mere flesh-painting is 
concerned he was barely inferior to Titian in breadth, pulpiness 
and tone; and he was for a while the rival of that great painter 
in public regard. The two were open enemies, and Licinio 
would sometimes affect to wear arms while he was painting. 
He excelled Giorgione in light and shade and in the effect of 
relief, and was distinguished in perspective and in portraits; 
he was equally at home in fresco and in oil-colour. He executed 
many works in Pordenone and elsewhere in Friuli, and in Cremona 
and Venice; at one time he settled in Piacenza, where is one of 
his most celebrated church pictures, " St Catherine disputing with 
the Doctors in Alexandria "; the figure of St Paul in connexion 
with this picture is his own portrait. He was formally invited 
by Duke Hercules II. of Ferrara to that court; here soon after- 
wards, in 1539, he died, not without suspicion of poison. His 
latest works are comparatively careless and superficial; and 
generally he is better in male figures than in female — the latter 
being somewhat too sturdy — and the composition of his subject- 
pictures is scarcely on a level with their other merits. Pordenone 
appears to have been a vehement self-asserting man, to which 
his style as a painter corresponds, and his morals were not 
unexceptionable. Three of his principal scholars were Bernar- 
dino Licinio, named II Sacchiense, his son-in-law Pomponio 
Amalteo, and Giovanni Maria Calderari. 

The following may be named among Pordenone's works: 
the picture of " S Luigi Giustiniani and other Saints," originally 
in S Maria dell' Orto, Venice; a " Madonna and Saints " (both 
of these in the Venice academy); the " Woman taken in Adul- 
tery," in the Berlin museum; the " Annunciation," at Udine, 
regarded by Vasari as the artist's masterpiece, now damaged by 
restoration. In Hampton Court is a duplicate work, the 
" Painter and his Family "; and in Burghley House are two fine 
pictures now assigned to Pordenone — the " Finding of Moses " 
and the " Adoration of the Kings." These used to be attributed 
to Titian and to Bassano respectively. 

PORDENONE, a town of the province of Udine, Venetia, 
Italy, 30 m. W. by S. of Udine on the railway to Treviso. Pop. 
(1001), 8425 (town); 12,409 (commune). It was the birthplace 
of the painter generally known as II Pordenone {q.v.). Paintings 
from his brush adorn the cathedral (which has a fine brick 
campanile), and others are preserved in the gallery of the town 
hall. Cotton industries are active, and silk and pottery are 
manufactured. 

PORE, a small opening or orifice, particularly used of the open- 
ings of the ducts of the sweat-glands in the skin or of the stomata 
in the epidermis of plants or those through which the pollen 
or seed are discharged from anthers or seed capsules. The 
word is an adaptation through the French from Lat. porus, 
Gr. iropos, passage. In the sense of to look closely at, to read 
with persistent or close attention, " pore " is of obscure origin. 
It would seem to be connected with " peer," to look closely 
into, and would point to an O. Eng. purian or pyrian. There 
is no similar word in Old French. 

PORFIRIUS, PUBLILIUS OPTATIANUS, Latin poet, possibly 
a native of Africa, flourished during the 4th century a.d. He 
has been identified with Publilius Optatianus, who was prae- 
fectus urbi (329 and 333)^ and is by some authorities included 
amongst the Christian poets. For some reason he had been 
banished, but having addressed a panegyric to the Emperor 
Constantine the Great, he was allowed to return. Twenty- 
eight poems are extant under his name, of which twenty were 
included in the panegyric. They have no value except as 
curiosities and specimens of perverted ingenuity. Some of 
them are squares (the number of letters in each line being equal), 
certain letters being rubricated so as to form a pattern or figure, 
and at the same time special verses or maxims; others represent 
various objects (a syrinx, an organ, an altar); others have 
special peculiarities in each line (number of words or letters) ; 
while the 28th poem (the versus anacyclici) may be read back- 



wards without any effect upon sense or metre. A complimentary 
letter from the emperor and letter of thanks from the author are 
also extant. The best edition of the poem is by L. Miiller (1877).

PORISM. The subject of porisms is perplexed hy the 
multitude of different views which have been held by geometers 
as to what a porism really was and is. The treatise which has 
given rise to the controversies on this subject is the Porisms of 
Euclid, the author of the Elements. For as much as we know 
of this lost treatise we are indebted to the Collection of Pappus 
of Alexandria, who mentions it along with other geometrical 
treatises, and gives a number of lemmas necessary for under- 
standing It. Pappus states that the porisms of Euclid are 
neither theorems nor problems, but are in some sort intermediate, 
so that they may be presented either as theorems or as problems; 
and they were regarded accordingly by many geometers, who 
looked merely at the form of the enunciation, as being actually 
theorems or problems, though the definitions given by the 
older writers showed that they better understood the distinction 
between the three classes of propositions. The older geometers 
regarded a theorem as directed to proving what is proposed, 
a problem as directed to constructing what is proposed, and 
finally a porism as directed to finding what is proposed (etj 
•Kopiaixbv avrov tov irpoTtwofikvov) . Pappus goes on to say that 
this last definition was changed by certain later geometers, who 
defined a porism on the ground of an accidental characteristic 
as rd \eiirov virodecret roirucdv ^ccopij/xaros, that which falls short 
of a locus-theorem by a (or in its) hypothesis. 

Proclus points out that the word was used in two senses. 
One sense is that of " corollary," as a result unsought, as it were, 
but seen to follow from a theorem. On the " porism " in the 
other sense he adds nothing to the definition of " the older 
geometers " except to say (what does not really help) that 
the finding of the center of a circle and the finding of the 
greatest common measure are porisms (Proclus, ed. Friedlein, 
p. 301). 

Pappus gives a complete enunciation of a porism derived 
from Euclid, and an extension of it to a more general case. 
This porism, expressed in modern language, asserts that — given 
four straight lines of -which three turn about the points in which 
they meet the fourth, if two of the points of intersection of these 
lines lie each on a fixed straight line, the remaining point of inter- 
section will also lie on another straight line. The general enuncia- 
tion applies to any number of straight lines, say (w+i), of which 
n can turn about as many points fixed on the (w+i)tb. These n 
straight lines cut, two and two, in %n{n-i) points, J«(«-i) 
being a triangular number whose side is (»-i). If, then, they 
are made to turn about the n fixed points so that any («-i) of 
their \n {n-i) points of intersection, chosen subject to a certain 
limitation, lie on {n-i) given fixed straight lines, then each of 
the remaining points of intersection, \ {n-i) {n-2) in number, 
describes a straight line. Pappus gives also a complete enuncia- 
tion of one porism of the first book of Euclid's treatise. This 
may be expressed thus: If about two fixed points P, Q we make 
turn two straight lines meeting on a given straight line L, and 
if one of them cut off a segment AM from a fixed straight line AX, 
given in position, we can determine another fixed straight line 
BY, and a point B fixed on it, such that the segment BM' made by 
the second moving line on this second fixed line measured from 
B has a given ratio X to the first segment AM. The rest of the 
enunciations given by Pappus are incomplete, and he merely 
says that he gives thirty-eight lemmas for the three books of 
porisms; and these include 171 theorems. 

The lemmas which Pappus gives in connexion with the 
porisms are interesting historically, because he gives (1) the 
fundamental theorem that the cross or an harmonic ratio of a 
pencil of four straight lines meeting in a point is constant for all 
transversals; (2) the proof of the harmonic properties of a com- 
plete quadrilateral; (3) the theorem that, if the six vertices of a 
hexagon lie three and three on two straight lines, the three points 
of concourse of opposite sides lie on a straight line. 



POROS— PORPHYRY 



103 



During the last three centuries this subject seems to have had 
great fascination for mathematicians, and many geometers have 
attempted to restore the lost porisms. Thus Albert Girard says in 
his Traith de trigonometric (1626) that he hopes to publish a restora- 
tion. About the same time P. de Fermat wrote a short work under 
the title Porismatum cudidaeorum renovate doctrina et sub forma 
isagoges recentioribus geometris exhibita (see Oeuvres de Fermat ', u, 
Paris, 1891); but two at least of the five examples of porisms which 
he gives do not fall within the classes indicated by Pappus. Robert 
Simson was the first to throw real light upon the subject. He first 
succeeded in explaining the only three propositions which Pappus 
indicates with any completeness. This explanation was published 
in the Philosophical Transactions in 1723. Later he investigated 
the subject of porisms generally in a work entitled De porismatibus 
tractatus; quo aoctrinam porismatum satis explicatam t et in posterum 
ab oblivione tutam fore sperat auctor, and published after his death 
in a volume, Roberti Simson opera quaedam reliqua (Glasgow, 1776). 
Simson's treatise, De porismatibus, begins with definitions of theorem, 
problem, datum, ponsm and focus. Respecting the porism Simson 
says that Pappus's definition is too general, and therefore he will 
substitute for it the following: " Porisma est propositio in qua 
proponitur demonstrare rem aliquam vel plures datas esse, cui vel 
quibus, ut et cuilibet ex rebus innumeris non quidem datis, sed 
quae ad ea quae data sunt eandem habent relationem, convenire 
ostendendum estaffectionem quandam communem in propositione 
descriptam. Porisma etiam in forma problematis enuntiari potest, 
si nimirum ex quibus data demonstranda sunt, invenienda proponan- 
tur." A locus (says Simson) is a species of porism. Then follows 
a Latin translation of Pappus's note on the porisms, and the proposi- 
tions which form the bulk of the treatise. These are Pappus's 
thirty-eight lemmas relating to the porisms, ten cases of the proposi- 
tion concerning four straight lines, twenty-nine porisms, two pro- 
blems in illustration and some preliminary lemmas. John Play- 
fair's memoir (Trans. Roy, Soc. Eain., 1794, vol. iii.), a sort of sequel 
to Simson's treatise, had for its special object the inquiry into the 
probable origin of porisms — that is, into the steps which led the 
ancient geometers to the discovery of them. Playfair remarked that 
the careful investigation of all possible particular cases of a proposi- 
tion would show that (1) under certain conditions a problem becomes 
impossible; (2) under certain other conditions, indeterminate or 
capable of an infinite number of solutions. These cases could be 
enunciated separately, were in a manner intermediate between 
theorems and problems, and were called " porisms." Playfair 
accordingly denned a porism thus: "A proposition affirming the 
possibility of finding such conditions as will render a certain problem 
indeterminate or capable of innumerable solutions." Though this 
definition of a porism appears to be most favoured in England, 
Simson's view has been most generally accepted abroad, and has 
the support of the great authority of Michael Chasles. However, 
in LiouvilWs Journal de mathSmatiques pures et appliquees (vol. xx., 
July, 1855), P. Breton published Recherches nouvelles sur les porismes 
d'Euclide, in which he gave a new translation of the text of Pappus, 
and sought to base thereon a view of the nature of a porism more 
closely conforming to the definitions in Pappus. This was followed 
in the same journal and in La Science by a controversy between 
Breton and A. J. H. Vincent, who disputed the interpretation given 
by the former of the text of Pappus, and declared himself in favour 
of the idea of Schooten, put forward in his Mathematical exercita- 
tiones (1657), in which he gives the name of "porism" to one section. 
According to F. van Schooten, if the various relations between 
straight lines in a figure are written down in the form of equations 
or proportions, then the combination of these equations in all possible 
ways, and of new equations thus derived from them leads to the 
discovery of innumerable new properties of the figure, and here 
we have " porisms." The discussions, however, between Breton 
and Vincent, in which C. Housel also joined, did not carry forward 
the work of restoring Euclid's Porisms, which was left for Chasles. 
His work (Les Trois livres de porismes d'Euclidc, Paris, t86o) makes 
full use of all the material found in Pappus. But we may doubt its 
being a successful reproduction of Euclid's actual work. Thus, in 
view of the ancillary relation in which Pappus's lemmas generally 
stand to the works to which they refer, it seems incredible that the 
first seven out of thirty-eight lemmas should be really equivalent 
(as Chasles makes them) to Euclid's first seven Porisms. Again, 
Chasles seems to have been wrong in making the ten cases of the 
four-line Porism begin the book, instead of the intercept-Porism 
fully enunciated _ by Pappus, to which the " lemma to the first 
Porism " relates intelligibly, being a particular case of it. An inter- 
esting hypothesis as to the Porisms was put forward by H. G. 
Zeuthen (Die Lehre von den Kegelschnitten im Alter turn, 1886, ch. viii.). 
Observing, e.g., that the intercept-Porism is still true if the two 
fixed points are points on a conic, and the straight lines drawn 
through them intersect on the conic instead of on a fixed straight 
line, Zeuthen conjectures that the Porisms were a by-product of a 
fully developed projective geometry of conies. It is a fact that 
Lemma 31 (though it makes no mention of a conic) corresponds 
exactly to Apollonius's method of determining the foci of a central 
conic (Conies, iii. 45-47 with ±2). 

The three porisms stated by Diophantus in his Aritkmetica are 



propositions in the theory of numbers which can all be enunciated 
in the form " we can jina numbers satisfying such and such condi- 
tions "; they are sufficiently analogous therefore to the geometrical 
porism as defined in Pappus and Procius. 

A valuable chapter on porisms (from a philological standpoint) 
is included in J. L. Heiberg's Litter argeschichtliche Studien uber 
Euklid (Leipzig, 1882); and the following books or tracts may also 
be mentioned: Aug. Richter, Porismen nack Simson bearbeitet 
(Elbing, 1837); M. Cantor, " Ueber die Porismen des Euklid und 
deren Divinatoren," in SchlomilcKs Zeitsch.f. Math. w. Phy. (1857), 
and Liter aturzeitung (1861), p. 3 scq. ; Th. Leidenfrost, Die Porismen 
des Euklid (Programm der Realschule zu Weimar, 1863); Fr. Buch- 
binder, Euclids Porismen und Data (Programm der kgl. Landesschule 
Pforta, 1866). (T. L. H.) 

POROS, or Poro (" the Ford ")i an island off the east coast of 
the Morea, separated at its western extremity by only a narrow 
channel from the mainland at Troezen, and consisting of a mass 
of limestone rock and of a mass of trachyte connected by a slight 
sandy isthmus. The town looks down on the beautiful harbour 
between the island and the mainland on the south. 

The ancient Calauria, with which Poros is identified, was given, 
according to the myth, by Apollo to Poseidon in exchange for 
Delos; and it became in historic times famous for a temple of the 
sea-god, which formed the centre of an amphictyony of seven 
maritime states — Hermione, Epidaurus, Aegina, Athens, Prasiae, 
Nauplia, and Orchomenus. Here Demosthenes took sanctuary 
with " gracious Poseidon," and, when this threatened to fail 
him, sought death. The building was of Doric architecture and 
lay on a ridge of the hill commanding a fine view of Athens and 
the Saronic Gulf, near the middle of the limestone part of the 
island. The site was excavated in 1894, and traces of a sacred 
agora with porticoes and other buildings, as well as the temple, 
have been found. In the neighbourhood of Poros-Calauria 
are two small islands, the more westerly of which contains the 
ruins of a small temple, and is probably the ancient Sphaeria or 
Hiera mentioned by Pausanias as the seat of a temple of Athena 
Apaturia. The English, French, and Russian plenipotentiaries 
met at Poros in 1828 to discuss the basis of the Greek government.

PORPHYRIO, POMPONIUS, Latin grammarian and com- 
mentator on Horace, possibly a native of Africa, flourished 
during the 2nd century a.d. (according to others, much later). 
His scholia on Horace, which are still extant, mainly consist of 
rhetorical and grammatical explanations. It is not probable 
that we possess the original work, which must have suffered 
from alterations and interpolations at the hands of the copyists 
of the middle ages, but on the whole the scholia form a valuable 
aid to the student of Horace.

PORPHYRY (IIop<£upio$) (a.d. 233-c. 304), Greek scholar, 
historian, and Neoplatonist, was born at Tyre, or Batanaea in 
Syria. He studied grammar and rhetoric under Cassius Long- 
inus (q.v.). His original name was Malchus (king), which was 
changed by his tutor into Porphyrius (clad in purple), a 
jesting allusion to the colour of the imperial robes (cf. porphyrc- 
genitus, born in the purple). In 262 he went to Rome, 
attracted by the reputation of Plotinus, and for six years 
devoted himself to the study of Neoplatonism. Having injured 
his health by overwork, he went to live in Sicily for five years. 
On his return to Rome, he lectured on philosophy and endea- 
voured to render the obscure doctrines of Plotinus (who had died 
tn the meantime) intelligible to the ordinary understanding. 
His most distinguished pupil was Iamblichus. When advanced 
in years he married Marcella, a widow with seven children and 
an enthusiastic student of philosophy. Nothing more is known 
of his life, and the date of his death is uncertain. 

Of his numerous works on a great variety of subjects the following 
are extant: Life of Plotinus and an exposition of his teaching in the

'Afapnal *p6s ra votjtSl (Sententiae ad intelligibilia ducentes, Aids 
to the study of the Intelligibles). The Life of Pythagoras, which is 
incomplete, probably formed part of a larger history of philosophy 
(<f>i\6a<xf>oi laropia, in four books) down to Plato. His work on 
Aristotle is represented by . the Introduction (ela ay oyyrj) to and 
Commentary (ktrryrjais, in the form of questions and answers) on 
the Categories. The first, translated into Latin by Boetius, was 
extensively used in the middle ages as a compendium of Aristotelian 
logic; of the second only fragments have been preserved. His 
Xpovuca, a chronological work, extended from the taking of Troy down 
to a.d. 270; to it Eusebius is indebted for his list of the Macedonian 
kings. The treatise #1X6X070$ laropta is called an aKp6aai$ 
(lecture) by Eusebius, who in his Praeparatio evangelica (x. 3) 
has preserved a considerable extract from it, treating of plagiarism 
amongst the ancients. Other grammatical and literary works are 
*OMptxa fyrrinaTa (Quaestiones homericae); and De antro nymph- 
arum, in which the description in the Odyssey (xiii. 102-112) is 
explained as an allegory of the universe. The IIcpl k-Koxfc kivpbxw 
(De abstinentia), on abstinence from animal food, is especially 
valuable as having preserved numerous original statements of the 
old philosophers and the substance of Theophrastus's Uepl efoe&eias 
(On Piety). It also contains a long fragment from the Cretans 
of Euripides. The Ilpds MapukWav is an exhortation to his 
•wife Marcella to practise virtue and self-restraint and to study 
philosophy. The letter to the Egyptian priest Anebo, dealing with 
religious questions, was answered by a member of the school of 
Iamblichus, who called himself Abammon, in the De mysteriis. 
It is frequently referred to by Eusebius, Cyril and Augustine. 
Eusebius preserved fragments of the Utpl tt}$ Ik XotIwv <f>i\oao<f>las 
(De philosophia ex oraculis haurienda), in which he expressed his 
belief in the responses of the oracles of various gods as confirming 
his theosophical views. Porphyry is well known as a violent 
opponent of Christianity and defender of Paganism; of his Kara 
XpiaTiavw (Adversus Christianos) in 15 books, perhaps the most 
important of all his works, only fragments remain. Counter-treatises 
were written by Eusebius of Caesarea, Apollinarius (or Apollinaris) of 
Laodicea, Methodius of Olympus, and Macarius of Magnesia, but all 
these are lost. Porphyry's view of the book of Daniel, that it was 
the work of a writer in the time of Antiochus^ Epiphanes, is given 
by Jerome. There is no proof of the assertion of Socrates, the 
ecclesiastical historian, and Augustine, that Porphyry was once a 
Christian. 

There is no complete edition of the works of Porphyry. Separate

PORPHYRY (Gr. irop4>vpeos, Lat. purpureus y purple), in 
petrology, a beautiful red volcanic rock which was much used 
by the Romans for ornamental purposes when cut and polished. 
The famous red porphyry (porfido rosso antico) came from Egypt, 
but its beauty and decorative value were first recognized by the 
Romans in the time of the emperor Claudius. It was obtained 
on the west coast of the Red Sea, where it forms a dike 80 or 
90 ft. thick. For a long time the knowledge of its source was 
lost, but the original locality, marked by many ancient quarries, 
has been re-discovered at Jebel Dhokan, and the stone is again 
an article of commerce. In a dark red ground-mass it contains 
many small white or rose-red plagioclase felspars, black shining 
prisms of hornblende, and small plates of iron oxide. The red 
colour of the felspars and of the ground-mass is unusual in rocks 
of this group, and arises from the partial conversion of the 
plagioclase felspar into thulite and manganese-epidote. These 
minerals also occur in thin veins crossing the rock. Many 






specimens show effects of crushing and in extreme cases this has 
produced brecciation. Another famous porphyry, hardly less 
beautiful, is the verde antique^ porfido verde antico t or marmor 
lacedaemonium viride of Pliny, which was obtained between 
Lebetsova and Marathonisi in Peloponnesus. It has the same 
structure as the red porphyry as it contains large white or green 
felspars in a fine ground-mass. The green colour arises from the 
abundant formation of chlorite and epidote in the large felspars 
and throughout the rock. In ancient times it was much used 
as an ornamental stone, these two varieties of porphyry making 
a fine contrast with one another. Green porphyries are not 
so rare as red. A similar rock is obtained at Lambay Island 
near Dublin. They are still used extensively, especially for 
small ornaments. Large pieces are difficult to obtain free from 
flaws, and marble is preferred for mural work, not only because 
of the greater variety of patterns but also because it is much 
softer and more easily cut and polished. 

Many igneous rocks possess the structure which characterizes 
these porphyries (see Petrology, Plate^IIL): the presence of 
scattered crystals of larger size in a fine-grained ground-mass. 
Most lavas, and many of the rocks which occur as dikes and sills, 
have porphyritic structure. These may be called porphyries 
and this term has consequently been applied to a great variety 
of rocks, e.g. diorite-porphyry, granite-porphyry, greenstone- 
porphyry, augite-porphyry, liebenerite-porphyry, &c. More 
recently the use of the term has been restricted to a series of 
rocks which are of intrusive origin and contain much porphyritic 
felspar (with or without quartz or nepheline). The porphyritic 
intrusive rocks with large crystals of augite, olivine, biotite, and 
hornblende are for the most part grouped under the lampro- 
phyres; while the term porphyry is rarely now applied to any 
of the effusive rocks or lavas. Furthermore, it has become 
usual to subdivide the intrusive porphyries into two classes; 
in one of these the phenocrysts are mainly orthoclase, in the 
other mainly plagioclase felspar. The first series is known as 
the " porphyries," while the second group is called " porphy- 
rites." There are porphyries which correspond chemically and 
mineralogically to granites, syenites, and nepheline-syenites; 
while the porphyrites form a parallel series to the diorites, 
norites and gabbros. In each case the porphyritic type occurs 
generally as dikes and thin sheets which consolidated beneath 
the surface but probably at no great depth (hypabyssal rocks); 
while granite, gabbro and the other noncrystalline non-por- 
phyritic rocks belong to the plutonic or abyssal group which 
cooled very slowly at great depths and under enormous pressure. 

The principal subdivisions of the group are the granite-porphyries, 
the syenite-porphyries and the elaeolite-porphyries. In all of them 
porphyritic orthoclase or alkali felspar is the characteristic mineral. 
The granite-porphyries and quartz-porphyries (q.v.) consist mainly 
of orthoclase, quartz and ferro-magnesian mineral, usually biotite 
but sometimes hornblende, augite or enstatite. 

Granite-porphyries are exceedingly common in all regions where 
acid intrusive rocks occur. Many granite masses are surrounded 
by dikes of this kind, and in some cases the chilled margin of a granite 
consists of typical porphyry. 

The syenite-porphyries, like the syenites, are less common than the 
granite-porphyries and granites. They are characterized by an 
abundance of orthoclase and a scarcity or absence of quartz. The 
phenocrysts are orthoclase (and oligoclase), biotite, hornblende or 
augite; the ground-mass is principally alkali felspar with sometimes 
a little quartz. In many specimens the felspars of the second 
generation form a mosaic of ill-shaped grains, in others they are 
little rectangular crystals which may have a fluxion arrangement 
(orthophyric type of ground-mass). Some of the rocks formerly 
known as orthoclase-porphyries belong to this group; others are 
ancient trachytic lavas (orthophyres). Closely related to the 
syenite-porphyries is the rhomben-porphyry of south Norway and 
West Africa. In these the large felspars have rhomb-shaped sections 
owing^ to their peculiar crystalline development. Olivine, augite 
and biotite occur in these rocks, but there is no quartz or soda-lime 
felspar. The porphyritic felspars contain both soda and potash 
and. belong to anorthoclase. Rhomben-porphyries occur as dikes 
connected with the syenites (laurvikites f southern Norway), and 
many ice-borne boulders of these rocks have been found among the 
drift deposits of the east of England. 

Elaeolite- and leucite- (syenite) porphyries form apophyses and 
dikes around nepheline- and leucite-syenite intrusions. The former 
contain porphyritic nepheline which is often weathered to soft, 



PORPOISE 



105 



finely crystalline aggregates of white mica and other secondary 
products as in the well-known I iebenerite- porphyry of Tirol and 
gieseckite-porphyry of Greenland. The felspars of these rocks 
are albite, orthoclase and anorthoclase, and they often con- 
tain soda-augitc and amphiboles. Elaeolite-porphyries occur 
along with ncpheline-sycnites in such districts as the Serra de 
Monchique, south Norway, Kola, Montreal. Allied to them are 
the tinguaites (so called from the Serra de Tingua, Rio de Janeiro, 
Brazil), which are pale green rocks with abundant alkali felspar 
nepheline, needles of green aegirine, and sometimes ^biotite and 
cancrinite. As a rule, however, these are not porphyritic. Some 
authors group the tinguaites with the aplites rather than the por- 
phyries. Grorudites are quartz-tinguaites free from nepheline, 
and sdlvsbergites are tinguaitic rocks in which neither quartz nor 
nepheline occur. The two last varieties have been described from 
the Christiania district in Norway, but tinguaites are known with 
nepheline-syenites in many parts of the world, e.g. Norway, Brazil, 
Portugal, Canada, Sweden, Greenland.

Porpkyrites. — The porphyrites as above mentioned are 
intrusive or hypabyssal rocks of porphyritic texture, with 
phenocrysts of plagioclase felspar and hornblende, biotite 
or augite (sometimes also quartz) in a fine ground-mass. The 
name has not always been used in this sense, but formerly 
signified rather decomposed andesitic and basaltic lavas of 
Carboniferous age and older. Both the red porphyry and the 
green porphyry of the ancients are more properly classified in 
this group than with the granite-porphyries, as their dominant 
felspar is plagioclase and they contain little or no primary 
quartz. Porphyrites occur as dikes which accompany masses 
of diorite, and are often called diorite-porphyrites; they differ 
from diorites in few respects except their porphyritic structure. 
The phenocrysts are plagioclase, often much zoned with central 
kernels of bytownite or labradorite and margins of oligoclase 
or even orthoclase. In a special group there are corroded blebs 
or porphyritic quartz: these rocks are called quartz-porphyrites, 
and are distinguished from the granite-porphyries by the scarcity 
or absence of orthoclase. The hornblende of the porphyrites 
is often green but sometimes brown, resembling that of the 
lamprophyres, a group from which the porphyrites are separated 
by their containing phenocrysts of felspar, which do not occur 
in normal lamprophyres. Augite, when present, is nearly 
always pale green; it is not so abundant as hornblende. Dark 
brown biotite is very common in large hexagonal plates. 
Muscovite and olivine are not represented in these rocks. The 
ground-mass is usually a crystalline aggregate of granular 
felspar in which plagioclase dominates, though orthoclase is 
rarely absent. The Alpine dike rocks known as ortlerites and 
suldenites are porphyrites containing much green or brown 
hornblende and augite; these, however, hardly require a dis- 
tinctive designation. Diorite-porphyrites have almost as wide 
a distribution as granite-porphyries, and occur in all parts of 
the world where intrusions of granite and diorite have been 
injected; they are in fact among the commonest hypabyssal 
rocks. 

To gabbros and norites certain types of porphyrite correspond 
which have the same mineral and chemical composition as the 
parent rocks but with a porphyritic instead of granitic structure. 
Gabbro-porphyrites are not numerous; or rather most of these 
rocks are described as porphyritic basalts and dolcritcs. The 
beerbachites are finely granular dike rocks resembling gabbros 



in all respects except in their being less coarsely crystalline. 
Norite-porphy rites have porphyritic plagioclase (labradorite 
usually) with hypersthene or bronzite, often altered to bastite. 
They accompany norite masses in Nahe (Prussia) and Tirol. 
They have vitreous forms which are described as andesitic- 
pitchstones or hypcrsthene-andesites.

PORPOISE (sometimes spelled Porpus and Porpesse), a name 
derived from the O. Fr. porpeis, for porc-peis> i.e. pig-fish, Lat. 
porcus, pig, and ptscis, fish; the mod. Fr. marsouin is borrowed 
from the Ger. meerschwein, although the word is commonly 
used by sailors to designate all the smaller cetaceans, especially 
those numerous species which naturalists 'call " dolphins," 
it is properly restricted to the common porpoise of the British 
seas {Phocaena communis , or P t phocaena). 

The porpoise, when full grown, attains a length of 5 ft. or 
more; the dimensions of an adult female specimen from the

flukes of the tail, 62 \ in.; from the nose to the front edge 
of the dorsal fin, 29 in.; height of dorsal fin, 4^ in.; 
length of base of dorsal fin, 8 in.; length of pectoral fin, 9 J in.; 
breadth of pectoral fin, 3 \ in. ; breadth of tail flukes, 
13 in. The head is rounded in front, and differs from that 
of dolphins in not having the snout produced into a distinct 
" beak " separated from the forehead by a groove. The under 
jaw projects about half an inch beyond the upper. The mouth 
is wide, bounded by stiff immobile lips, and curves slightly 
upwards at the hinder end. The eye is small, and the external 
ear represented by a minute aperture, scarcely larger than would 
be made by a pin, about 2 in. behind the eye. The dorsal 
fin, near the middle of the back, is low and triangular. The 
flippers are of moderate size, and slightly sickle-shaped. The 
upper-parts are dark grey or nearly black according to the light 
in which they are viewed and the state of moisture or otherwise 
of the skin; the under-parts pure white. The line of demarca- 
tion between these colours is not distinct, washes or splashes of 
grey encroaching upon the white on the sides, and varies some- 
what in different individuals. Usually it passes from the throat 
(the anterior part of which, with the whole of the under jaw, 
is dark) above the origin of the flipper, along the middle of the 
flank, and descends again to the middle line before reaching the 
tail. Both sides of the flippers and flukes are black. The an- 
terior edge of the dorsal fin is furnished with a row of small rounded 
horny spines or, rather, tubercles, of variable number. One of

the most characteristic anatomical distinctions between the 
porpoise and other members of the Delphinidae is the form of the 
teeth (numbering twenty-three to twenty-six on each side of 
each jaw), which have expanded, flattened, spade-like crowns, 
with more or less marked vertical grooves, giving a tendency to 
a bilobed or often trilobed form (fig. 2). 

The porpoise, which is sociable and gregarious, is usually seen 
in small herds, and frequents coasts, bays, and estuaries rather

than the open ocean* It is the commonest cetacean in the 
seas round the British Isles, and not infrequently ascends the 
Thames, having been seen as high as Richmond; it has also been 
observed in the Seine at Neuilly, near Paris. It frequents the 
Scandinavian coasts, entering the Baltic in the summer; and is 
found as far north as Baffin's Bay and as far west as the coasts 
of the United States. Southward its range is more limited 
than that of the dolphin, as, though common on the Atlantic 
coasts of France, it is not known to enter the Mediterranean. 

It feeds on mackerel, pilchards and herrings and, following 
the shoals, is often caught by fishermen in the nets along with 
its prey. In former times it was a common article of food in 
England and France, but is now rarely if ever eaten, being 
valuable only for the oil obtained from its blubber. Its skin is 
sometimes used for leather and boot- thongs, but the so-called 
" porpoise-hides " are generally obtained from the beluga. 
The Black Sea porpoise (P. relicta) is a distinct species. A third 
species, from the American coast of the North Pacific, has been 
described under the name of Phocaena vomerina, and another 
from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata as P. spinipennis. Nearly 
allied is Neopkocaena phocaenoides, a small species from the Indian 
Ocean and Japan, with teeth of the same form as those of the por- 
poise, but fewer in number (eighteen to twenty on each side), of 
larger size, and more distinctly notched or lobed on the free edge. 
It is distinguished from the common porpoise externally by 
its black hue and the absence of a dorsal fin. (See Cetacea.)

PORPORA, NICCOLA [or Niccolo] ANTONIO (1686-1767), 
Italian operatic composer and teacher of singing, was born in 
Naples on the 19th of August 1686. He was educated at the 
Conservatorio di Santa Maria di Loreto. His first opera, 
Basilio, was produced at Naples; his second, Berenice, at Rome. 
Both were successful, and he followed them up by innumerable 
compositions of like character; but his fame rests chiefly upon 
his unequalled power of teaching singing. At the Conservatorio 
di Sant' Onofrio and the Poveri di Gesu Cristo he trained 
Farinelli, Caffarelli, Mingotti, Salimbeni, and other celebrated 
vocalists. Still his numerous engagements did not tempt him 
to forsake composition. In 1725 he visited Vienna, but the 
Emperor Charles VI. disliked his florid style, especially his con- 
stant use of the tritlo, and refused to patronize him. After this 
rebuff he settled in Venice, teaching regularly in the schools of 
La Pieta and the Incurabili. In 1729 he was invited to London 
as a rival to Handel; but his visit was unfortunate. Little less 
disastrous was his second visit to England in 1734, when even 
the presence of his pupil, the great Farinelli, failed to save the 
dramatic company of Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre, known as the 
" Opera of the Nobility," from ruin. The sequence of dates 
and visits in Porpora's life are variously stated by different 
biographers. The electoral prince of Saxony and king of Poland 
had invited him to Dresden to become the singing master of the 
electoral princess, Maria Antonia, and in 1748 he is supposed 
to have been made Kapellmeister to the prince. Difficult 
relations, however, with Hasse and his wife resulted in his 
departure, of which the date is not known. From Dresden he 



is said to have gone to Vienna, where he gave lessons to Joseph 
Haydn (q.v.), and then to have returned in 1759 to Naples.' 
From this time Porpora's career was a series of misfortunes. 
His last opera, Camilla, failed; and he became so poor that the 
expenses of his funeral were paid by subscription. Yet at the 
moment of his death in 1767 Farinelli and Caffarelli were living 
in splendour on fortunes for which they were largely indebted 
to the excellence of the old maestro's teaching. In George 
Sand's Consuelo much use is made of a romantic version of the life 
of young Haydn and his relations with the heroine, Porpora's 
pupil, and with Porpora himself. A good linguist and a man of 
considerable literary culture, Porpora was also celebrated for 
his power of repartee. His operas are, on the whole, tedious and 
conventional; but he produced some good work in the form of 
instrumental music and chamber-cantatas. A series of six 
Latin duets on the Passion (accessible in a modern edition 
published by Breitkopf and Haertel) is remarkable for dignity 
and beauty. 

PORRIDGE (an altered form of "pottage," Fr. potage, 
soup, that which is cooked in a pot), a food made by stirring 
meal, especially oatmeal, in boiling water and cooking it slowly 
until the whole becomes soft. The dish and its name are 
particularly identified with Scotland; in Ireland it is commonly 
known as " stir-about." The former application to a broth 
made of vegetables or of meat and vegetables thickened with 
barley or other meal is obsolete, and the earlier " pottage " 
is the usual word employed. The form " porridge " apparently 
dates from the 16th century. In " porringer," a porridge-bowl, 
the n is inserted as in " passenger," " messenger." 

PORSENA (or Porsenna),LARS, king of Clusium in Etruria. 
He is said to have undertaken an expedition against Rome 
in order to restore the banished Tarquinius Superbus to the 
throne. He gained possession of the Janiculum, and was 
prevented from entering Rome only by the bravery of Horatius 
Codes (q.v.). Porsena then laid siege to the city, but was so 
struck by the courage of Mucius Scaevola that he made peace 
on condition that the Romans restored the land they had taken 
from Veii and gave him twenty hostages. He subsequently 
returned both the land and the hostages (Livy, ii. 0-15; Dion. 
Halic, v. 21-34; Plutarch, Poplicola, p. 16-19). This story is 
probably an attempt to conceal a great disaster and to soothe 
the vanity of the Romans by accounts of legendary exploits. 
According to other authorities, the Romans were obliged to 
surrender the city, to acknowledge Porsena's supremacy by 
sending him a sceptre, a royal robe, and an ivory chair, to 
abandon their territory north of the Tiber, to give up their 
arms, and in future to use iron for agricultural purposes only. 
It is curious that, in spite of his military success, Porsena made 
no attempt to restore the Tarquinian dynasty. Hence it is 
suggested that the attack on Rome was merely an incident of 
the march of the Etruscans, driven southward by the invasion 
of upper Italy by the Celts, through Latium on their way to 
Campania. This would account for its transitory effects, and 
the speedy recovery of the Romans from the blow. With the 
departure of Porsena all traces of Etruscan sovereignty disappear 
and Rome is soon vigorously engaged in the prosecution of 
various wars (see Tacitus, Hist. iii. 72; Pliny, Nat. Hist, xxxiv. 
39 [14]; Dion. Halic. v. 35, 36, vii. 5). The tomb at Chiusi 
described by Pliny (Nat. Hist, xxxvi. 19) as that of Porsena 
cannot have been his burial-place (see Clusium). 

For a critical examination of the story, see Schwegler, Romische 
Geschichte, bk. xxi. 18; Sir G. Cornewall Lewis, Credibility of Early 
Roman History, ch. xii. 5; W. Ihne, Hist, of Rome, vol. i.; E. Pais, 
Storia di Roma^ i. ch. iv. (1898). Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome 
gives a dramatic version of the story. 

PORSON, RICHARD (1750-1808), English classical scholar, 
was born on Christmas Day 1759 at East Ruston, near North 
Walsham, in Norfolk, the eldest son of Huggin Porson, parish 
clerk. His mother was the daughter of a shoemaker named 
Palmer, of the neighbouring village of Bacton. He was sent 
first to the village school at Bacton, kept by John Woodrow. 
and afterwards to that of Happisburgh kept by Mr Summers.

Here his extraordinary powers of memory and aptitude for 
arithmetic were soon discovered; his skill in penmanship, which 
attended him through life, was due to the care of Summers, 
who became early impressed with his abilities, and long after- 
wards stated that during fifty years of scholastic life he had 
never come across boys so clever as Porson and his two brothers. 
He was well grounded in Latin by Summers, remaining with him 
for three years. His father also took pains with his education, 
making him repeat at night the lessons he had learned in the day. 
He would frequently repeat without making a mistake a lesson 
which he had learned one or two years before and had never seen 
in the interval. For books he had only what his father's cottage 
supplied — a book or two of arithmetic, Greenwood's England, 
Jewell's Apology, and an odd volume of Chamber's Cyclopaedia 
picked up from a wrecked coaster, and eight or ten volumes of 
the Universal Magazine. 

When Porson was eleven years old the Rev. T. Hewitt, 
the curate of East Ruston and two neighbouring villages, 
took charge of his education. Mr Hewitt taught him with 
his own boys, taking him through the ordinary Latin 
authors, Caesar, Terence, Ovid and Virgil; before this he had 
made such progress in mathematics as to be able to solve ques- 
tions out of the Ladies 9 Diary. In addition to this Hewitt 
brought him under the notice of Mr Norris of Witton Park, who 
sent him to Cambridge and had him examined by Professor 
Lambert, the two tutors of Trinity, Postlethwaite and Collier, 
and the well-known mathematician Atwood, then assistant 
tutor; the result was so favourable a report of his knowledge 
and abilities that Mr Norris determined to provide for his educa- 
tion so as to fit him for the university. This was in 1773. It 
was found impossible to get him into Charterhouse, and he was 
entered on the foundation of Eton in August 1774. 

Of his Eton life Porson had no very pleasant recollections, 
but he was popular among his schoolfellows; and two dramas 
he wrote for performance in the Long Chamber were remembered 
many years later. His marvellous memory was of course 
noticed; but at first he seems to have somewhat disappointed 
the expectations of his friends, as his composition was weak, 
and his ignorance of quantity kept him behind several of his 
inferiors. He went to Eton too late to have any chance of 
succeeding to a scholarship at King's College. In 1777 he 
suffered a great loss from the death of his patron Mr Norris; 
but contributions from Etonians to aid in the funds for his 
maintenance at the university were rapidly supplied, and he 
found a successor to Norris in Sir George Baker, the physician, at 
that time president of the college of physicians. Chiefly through 
his means Porson was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, as 
a pensioner on the 28th of March 1778, matriculating in April. It 
is said that what first biassed his mind towards critical researches 
was the gift of a copy of Toup's Longinns by Dr Da vies, the 
head master of Eton, for a good exercise; but it was Bentlcy 
and Richard Dawes to whom he looked as his immediate masters. 
His critical career was begun systematically while an under- 
graduate. He became a scholar of Trinity in 1780, won the 
Craven university scholarship in 1781, and took his degree of 
B.A. in 1782, as third senior optime, obtaining soon afterwards 
the first chancellor's medal for classical studies. The same 
year he was elected Fellow of Trinity, a very unusual thing for a 
junior bachelor of arts, as the junior bachelors were rarely 
allowed to be candidates for fellowships, a regulation which lasted 
from 1667 when Isaac Newton was elected till 181 8 when Connop 
Thirlwall became a fellow. Porson graduated M.A. in 1785. 

Having thus early secured his independence, he turned his 
thoughts to publication. The first occasion of his appearing 
in print was in a short notice of Schutz's Aeschylus in Maty's 
Review, written in 1783. This review contains several other 
essays by his hand; especially may be mentioned the reviews 
of R. F. Brunck's Aristophanes (containing an able summary 
of the poet's chief excellencies and defects), Weston's Hermes- 
ianax, and Huntingford's Apology for the Monostrophics. But 
it was to the tragedians, and especially to Aeschylus, that his 
mind was then chiefly directed. He began a correspondence 



with David Ruhnken, the veteran scholar of Leiden, requesting 
to be favoured with any fragments of Aeschylus that Ruhnken 
had come across in his collection of inedited lexicons and gram- 
marians, and sending him, as a proof that he was not under- 
taking a task for which he was unequal, some specimens of his 
critical powers, and especially of his restoration of a very corrupt 
passage in theSupplices (673-677) by the help of a nearly equally 
corrupt passage of Plutarch's Erotkus. As the syndics of the 
Cambridge press were proposing to re-edit Thomas Stanley's 
Aeschylus, the editorship was offered to Porson; but he declined 
to undertake it on the conditions laid down, namely, of reprint- 
ing Stanley's corrupt text and incorporating all the variorum 
notes, however worthless. He was especially anxious that the 
Medicean MS. at Florence should be collated for the new edition, 
and offered to undertake the collation at an expense not greater 
than it would have cost if done by a person on the spot; but the 
syndics refused the offer, the vice-chancellor (Mr Torkington, 
master of Clare Hall) observing that Porson might collect his 
MSS. at home. 

In 1786, a new edition of Hutchinson's Anabasis of Xcnophon 
being called for, Porson was requested by the publisher to supply 
a few notes, which he did in conjunction with the Rev. W. 
Whiter, editor of the Etymologicon universale. These give the 
first specimen of that neat and terse style of Latin notes in which 
he was afterwards without a rival. They also show his intimate 
acquaintance with his two favourite authors, Plato and 
Athenacus, and a familiarity with Eustathius's commentary 
on Homer. 

In 1787 the Notae breves ad Toupii emendationes in Suidam 
were written, though they did not appear till 1790 in the new 
edition of Toup's book published at Oxford. These first made 
Porson's name known as a scholar of the first rank, and carried 
his fame beyond England. The letters he received from 
Christian G. Heyne and G. Hermann preserved in the library of 
Trinity College, and written before his Euripides was published, 
afford proof of this. In his notes he points out the errors of 
Toup and others; at the same time he speaks of Toup's book as 
" opus illud aureum," and states that his writing the notes at 
all is due to the admiration he had for it. They contain some 
brilliant emendations of various authors; but the necessity of 
having Toup's own notes with them has prevented their ever 
being reprinted in a separate form. 

During this year, in the Gentleman's Magazine, he wrote 
the three letters on Hawkins's Life of Johnson which have 
been reprinted by Mr Kidd in his Tracts and Criticisms of Porson, 
and in a volume of Porson's Correspondence. They are admirable 
specimens of the dry humour so characteristic of the writer, and 
prove his intimate acquaintance with Shakespeare and the other 
English dramatists and poets. In the same periodical, in the 
course of 1788 and 1789, appeared the Letters to Archdeacon 
Travis, on the spurious verse 1 John v. 7 (collected in 1790 into 
a volume), which must be considered to have settled the question. 
Gibbon's verdict on the book, that it was " the most acute and 
accurate piece of criticism since the days of Bentley," may be 
considered as somewhat partial, as it was in defence of him that 
Porson had entered the field against Travis. But in the masterly 
sketch of Gibbon's work and style in the preface Porson does not 
write in a merely flattering tone. It is to be wished that on 
such a subject the tone of levity had been modified. But 
Porson says in his preface that he could treat the subject in no 
other manner, if he treated it at all: " To peruse such a mass of 
falsehood and sophistry and to write remarks upon it, without 
sometimes giving way to laughter and sometimes to indignation, 
was, to me at least, impossible." Travis has no mercy shown 
him, but he certainly deserved none. One is equally struck with 
the thorough grasp Porson displays of his subject, the amount 
o"Miis miscellaneous learning, and the humour that pervades the 
whole. But it was then the unpopular side: the publisher is 
said to have lost money by the book; and one of his early friends, 
Mrs Turner of Norwich, cut down a legacy she had left Porson 
to £30 on being told that he had written what was described to 
her as a book against Christianity.

PORSON 



During the years that followed he continued to contribute 
to the leading reviews, writing in the Monthly Review the articles 
on Robertson's Parian Chronicle, Edwards's Plutarch, and 
R. Payne Knight's Essay on the Greek Alphabet. He gave 
assistance to William Beloe in one or two articles in the British 
Critick, and probably wrote also in the Analytical Review and 
the Critical Review. 

In 1792 his fellowship was no longer tenable by a layman; 
and, rather than undertake duties for which he felt himself 
unfit, and which involved subscription to the Articles (though 
he had no difficulty as to signing a statement as to his conformity 
with the liturgy of the Church of England when elected Greek 
professor) , he determined not to take holy orders, which 
would have enabled him to remain a fellow, and thus deprived 
himself of his only means of subsistence. He might have been 
retained in the society by being appointed to a lay fellowship, 
one of the two permanent lay fellowships which the statutes 
then permitted falling vacant just in time. It is said that this 
had been promised him, and it was certainly the custom in the 
college always to appoint the senior among the existing laymen, 
who otherwise would vacate his fellowship. But the master 
(Dr PostlethwaiteJ, who had the nomination, used his privilege 
to nominate a younger man (John Heys), a nephew of his own, 
and thus Porson was turned adrift without any means of support. 
A subscription was, however, got up among his friends to provide 
an annuity to -keep him from actual want; Crach erode, Cleaver 
Banks, Burney and Parr took the lead, and enough was collected 
to produce about £100 a year. He accepted it only on the 
condition that he should receive the interest during his lifetime, 
and that the principal, placed in the hands of trustees, should 
be returned to the donors at his death. When this occurred they 
or their survivors refused to receive the money, and it was with 
part of this sum that, in 1816, the Porson prize was founded to 
perpetuate his name at Cambridge. The remainder was devoted 
to the foundation of the Porson scholarship in the same univer- 
sity. This scholarship was first awarded in 1855. 

After the loss of his fellowship he continued chiefly to reside 
in London, having chambers in Essex Court, Temple — occasion- 
ally visiting his friends, such as Dr Goodall at Eton and Dr 
Samuel Parr at Hatton. It was at Dr Goodall's house that 
the Letters to Travis were written, and at one period of his life he 
spent a great deal of time at Hatton. While there he would 
generally spend his mornings in the library, and for the most 
part in silence; but in the evenings, especially if Parr were 
away, he would collect the young men of the house about him, 
and pour forth from memory torrents of every kind of literature. 
The charms of his society are described as being then irresistible. 

In 1702 the Greek professorship at Cambridge became vacant 
by the resignation of Mr Cooke. To this Porson was elected 
without opposition, and he continued to hold it till his death. 
The duties then consisted in taking a part in the examinations 
for the university scholarships and classical medals. It was 
said he wished to give lectures; but lecturing was not in fashion 
in those days, and he did far more to advance the knowledge 
and study of the Greek language by his publications than he 
could have done by any amount of lecturing. It must be re- 
membered that the emoluments of the professorship were only 
£40 a year. The authors on which his time was chiefly spent 
were the tragedians, Aristophanes, Athenaeus, and the lexicons 
of Suidas, Hesychius and Photius. This last he twice tran- 
scribed (the first transcript having been destroyed by a fire at 
Perry's house, -which deprived the world of much valuable matter 
that he had written on the margins of his books) from the original 
among the Gale MSS. in the library of Trinity College. Of the 
brilliancy and accuracy of his emendations on Aristophanes, 
the fragments of the other comic poets, and the lexicographers 
he had a pleasing proof on one occasion when he found how often 
in Aristophanes he had been anticipated by Bentley, and on 
another when Schow's collation of the unique MS. of Hesychius 



appeared and proved him right in " an incredible number 
instances. 
In 1795 there appeared from Foulis's press at Glasgow 



of 



an 



edition of Aeschylus in folio, printed with the same types as the 
Glasgow Homer, without a word of preface or anything to give 
a clue to the editor. Many new readings were inserted in the 
text with an asterisk affixed, while an obelus was used to mark 
many others as corrupt. It was at once recognized as Porson's 
work; he had superintended the printing of a small edition in 
two vols. 8vo, but this was kept back by the printer and not 
issued till 1806, still without the editor's name. There are 
corrections of many more passages in this edition than in the 
folio; and, though the text cannot be considered as what would 
have gone forth if with his name and sanction, yet more is done 
for the text of Aeschylus than had been accomplished by any 
preceding editor. It has formed the substratum for all subse- 
quent editions. It was printed from a copy of Pauw's edition 
corrected, which is preserved in the library of Trinity College. 

Soon after this, in 1797, appeared the first instalment of what 
was intended to be a complete edition of Euripides — an edition 
of the Hecuba. 

In the preface he pointed out the correct method of writing 
several words previously incorrectly written, and gave some 
specimens of his powers on the subject of Greek metres. The 
notes are very short, almost entirely critical; but so great a 
range of learning, combined with such felicity of emendation 
whenever a corrupt passage was encountered, is displayed that 
there was never any doubt as to the quarter whence the new 
edition had proceeded. He avoided the office of interpreter in 
his notes, which may well be wondered at on recollecting how 
admirably he did translate when he condescended to that branch 
of an editor's duties. 

His work, however, did not escape attack; Gilbert Wakefield 
had already published a Tragoediarum delectus; and, conceiving 
himself to be slighted, as there was no mention of his labours in 
the new Hecuba, he wrote a " diatribe extemporalis " against it, 
a tract which for bad taste, bad Latin and bad criticism it would 
not be easy to match. Gottfried Hermann of Leipzig, then a 
very young man, who had also written a work on Greek metres, 
which Dr Elmsley has styled " a book of which too much ill 
cannot easily be said," issued an edition of the Hecuba, in which 
Porson's theories were openly attacked. Porson at first took 
no notice of either, but went on quietly with his Euripides, 
publishing the Orestes in 1798, the Phoenissae in 1799 and the 
Medea in 1 801, the last printed at the Cambridge press, and with 
the editor's name on the title-page. But there are many allu- 
sions to his antagonists in the notes on such points as the final 
v, the use of accents, &c; and on v. 675 of the Medea he holds up 
Hermann by name to scorn in caustic and taunting language. 
And it is more than probable that to Hermann's attack we owe 
the most perfect of his works, the supplement to the preface to 
the Hecuba, prefixed to the second edition published at 
Cambridge in 1802. The metrical laws promulgated are laid 
down clearly, illustrated with an ample number of examples, and 
those that militate against them brought together and corrected, 
so that what had been beyond the reach of the ablest scholars of 
preceding times is made clear to the tyro. The laws of the 
iambic metre are fully explained, and the theory of the pause 
stated and proved, which had been only alluded to in the first 
edition. A third edition of the Hecuba appeared in 1808, and 
he left corrected copies of the other plays, of which new editions 
appeared soon after his death ; but these four plays were all that 
was accomplished of the projected edition of the poet. Porson 
lived six years after the second edition of the Hecuba was 
published, but his natural indolence and procrastination led 
him to put off the work. He found time, however, to execute 
his collation of the Harleian MS. of the Odyssey, published in 
the Grenville Homer in 1801, and to present to the Society of 
Antiquaries his wonderful conjectural restoration of the Rosetta 
stone. 

In 1806, when the London Institution was founded (then 
in the Old Jewry, since removed to Finsbury Circus), he was 
appointed principal librarian with a salary of £200 a year and 
a suite of rooms; and thus his latter years were made easy as 
far as money was concerned.

Among his most intimate friends was Perry, the editor of 
the Morning Chronicle; and this friendship was cemented by 
his marriage with Perry's sister, Mrs Lunan, in November 1796. 
The marriage was a happy one for the short time it lasted, as 
Porson became more attentive to times and seasons, and would 
have been weaned from his habits of drinking; but she sank in 
a decline a few months after her marriage (April 12, i797)> and 
he returned to his chambers in the Temple and his old habits. 
Perry's friendship was of great value to him in many ways; but 
it induced him to spend too much of his time in writing for the 
Morning Chronicle; indeed he was even accused of " giving up 
to Perry what was meant for mankind," and the existence of 
some of the papers he wrote there can be only deplored. 

For some months before his death he had appeared to be 
failing: his memory was not what it had been, and he had some 
symptoms of intermittent fever; but on the 19th of September 
1808 he was seized in the street with a fit of apoplexy, and after 
partially recovering sank in the 25th of that month at the age 
of forty-nine. He was buried in Trinity College, close to the 
statue of Newton, at the opposite end of the chapel to where 
rest the remains of Bentley. 

In learning Porson was superior to Valckenaer, in accuracy to 
Bentley. It must be remembered that in^ his day the science of 
comparative philology had scarcely any existence; even the com- 
parative value of MSS. was scarcely considered in editing an ancient 
author. With many editors MSS. were treated as of much the same 
value, whether they were really from the hand of a trustworthy 
scribe, or what Bentley calls " scrub manuscripts," or " scoundrel 
copies." Thus, if we are to find fault with Porson's way of editing, 
it is that he does not make sufficient difference between the MSS. 
he uses, or point out the relative value of the early copies whether 
in MS. or print. Thus he collates minutely Lascans's edition of the 
Medea,' mentioning even misprints in the text, rather from its rarity 
and costliness than from its intrinsic value. m And his wonderful 
quickness at emendation has sometimes led him into error, which 
greater investigation into MSS. would have avoided; thus, in his 
note on Eur., Phoein. 1373 an error, perhaps a misprint (ice for jie), 
in the first edition of the scholiast on Sophocles has led him into 
an emendation of v. 339 of the Trachiniae which clearly will not 
stand. But his most brilliant emendations, such as some of those 
on Athenaeus, on the Supplices of Aeschylus, or, to take one single 
instance, that on Eur. Helen, 751 (o&5* "EXtws for obhkvyt; see 
Maltby's Thesaurus, p. 299), are such as convince the reader of their 
absolute certainty; and this power was possessed by Porson to a 
degree no one else has ever attained. No doubt his mathematical 
training had something to do with this; frequently the process may 
be seen by which the truth has been reached. 

A few words are called for on his general character. No one ever 
more loved truth for its own sake; few have sacrificed more rather 
than violate their consciences, and this at a time when a_ high 
standard in this respect was not common. In spite of his failings, 
few have had warmer friends; no one more willingly communicated 
his knowledge and gave help to others; scarcely a book appeared 
in his time or for some years after his death on the subjects to 
which he devoted his life without acknowledging assistance from 
him. And, if it be remembered that his life was a continued struggle 
against poverty and slight and ill-health, rather than complain that 
he did little, we should wonder how he accomplished so much. 

His library was divided into two parts, one of which was sold by 
auction; the other, containing the transcript of the Gale Photius, 
his books' with MS. notes, and some letters from foreign scholars, 
was bought by Trinity College for 1000 guineas. His notebooks 
were found to contain, in the words of Bishop Blomfield, " a rich 
treasure of criticism in every branch of classical literature — every- 
thing carefully and correctly written and sometimes rewritten — 
quite fit to meet the public eye, without any diminution or addition." 
They have been carefully rearranged, and illustrate among other things 
his extraordinary penmanship and power of minute and accurate 
writing. Much remains unpublished. J. H. Monk, his successor as 
Greek professor, and C. J. Blomfield (both afterwards bishops) 
edited the Adversaria, consisting of the notes on Athenaeus and the 
Greek poets, and his prelection on Euripides; P. P. Dobree, after- 
wards Greek professor, the notes on Aristophanes and the lexicon 
of Photius. Besides these, from other sources, Professor T. Gaisford 
edited his notes on Pausanias and Suidas, and Mr Kidd collected 
his scattered reviews. And, when Bishop Burgess attacked his 
literary character on the score of his Letters to Travis, Professor 
Turton (afterwards Bishop of Ely) came forward with a vindication.

PORT. (1) (From the Lat. portus, harbour), a place to which 
ships may resort for the unloading or taking in of cargo, or for 
shelter, a harbour, also a town possessing such a harbour, a 
" seaport," or " seaport town," especially one where custom- 
house officers are stationed. As the name of a dark red Portu- 
guese wine, the word is a shortened form of Oporto, i.e. the port, 
the chief centre of the wine-shipping trade of Portugal (see 
Wine). (2) (Through the Fr. porte, from Lat. porta, gate), 
an entrance or opening, not often used in the" sense of gate, 
except in such compounds as " sallyport," cf. " portcullis," 
and in the derivative " porter," a keeper of a door or gate, 
especially of a public building, hotel, college, &c. The most 
general use of the word is for an opening for the admission of 
light and air in a ship's side, and formerly in ships of w r ar for 
an embrasure for cannon, a " port-hole." For the appli cation 
of the word to the left side of a ship, taking the place of the 
earlier " larboard," and its disputed origin, see Starboard and 
Larboard. (3) (Through the Fr. porter, from Lat. portare, 
to carry, bear), properly outward bearing or deportment, 
whence " portly," originally of dignified or majestic bearing, 
now chiefly used in the sense of stout or corpulent. The verb 
" to port " is only used as a military term " to port arms," 
i.e. to hold the rifle across and close to the body, the barrel 
being placed opposite to the left shoulder. Derivatives are 
" port-fire " (Fr. porle-feu), a fuse for firing rockets, &c., 
and formerly for the discharge of artillery, and " porter," i.e. 
one who carries a burden, particularly a servant of a railway 
company, hotel, &c, who carries passengers' luggage to and 
from a station, &c. The term " porter " has been applied, 
since the 18th century, to a particular form of beer, dark brown 
or almost black in colour (see Beer and Brewing). The finer 
kinds of this beer are generally now known as " stout." The 
name is almost certainly due to the fact that it was from the 
first a favourite drink among the London " porters," the street 
carriers of goods, luggage, &c., and in early uses the drink is 
called porter's ale, porter's beer, or porter-beer. 

PORT ADELAIDE, a port of Adelaide county, South Australia, 
7 J m. by rail N.W. of Adelaide. Pop. of the town and suburbs 
(iqoi), 20,089. It is situated on an estuary 9 m. from St Vincent 
Gulf and is the principal shipping port of South Australia. Its 
wharves, equipped with steam and travelling cranes, and tram- 
ways, are 2% m. in extent; it has docks and a number of patent 
slips capable of taking up vessels of 300 to 1500 tons. There 
are also piers at Semaphore and LargVBay, on the other side of 
Lefevre's Peninsula some 2 m. distant, which are connected 
with Port Adelaide by rail. The industries comprise silver and 
copper smelting, brewing, sawmilling, ropemaking, flourmilling, 
sugar-refining and yacht-building. The harbour is protected 
by two forts known as the Fort Glanville batteries. The suburbs, 
which are connected with the town by tramways, are Alberton, 
Queenstown, Yatala, Rosewater and Kingston-on-the-Hill. 

PORTADOWN, a market town of county Armagh, Ireland, 
on the river Bann and the Great Northern railway, 25 m. 
W.S.W. of Belfast. Pop. (1901), 10,092. It is a junction of

lines from Dublin, Clones and Omagh. The Bann, which is 
connected with the Newry Canal and falls into Lough Neagh 

5 m. north of the town, is navigable for vessels of 90 tons burden. 
It is crossed at Port ado wn by a stone bridge of seven arches, 
originally built in 1764, but since then re-erected. The manu- 
facture of linen and cotton is carried on, and there is a con- 
siderable trade in pork, grain and farm produce. In the reign 
of Charles I. the manor was bestowed on John Obyns, who erected 
a mansion and a few houses, which were the beginning of the 
town. A grain-market was established in 1780. The town is 
governed by an urban district council. 

PORTAELS, JEAN FRANCOIS (1818-1895), Belgian painter, 
was born at Vilvorde (Brabant), -in Belgium, on the 30th of 
April 18 18. His father, a rich brewer, sent him to study in the 
Brussels Academy, and the director, Francois Navez, ere long 
received him as a pupil in his own studio. About 1841 Portaels 
went to Paris, where he was kindly received by Paul Delaroche. 
Having returned to Belgium, he carried off the Grand Prix de 
Rome in 1842. He then travelled through Italy, Greece, 
Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, the Lebanon, Judaea, Spain, Hungary 
and Norway. On his return to Belgium in 1847 Portaels 
succeeded H. Vanderhaert as director of the academy at Ghent. 
In 1849 he "married the daughter of his first master, Navez, 
and in 1850 settled at Brussels; but as he failed in obtaining the 
post of director of the academy there, and wished, nevertheless, 
to carry on the educational work begun by his father-in-law, 
he opened a private studio-school, which became of great 
importance in the development of Belgian art. He again 
made several journeys, spending some time in Morocco; he came 
back to Brussels in 1874, and in 1878 obtained the directorship 
of the academy which had so long been the object of his ambition. 
Portaels executed a vast number of works. Decorative paint- 
ings in the church of St Jacques-sur-Caudenberg; biblical 
scenes, such as " The Daughter of Sion Reviled " (in the Brussels 
Gallery), "The Death of Judas," "The Magi travelling to 
Bethlehem," " Judith's Prayer," and " The Drought in Judaea "; 
genre pictures, among which are "A Box in the Theatre at 
Budapest " (Brussels Gallery), portraits of officials and of the 
fashionable world, Oriental scenes and, above all, pictures of 
fancy female figures and of exotic life. " His works are in general 
full of a facile grace, of which he is perhaps too lavish," wrote 
Th6ophile Gautier. Yet his pleasing and abundant productions 
as a painter do not constitute Portaels's crowning merit. The 
high place his name will fill in the history of contemporary 
Belgian art is due to his influence as a learned and clear-sighted 
instructor, who formed, among many others, the painters E. 
Wauters and E. Agneesens, the sculptor Ch. van der Stappen, 
and the architect Licot. He died at Brussels on the 8th of 
February 1895.

PORTAGE, a city and the county-seat of Columbia county, 
Wisconsin, U.S.A., on the Wisconsin river, about 85 m. N.W. of 
Milwaukee. Pop. (1890) 5143; (1900) 5459, of whom 11 84 
were foreign-bora; (1910 U.S. census) 5440. It is served by 
the Chicago, Milwaukee & St Paul, and the Minneapolis, St Paul 

6 Sault Ste Marie railways. The city is situated at the west 
end of the government ship canal connecting the Fox and 
Wisconsin rivers, and river steamboats ply during the open 
season between Portage and Green Bay and intermediate points 
in the Fox River Valley, Portage being the head of navigation 
on the Fox. Portage is in the midst of a fertile farming region, 
and has a trade in farm and dairy products and tobacco. Its 
manufactures include brick, tile, lumber, flour, pickles, knit 
goods, steel tanks and marine engines and launches, and there 
are several tobacco warehouses and grain elevators. As the 
Fox and Wisconsin rivers are here only 2 m. apart, these rivers 
were the early means of communication between Lake Michigan 
and the Mississippi river. The first Europeans known to have 
visited the site of the city were Radisson and Groseilliers, who 
crossed the portage in 1655. The portage was used by Mar- 
quette and Joliet on their way to the Mississippi in 1673, and a 



red granite monument commemorates their passage. Aboi 
1712 the Fox Indians disputed the passage of the portage, 
precipitating hostilities which continued intermittently until 
1743. The first settler was Lawrence Barth, who engaged in 
the carrying trade here in 1793. Jacques Vieau established 
a trading post here in 1797, and by 1820 it was a thriving depot 
of the fur trade. During the Red Bird uprising (1827) a tei 
porary military post was established by Major William Whistli 
of the U.S. army. Fort Winnebago was begun in the following 
year, was remodelled and completed by Lieut. Jefferson Davis 
in 1832, and was subsequently abandoned. It was from 
there in the same year that the final and successful cam- 
paign against Black Hawk was begun. After several failures 
the Fox-Wisconsin canal was completed in 1856, and in June 
of that year the " Aquila," a stern-wheeler, passed through 
the canal on its way from Pittsburg to Green Bay. The 
shifting channel of the Wisconsin has retarded navigation, 
and the canal has never been as important commercially as 
was expected. 

PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE, a port of entry and the chief town 
of Portage la Prairie county, Manitoba, Canada, situated 50 m. 
W. of Winnipeg, on the Canadian Pacific and Canadian Northern 
railways, at an altitude of 854 ft. above the sea. Pop. (1901), 
3901. It is in the midst of a fine agricultural district, into which 
several branch railways extend, and carries on a large export 
trade in grain and other farm produce. 

PORTALEGRE, an episcopal city, capital of the district of 
Portalegre, Portugal; 8 m. N. of Portalegre station, on the 
Lisbon-Badajoz-Madrid railway. Pop. (1900), 11,820. Portal- 
egre is the Roman Amaea or Atnmaia, and numerous Roman and 
prehistoric remains have been discovered in the neighbourhood. 
The principal buildings are the cathedral, the ruined Moorish 
citadel and two more modern forts. The administrative 
districPof Portalegre, in which the rearing of swine, the pro- 
duction of grain, wine and oil, and the manufacture of woollen 
and cotton goods and corks are the principal industries, coincides 
with the' northern part of the ancient province of Alemtejo 
(?.r.).-^Pop. (1900), 124,443; area, 2405 sq. m. 

PORTALIS, JEAN fiTIENNE MARIE (1 746-1807), French 
jurist, came of a bourgeois family, and was born at Bausset in 
Provence on the 1st of April 1746. He was educated by the 
Oratorians at their schools in Toulon and Marseilles, and then 
went to the university of Aix; while a student there he published 
his first two works, Observations sur Emile in 1763 and Des 
Prijugts in 1764. In 1765 he became an avocat at the parlement 
of Aix, and soon obtained so great a reputation that he was in- 
structed by the due de Choiseul in 1770 to draw up the decree 
authorizing the marriage of Protestants. From 1778 to 1781 
he was one of the four assessors or administrators of Provence. 
In November 1793, after the republic had been proclaimed, he 
came to Paris and was thrown into prison, being the brother- 
in-law of Joseph Jerome Simeon, the leader of the Federalists 
in Provence. He was soon removed through the influence of 
B. de V. Barere to a tnaison de santi, where he remained till the 
fall of Robespierre. On being released he practised as a lawyer 
in Paris; and in 1795 he was elected by the capital to the Con- 
seil des Anciens, becoming a leader of the moderate party 
opposed to the directory. As a leader of the moderates he was 
proscribed at the coup d'itat of Fructidor, but, unlike General 
Charles Pichegru and the marquis de Barb6-Marbois, he managed 
to escape to Switzerland, and did not return till Bonaparte 
became First Consul. Bonaparte made him a conseiller d'&tat 
in 1800, and then charged him, with F, D. Tronchet, Bigot de 
Pr6ameneu, and Jacques de Maleville, to draw up the Code 
Civil. Of this commission he was the most industrious member, 
and many of the most important titles, notably those on mar- 
riage and heirship, are his work. In 1801 he was placed in 
charge of the department of cultes or public worship, and in 
that capacity had the chief share in drawing up the provisions 
of the Concordat. In 1803 he became a member of the Institute, 
in 1804 minister of public worship, and in 1805 a knight grand 
cross of the Legion of Honour. He soon after became totally

blind; and after an operation he died at Paris on the 25th of 
August 1807. 

The work of Portalis appears in the Code Napoleon, but see 
also Frederick Portalis's Documents, rapports, et travaux intdits 
sur It Code Civil (1844) and Sur le Concordat (1845); for his life, 
see the biography in the edition of his Oeuvres by F. Portalis 
(1S23) and Ren6 Lavolee, Portalis, sa vie et ses wuvres, (Paris, 
1869). 

His son, Joseph Marie Portalis (1778-1858), entered the 
diplomatic service, and obtaining the favour of Louis XVIII. 
filled many important offices. He was under-secretary of state 
for the ministry of justice, first president of the court of cassa- 
tion, minister for foreign affairs, and in 1851 a member of the 
senate. 

PORTARLINGTON, a market town situated partly in King's 
county but chiefly in Queen's county, Ireland, on both banks of 
the river Barrow, here the county boundary. Pop. (1901), 1943- 
The railway station, a mile south of the town, is an important 
junction, 42 m. west by south from Dublin, of the Great Southern 
& Western system, where the branch line to Athlone leaves 
the main line. Monthly fairs are held, and there is considerable 
local trade. After the revocation of the edict of Nantes a 
colony of French refugees was established here in the reign of 
William III., and the beautiful church of St Paul (rebuilt in 
1857) was devoted to their use, services being conducted in the 
French language, for which reason the church is still spoken of as 
the " French Church." The former name of the town was 
Cooltetoodera, but on the property passing into the hands of 
Lord Arlington in the reign of Charles II. the name was changed. 
Emo Park, 5 m. south of the town, is the fine demesne of the earls 
of Portarlington, a title granted to the family of Dawson in 1785. 
An obelisk on Spire Hill near the town is one of the many famine 
relief works in Ireland. On the river, close to the town, there 
are picturesque remains of Lea Castle, originally built c. 1260. 
Tortarlington was incorporated in 1667, and was a parliamentary 
borough both before the Union and after, its representation in 
the imperial parliament (by one member) being merged in 
that of the county by the Redistribution Act of 1885. 

PORT ARTHUR (formerly Prince Arthur's Landing), a 
town and harbour in Thunder Bay District, Ontario, Canada, 
on Lake Superior, and the Canadian Pacific, Grand Trunk 
Pacific, and Canadian Northern railways, and the lake terminus 
of the two latter. Pop. (1901), 3214. The lake terminus of 
the Canadian Pacific, originally here, has been moved to Fort 
William, 4 m. distant. Lumber and minerals are shipped from 
the surrounding district, and vast quantities of grain from the 
farther west. 

PORT ARTHUR (Chinese, Lu-shun-k'ou), a fortress situated 
at the extreme south of the peninsula of Liao-tung in the Chinese 
principality of Manchuria. It was formerly a Chinese naval 
arsenal and fortress, but was captured by the Japanese in 1894, 
who destroyed most of the defensive works. In 1898 it was 
leased to Russia with the neighbouring port of Talienwan, and 
was gradually converted into a Russian stronghold. In 1905 
the lease was transferred to Japan. The port or harbour is 
a natural one, entirely landlocked except to tbe south. The 
basin inside is of limited extent. Barren and rocky hills rise 
from the water's edge all round. A railway 270 m. long connects 
the port with Mukden and tbe trans-Siberian line; there is also 
railway connexion with Pekin. The harbour is ice-free all 
the year round, a feature in which it contrasts favourably with 
Vladivostok. 

The Liao-tung peninsula, separated from Korea by the Bay 
of Korea, and from the Chinese mainland by the Gulf of Liao-tung, 
runs in a south-westerly direction from the mainland of Manchuria, 
and is continued by a group of small islands which reach another 
peninsula projecting from the mainland of China in a north-easterly 
direction, and having at its north-eastern extremity the port of 
Wci-hai-wei. The Liao-tung peninsula is indented by several bays, 
two of which nearly meet, making an isthmus less than 2 m. wide, 
beyond which the peninsula slightly widens again, this part of it 
having the name of Kan-tun (regent's sword). Two wide bays 
open on the eastern shore of the latter: Lu-shun-k'ou (Port Arthur) 
and Talienwan. Both were leased to Russia. Lu-shun-k'ou Bay 



is nearly 4 m. long and ii m. wide, the entrance being only 350 yds. 
wide. The Chinese deepened the bay artificially and erected quays. 
The roadstead is exposed to south-easterly winds, and in this respect 
the wider Bay of Talienwan is safer. Coal is found near to the port. 
The climate is very mild, and similar to that of south Crimea, only 
moisten 

While in occupation by the Russians Port Arthur became 
Europeanized. The military port, Tairen, is a few miles to the 
north. During the Russo-Japanese war the Japanese assailed 
Port Arthur both by land and sea and, after repeated assaults, 
on the 1st of January 1905, General Stoessel surrendered the 
citadel into the hands of the Japanese. 

PORTAS, or Portuary, a breviary (q.v.) of such convenient 
size that it could be carried on the person, whence its Latin 
name porttforium (portare, to carry, forts, out of doors, abroad). 
The English word was adapted from the Old French portehors, 
and took a large number of forms, e.g. porthors, porteous, portes, 
&c. In Scots law, the " porteous-roll " was the name given 
formerly to a list of criminals drawn up by the justice-clerk on 
information given by the local authorities, together with the 
names of witnesses, and charges made. 

PORTATIVE ORGAN, a small medieval organ carried by the 
performer, who manipulated the bellows with one hand and 
fingered the keys with the other. This small instrument was 
necessarily made as simple as possible. On a small rectangular 
wind chest or reservoir, fed by means of a single bellows placed 
at the back, in front, or at the right side, were arranged the pipes 
— one, two or three to a note — supported by more or less orna- 
mental uprights and an oblique bar. The most primitive style 
of keyboard consisted merely of sliders pushed in to make the 
note sound and restored to their normal position by a horn spring; 
the reverse action was also in use, the keys being furnished with 
knobs or handles. 

Towards the middle of the 13th century the portatives repre- 
sented in the miniatures of illuminated MSS. first show signs of a real 
keyboard with balanced keys, as in the 13th century Spanish MS., 
known as the Cantigas de Santa Maria, 1 containing four full pages 
of miniatures of instrumentalists, fifty-one in number. From 
the position of the performer's thumb it is evident that the keys are 
pressed down to make the notes sound. There are nine pipes and 
the same number of keys, sufficient for the diatonic octave of C 
major with the B fiat added. The pipes put into these small organs 
were flue pipes, their intonation must have been very unstable 
owing to the irregularity of the wind supply fed by a single bellows, 
the pressure being at the mercy of the performer's hand. Increased 
pressure in pines with fixed mouthpieces, such as organ pipes, 
produces a rise in pitch. These medieval portative organs, so exten- 
sively used during the 14th and 15th centuries, were revivals of 
those used by the Romans, of which a specimen excavated at Pompeii 
in 1876 is preserved in the Museum at Naples. The case measures 
14 J in. by 9 J in. and contains nine pipes, of which the longest measures 
but 9} in.; six of the pipes have oblong holes at a snort distance 
from the top similar to thosemade in eamba pipes of modern organs 
to give them their reedy quality, and also to those cut in the bamboo 
pipes of the Chinese Cheng, which is a primitive organ furnished 
with free reeds. From the description of these remains by C. F. 
Abdy Williams, 4 it would seem that a bronze plate 11 J in. by 2f in. 
having 18 rectangular slits arranged in three rows to form Vandykes 
was found inside the case, with three little plates of bronze just wide 
enough to pass through the slits lying by it ; this plate possibly formed 
part of the mechanism for the sliders of the keys. The small 
instrument often taken for a syrinx on a contorniate of Sallust 
in the Cabinet Imperial de France in Paris may be meant for a 
miniature portative. (K. S.) 

PORT AUGUSTA, a seaport of Frome county, South Australia, 
on the east shore of Spencer Gulf, 259 m. by rail N.N.W. of 
Adelaide. Pop. about 2400. It has a fine natural deep and 
landlocked harbour, and the government wharves have berthing 
for large vessels. The chief exports are wool, wheat, flour, 
copper, hides and tallow. Port Augusta is the seat of a Roman 
Catholic bishop and has a cathedral, while its town-hall is the 
finest in the state, that of Adelaide excepted. It is also the start- 
ing point of the Great Northern railway. The largest ostrich 
farm in Australia lies 8 m. from the town. The neighbourhood 
is rich in minerals, copper, silver, iron and coal have been found,

and in 1900 valuable gold quartz reefs were discovered at 
Tarcoola. 

PORT AU PRINCE (originally L'Hdpital, and for brief periods 
Port Henri and Port Ripublicain), the capital of the republic of 
Haiti, West Indies, situated at the apex of the triangular bay 
which strikes inland for about 100 m. between the two great 
peninsulas of the west coast, with its upper recesses protected by 
the beautiful island of Gonaives (30 m. long by 2 broad). The 
city is admirably situated on ground that soon begins to rise 
rapidly towards the hills. It was originally laid out by the 
French on a regular plan with streets of good width running 
north and south and intersected by others at right angles. 
Everything has been allowed to fall into disorder and disrepair, 
and to this its public buildings form no exception. Every few 
years whole quarters of the town are burned down, but the 
people go on building the same slight wooden houses, with only 
here and there a more substantial warehouse in brick. In spite 
of the old French aqueduct the water-supply is defective. 
From June to September the heat is excessive, reaching 95 to 99 
F. in the shade. The population, mostly negroes and mulat- 
toes, is estimated at 61,000. Port au Prince was first laid out 
by M. de la Cuza in 1749. In 1751, and again in 1770, it was 
destroyed by earthquakes. 

PORT BLAIR, the chief place in the convict settlement of 
the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean, situated on the 
south-east shore of the South Andaman Island, in n° 42' N., 
93 E. It derives its name from Lieut. Blair, R.N., who first 
occupied it in 1789, as a station for the suppression of piracy 
and the protection of shipwrecked crews. Abandoned on 
account of sickness in 1796, it was not again occupied until 1856. 
It possesses one of the best harbours in Asia, while its central 
position in the Bay of Bengal gives it immense advantage as a 
place of naval rendezvous. (See Andaman Islands.) 

PORT CHESTER, a village of Westchester county, New York, 
U.S.A., in the south-east part of the state, on Long Island Sound, 
and about 10 m. N.E. of New York City (26 m. from the Grand 
Central Station) . Pop. ( 1 900) , 7440, of whom 2 1 1 o were 
foreign-born; (1910 census), 12,809. It is served by the New 
York, New Haven & Hartford railroad, and by daily steamers 
to and from New York City. The village is a summer resort as 
well as a suburban residential district for New York City. 
Among its public institutions are a library, a park and a hospital. 
The village has various manufactures, including bolts and nuts, 
motors for racing boats and automobiles; there are also large 
planing and wood-moulding mills. The earliest mention of 
Port Chester in any extant record is in the year 1732. Until 
1837 it was known as Saw Pit, on account of a portion of 
the village, it is said, being used as a place for building boats. 
During the War of Independence the village was frequently 
occupied by detachments of American troops. Port Chester 
was incorporated as a village in 1868. 

PORTCULLIS (from the Fr. porte-coulisse, porte, a gate, 
Lat. porta, and coulisse, a groove, used adjectivally for " sliding," 
from couler, to slide or glide, Lat. colare; the Fr. equivalents 
are herse, a harrow, and coulisse; Ger. Fallgatter; Ital. 
saracinesca), a strong-framed grating of oak, the lower points 
shod with iron, and sometimes entirely made of metal, hung so 
as to slide up and down in grooves with counterbalances, and 
intended to protect the gateways of castles, &c. The defenders 
having opened the gates and lowered the [portcullis, could send 
arrows and darts through the gratings. A portcullis was in 
existence until modern times in a gateway at York. The Romans 
used the portcullis in the defence of gateways. It was called 
cataracta from the Gr. KarappaKr^s, a waterfall (KaTappnyvvaBaL, 
to fall down). Vegetius (De re milit, iv. 4) speaks of it as an old 
means of defence, and it has been suggested that in Psalm xxiv. 
7, 9, " Lift up your heads, oh ye gates," &c, there is an allusion 
to a similar contrivance. Remains of a cataracta are clearly 
seen in the gateway of Pompeii. The Italian name saracinesca 
originates from the crusades. (See Gate.) 

PORTE, THE SUBLIME (Arab, babi-'ali, the high gate, 
through the French translation la sublime porte), in Turkey, the 



official name for the government, derived from the high gate 
giving access to the building where the offices of the principal 
state departments are situated. 

PORT ELIZABETH, a seaport of the Cape province, South 
Africa, in Algoa Bay, by which name the port is often designated. 
It lies in 35 57' S., 25 37' E. on the east side of Cape Recife, 
being by sea 436 m. from Cape Town and 384 m. from Durban. 
In size and importance it is second only to Cape Town among the 
towns of the province. It is built partly along the seashore and 
partly on the slopes and top of the hills that rise some 200 ft 
above the bay. The Baaken's River, usually a small stream 
but subject (as in 1908) to disastrous floods, runs through thi 
town, which consists of four divisions; the harbour and busi 
ness quarter at the foot of the cliffs, the upper part, a flat 
table-land known as " The Hill "; " The Valley " formed by the 
Baaken's River; and " South Hill," east of the river. 

The Town, — Jetty Street leads from the north jetty to the market 
square, in or around which are grouped the chief public buildings 
— the town-hall, court-house, post office, market buildings, public 
library, St Mary's church (Anglican) and St Augustine's (Roman 
Catholic)^ Several of these buildings are of considerable architec- 
tural merit and fine elevation. The library, of Elizabethan design, 
contains some 45,000 volumes. The market buildings, at the 
south-east corner of the square, and partly excavated from the sides 
of the cliff, contain large halls for the fruit, wool and feather markets 
and the museum. Feather-Market Hall, where are held the sales 
of ostrich feathers, seats 5000 persons. The museum has valuable 
ethnographical and zoological collections. Other public buildings 
include a synagogue and a Hindu temple. Leading west from Market 
Square is Main Street, in which are the principal business houses. 
Between Main Street and the sea is Strand Street, also a busy 
commercial thoroughfare. Behind the lower town streets rise in 
terraces to " The Hill," a residential district. Here is an open plot 
of ground, Donkin Reserve, containing the lighthouse and a stone 
pyramid with^ an inscription in memory of Elizabeth, wife of Sir 
Rufane Donkin, described as " one of the most perfect of human 
beings, who has given her name to the town below." A fountain, 
surmounted by the statue of a war-horse, erected by public sub- 
scription in 1905 commemorates " the services of the gallant animals 
which perished in the Anglo-Boer war, 1890^1902." Farther west 
is a large hospital, one of the finest institutions of its kind in 
South Africa. At the southern end of The Hill is St George's Park, 
which has some fine trees, in marked contrast to the general treeless, 
barren aspect of the town. Port Elizabeth indeed possesses few 
natural amenities, but its golf links are reputed the finest in 
South Africa. The town, apart from its transit trade and the 
industries connected therewith, has some ^manufactures — jam and 
confectionery works; oil, candle and explosive works; saw and flour 
mills; tanneries, &c. It has an excellent water supply. 

The Harbour, — There is no enclosed basin, but the roadstead has 
excellent holding ground, protected from all winds except the south- 
east, the prevailing wind being westerly. No harbour or light dues 
are charged to vessels of any flag. The port has three jetties of 
wrought iron, respectively 1162, 1152 and 1462 ft. in length, extend- 
ing to the four fathoms line. These jetties are provided with 
hydraulic cranes, &c, and railways connect them with the main 
line, so that goods can be sent direct from the jetties to every part 
of South Africa. In favourable weather vessels drawing up to 21 ft. 
can discharge cargo alongside the jetties. In unfavourable condi- 
tions and for larger steamers tugs and lighters are employed. Rough 
weather prevents discharge of cargo by lighters, on an average, seven 
days in the year. The customs-house and principal railway station 
are close to the north jetty. The port is state owned, and is under 
the administration of the harbour and railway board of the Union. 

Trade. — Port Elizabeth has a large import trade, chiefly in textiles, 
machinery, hardware, apparel and provisions, supplying to a con- 
siderable extent the markets of Kimberley, Rhodesia, the Orange 
Free State and the Transvaal. The exports are mainly the pro- 
ducts of the eastern part of the Cape province, the most important 
being ostrich feathers, wool and mohair. Skins, hides and maize 
are also exported. In 1855 the value of the imports was £376,000; 
in 1883 £2,364,000; in 1898 £6,248,000; in 1903 £10,137,000. 
Depression in trade brought down the imports in 1904 to £6,855,000. 
In 1906 they were £6,564,000 and in 1907 £6,004,000. The export 
trade has been of slower but more steady growth. It was valued 
at £584,000 in 1855, at £2,341,000 in 1883, £2,103,000 in 1898, 
£2,010,000 in 1903. Indicative of the fact that the agricultural 
community was little affected by the trade depression are the export 
figures for 1904 and 1906, which were £2,044,000 and £2,627,000 
respectively. In 1907 goods valued at £3,150,000 were exported. 

Population. — The population within the municipal area was at the 
1904 census 32,959; that within the district of Port Elizabeth 46,626* 
of whom 23,782 were whites. Many of the inhabitants are of German 
origin and the Deutsche Liedertafel is one of the most popular clubs 
in the town.

History. — Algoa Bay was discovered by Bartholomew Diaz in 
1488, and was by him named Bahia da Roca, probably with 
reference to the rocky islet in the bay, on which he is stated to 
have erected a cross (St Croix Island). After the middle of the 
16th century the bay was called by the Portuguese Bahia da 
Lagoa, whence its modern designation. In 1754 the Dutch 
settlements at the Cape were extended eastwards as far as 
Algoa Bay. The convenience of reaching the eastern district 
by boat was then recognized and advantage taken of the road- 
stead sheltered by Cape Recife. In 1799, during the first 
occupation of Cape Colony by the British, Colonel (afterwards 
General Sir John) Vandeleur, to guard the roadstead, built a small 
fort on the hill west of the Baaken's River. It was named Fort 
Frederick in honour of the then duke of York, and is still preserved. 
A few houses grew up round the fort, and in 1820 besides the 
military there was a civilian population at Fort Frederick of 
about 35 persons. In April of that year arrived in the bay the 
first of some 4000 British immigrants, who settled in the eastern 
district of the colony (See Cape Colony: History), Under the 
supervision of Sir Rufane Donkin, acting governor of the Cape, a 
town was laid out at the base of the hills. In 1836 it was made a 
free warehousing port, and in 1837 the capital of a small adjacent 
district. To overcome the difficulty of landing from the road- 
stead a breakwater was built at the mouth of the Baakens River 
in 1856, but it had to be removed in 1869, as it caused a serious 
accumulation of sand. The prosperity which followed the 
construction of railways to the interior earned for the port the 
designation of " the Liverpool of South Africa." Railway 
work was begun in 1873 and Port Elizabeth is now in direct 
communication with all other parts of South Africa. At the 
same period (1873) the building of the existing jetties was 
undertaken. Port Elizabeth has possessed municipal govern- 
ment since 1836. Its predominant British character is shown 
by the fact that not until 1909 was the foundation stone laid 
of the first Dutch Reformed Church in the town. 

PORTEOUS, JOHN (d. 1736), captain of 'the city guard of 
Edinburgh, whose name is associated with the celebrated riots 
of 1 736, was the son of Stephen Porteous, an Edinburgh tailor. 
Having served in the army, he was employed in 1 715 to drill the 
city guard for the defence of Edinburgh in anticipation of a 
Jacobite rising, and was promoted later to the command of the 
force. In 1736 a smuggler named Wilson, who had won popu- 
larity by helping a companion to escape from the Tolbooth 
prison, was hanged; and, some slight disturbance occurring at the 
execution, the city guard fired on the mob, killing a few and 
wounding a considerable number of persons. Porteous, who was 
said to have fired at the people with his own hand, was brought 
to trial and sentenced to death. The granting of a reprieve was 
hotly resented by the people of Edinburgh, and on the night of 
the 7th of September 1736 an armed body of men in disguise 
broke into the prison, seized Porteous, and hanged him oh a 
signpost in the street. It was said tKat persons of high position 
were concerned in the crime; but although the government 
offered rewards for the apprehension of the perpetrators, and 
although General Moyle wrote to the duke of Newcastle that the 
criminals were " well-known by many of the inhabitants of the 
town," no one was ever convicted of participation in the murder. 
The sympathies of the people, and even, it is said, of the clergy, 
throughout Scotland, were so unmistakably on the side of the 
rioters that the original stringency of the bill introduced into 
parliament for the punishment of the city of Edinburgh had to 
be reduced to the levying of a fine of £2000 for Porteous's 
widow, and the disqualification of the provost for holding any 
public office. The incident of the Porteous riots was used by Sir 
Walter Scott in The Heart of Midlothian.

PORTER, BENJAMIN CURTIS (1843- ), American artist, 
was born at Melrose, Massachusetts, on the 27th of August 1843. 
He was a pupil of A. H. Bicknell and of the Paris schools, and 
was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design, 
New York, in 1878, and a full academician in 18S0. He is best 
known as a painter of portraits. 

PORTER, DAVID (1780-1843), American naval officer, was 
born in Boston, Massachusetts, on the 1st of February 1780. 
His father, David, and his uncle, Samuel, commanded American 
ships in the War of Independence. In 1796 he accompanied 
his father to the West Indies; on a second and on a third voyage 
he was impressed on British vessels, from which, however, he 
escaped. He became a midshipman in the United States Navy 
in April 1798; served on the " Constellation " (Captain Thomas 
Truxton) and was midshipman of the foretop when the " Constel- 
lation " defeated the " Insurgente "; was promoted lieutenant 
in October 1799, and was in four successful actions with French 
ships in this year. In 1803, during the war with Tripoli, he was 
first lieutenant of the " Philadelphia " when that vessel grounded, 
was taken prisoner, and was not released until June 1805. He 
was commissioned master commandant in April 1806; in 1807- 
1810 served about New Orleans 1 , where he captured several 
French privateers, and in 1812 was promoted' captain. He 
commanded the frigate " Essex " in her famous voyage in 1812- 
1814. In the Atlantic he captured seven brigs, one ship, on the 
13th of August 1812, the sloop "Alert," the first British war 
vessel taken in the War of 181 2. Without orders from his 
superiors he then (February 1813) rounded Cape Horn, the 
harbours of the east coast of South America being closed to 
him. In the South Pacific he captured many British whalers 
(the British losses were estimated at £500,000), and on his own 
authority took formal possession (November 1813) of Nuka- 
hivah, the largest of the Marquesas Islands; the United States, 
however, never asserted any claim to the island, which in 1842, 
with the other Marquesas, was annexed by France. During 
most of February and March 18 14 he was blockaded by the 
British frigates " Cherub " and " Phoebe " in the harbour of 
Valparaiso, and on the 28th of March was defeated by these 
vessels, which seem to have violated the neutrality of the port. 
He was released on parole, and sailed for New York on the " Essex, 
Jr.," a small vessel which he had captured from the British, 
and which accompanied the " Essex." At Sandy Hook he was 
detained by the captain of the British ship-of-war " Saturn " 
(who declared that Porter's parole was no longer effective), but 
escaped in a small boat. He was a member of the new board of 
naval commissioners from 181 5 until 1823, when he commanded 
a squadron sent to the West Indies to suppress piracy. One 
of his officers, who landed at Fajardo (or Foxardo), Porto Rico, • 
in pursuit of a pirate, was imprisoned by the Spanish authorities 
on the charge of piracy. Porter, without reporting the incident 
or awaiting instructions, forced the authorities to apologize. 
He was recalled (December 1824), was court-martialled, and was 
suspended for six months. In August 1826 he resigned his 
commission, and until 1829 was commander-in-chief of the 
Mexican navy, then fighting Spain; in payment for his services 
he received government land in Tehuantepec, where he hoped to 
promote an inter-oceanic canal. President Andrew Jackson 
appointed him consul-general to Algiers in 1830, and in 183 1 
created for him the post of charge d'affaires at Constantinople, 
where in 1841 he became minister. He died in Pera on the 3rd of 
March 1843. 

He wrote a Journal of a Cruise nxadt to the Pacific Ocean in the 
U.S. Frigate " Essex " in 1812-13-14 (2 vols., 1815; 2nd ed., 1822), 
and Constantinople and its Environs (2 vols., 1835), a valuable 
guide-book. See the Memoir of Commodore David Porter (Albany, 
New York, 1875), by his son, Admiral David D. Porter. 

PORTER, DAVID DIXON (1813-1891), American naval 
officer, son of Captain David Porter, was born in Chester, Pennsyl- 
vania, on the 8th of June 1813. His first voyage, with his father 

1 While he was in New Orleans he adopted David Farragut, who 
later served with Trim on the " Essex."

in West Indian waters in 1823-1824, was terminated by the 
Fajardo affair (see Porter, David). In April 1826 he entered 
the Mexican navy, of which his father was commander-in-chief, 
and which he left in 1828, after the capture by the Spanish of the 
" Guerrero," on which be was serving under his cousin, David H. 
Porter (1804-1828), who was killed before the ship's surrender. 
He became a midshipman in the United States navy in 1829, 
and was in the coast survey in 1836-1842. In 1839 he married 
the daughter of Captain Daniel Tod Patterson (1786-1839), then 
commandant of the Washington navy-yard. Porter became a 
lieutenant in February 1841; served at the naval observatory 
in 1845-1846; in 1846 he was sent to the Dominican Republic to 
report on conditions there. During the Mexican War he served, 
from February to June 1847, as lieutenant and then as command- 
ing officer of the " Spitfire," a paddle vessel built for use on the 
rivers, and took part in the bombardment of Vera Cruz and in 
the other naval operations under Commander M. C. Perry. From 
the close of the Mexican War to the beginning of the Civil War 
he had little but detail duty; in 1855 and again in 1856 he made 
trips to the Mediterranean to bring to the United States camels 
for army use in the south-west. In April 1861 he was assigned 
to the " Powhatan," and was sent under secret orders from the 
president for the relief of Fort Pickens, Pensacola, an expedition 
which he had urged. Porter was promoted commander on the 
22nd of April, and on the 30th of May was sent to blockade the 
South- West Pass of the Mississippi. In August he left the gulf in 
a fruitless search for the Confederate cruiser " Sumter." Upon 
his return to New York in November he urged an expedition 
against New Orleans (q.v.) t and recommended the appointment 
of Commander D. G. Farragut (?.».), his foster-brother, to the 
chief command. In the expedition Porter himself commanded 
the mortar flotilla, which, when Farragut's fleet passed the forts 
on the early morning of the 24th of April 1862, covered its 
passage by a terrific bombardment that neutralized the fire of 
Fort Jackson. At Vicksburg Porter's bombardment assisted 
Farragut to run past the forts (June 28). On the 9th of July 
Porter was ordered, with ten mortar boats, to the James river, 
where McClellan's army was concentrated. On the 15th of 
October he took command of the gun-vessels which had been 
built on the upper waters of the Mississippi, and to which he 
made important additions at an improvised navy-yard at 
Mound City, Illinois. With this he took part in the capture 
of Arkansas Post on the nth of January 1863. In the opera- 
tions for the capture of Vicksburg in 1863 unsuccessful attempts 
were made in February and March by Porter's vessels to 
penetrate through connecting streams and bayous to the 
Yazoo river and reach the right rear of the Confederate 
defences on the bluffs. But in May the fleet ran past the 
Vicksburg batteries, mastered the Confederate forts at Grand 
" Gulf, and made it possible for Grant's army to undertake the 
brilliant campaign which led to the fall of the place (see 
American Civil War and Vicksburg). Porter received the 
thanks of Congress for " opening the Mississippi River " and was 
promoted rear-admiral. He co-operated with Major-General 
N. P. Banks in the Red River expeditions in March-May 1864, 
in which his gun-boats, held above Alexandria by shallow water 
and rapids, narrowly escaped isolation, being enabled to return 
only by the help qf a dam built by Lieut.-Colonel (Brigadier- 
General) Joseph Bailey (1827-1867). On the 12th of October 
1864 he assumed command of the North Atlantic blockading 
squadron, then about to engage in a combined military and naval 
expedition against Fort Fisher, North Carolina. Porter claimed 
that his guns silenced Fort Fisher, but Major-General B. F. Butler, 
in command of the land forces, refused to assault, asserting that 
the fort was practically intact. After Butler's removal, Porter, 
co-operating with Major-General Alfred H. Terry, and com- 
manding the largest fleet assembled at any one point during 
the war, took the fort on the 15th of January 1865; for this he 
again received the thanks of Congress. From 1865 to 1869 he 
was superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, 
which he greatly improved; his most notable change being the 
introduction of athletics. On the 25th of July he became 



vice-admiral. From the 9th of March to the 25th of Ji 
1869, while Adolph E. Borie (1809-1880), of Pennsylvania, w; 
secretary of the navy in President Grant's cabinet, Porter w; 
virtually in charge of the navy department. In 1870 hi 
succeeded Farragut in the grade of admiral, which lapse 
after Porter's death until 1899, when it was re-established to 
reward Rear-Admiral George Dewey for his victory at Manila 
Porter urged the reconstruction of the navy, which he sa 
begun in 1882. He died in Washington, D.C., on the 13th 
February 1891. 

Porter wrote a Life of Commodore David Porter (1875), gossip 
Incidents and Anecdotes of the Civil War (1885), a none too accurat 
History of the Navy during the War of the Rebellion (1887), two novel 
Allan Dare and Robert le Diable (1885; dramatized, 1887) and Han 
Marline (1886), and a short " Romance of Gettysburg," published 
The Criterion in 1903. See J. R. Soley, Admiral Porter (New York, 
1903) in the " Great Commanders " Series. 

Admiral Porter's, three brothers were in the service of the 
United States: William David Porter (1800-1864) entered 
the navy in 1823, commanded the " Essex " on the Tennessee 
and the Mississippi in the Civil War, and became commodore in 
July 1862; Theodoric Henry Porter (1817-1846) was the first 
officer of the American army killed in the Mexican War; and 
Henry Ogden Porter (1 823-1 872) resigned from the United 
States navy in 1847, after seven years' service, fought under 
William Walker in Central America, returned to the American 
navy, was executive officer of the " Hatteras " when she was 
sunk by the " Alabama," and received wounds in the action from 
the effects of which he died several years later. 

PORTER, ENDYMION (1587-1649), English royalist, de- 
scended from Sir William Porter, sergeant-at-arms to Henry VII., 
and son of Edmund Porter, of Aston-sub-Edge in 'Gloucester- 
shire, by his cousin Angela, daughter of Giles Porter of Mickleto 
in the same county, was brought up in Spain — where he hai 
relatives — as page in the household of Olivares. He afterwards 
entered successively the service of Edward Villiers and of Buck- 
ingham, and through the latter's recommendation became groom 
of the bedchamber to Charles I. In October 1622 he was sent 
to negotiate concerning the affairs of the Palatinate and the 
marriage with the Infanta. He accompanied Charles and 
Buckingham on their foolhardy expedition in 1623, acted as 
their interpreter, and was included in the consequent attack 
made by Lord Bristol on Buckingham in 1626. In 1628 he was 
employed as envoy to Spain to negotiate for peace, and in 1634 
on a mission to the Netherlands to the Infante Ferdinand. 
During the Civil War Porter remained a constant and faithful 
servant of the king. He was with him during the two Scottish 
campaigns, attended him again on the visit to Scotland in August 
1 64 1, and followed Charles on his last departure from London 
in 1642, receiving the nominal command of a regiment, and sitting 
in the Royalist parliament at Oxford in 1643. He had, however, 
little faith in the king's measures. " His Majesty's businesses," 
he writes in 1641, " run in their wonted channel — subtle designs 
of gaining the popular opinion and weak executions for the up- 
holding of monarchy." His fidelity to Charles was of a personal, 
not of a political nature. " My duty and loyalty have taught 
me to follow my king," he declares, " and by the grace of God 
nothing shall divert me from it." This devotion to the king, 
the fact that he was the agent and protege of Buckingham, and 
that his wife Olivia, daughter of John, Lord Boteler of Bramfield, 
and niece of Buckingham, was a zealous Roman Catholic, drew 
upon him the hostility of the opposite faction. As member of 
the Long Parliament, in which he sat as member for Droitwich, 
he was one of the minority of 59 who voted against Strafford's 
attainder, and was in consequence proclaimed a " betrayer of 
his country." On the 15th of February 1642 he was voted 
one of the dangerous counsellors, and specially excepted from 
pardon on the 4th of October and in the treaties of peace 
negotiated subsequently, while on the 10th of March 1643 he 
was excluded from parliament. Porter was also implicated in 
the army plot; he assisted Glamorgan in illegally putting the 
great seal to the commission to negotiate with the Irish in 1644; 
and was charged with having in the same manner affixed the

n 5 



great seal of Scotland, then temporarily in his keeping, to that of 
O'Neill in 1641, and of having incurred some responsibility for 
the Irish rebellion. Towards the end of 1645, when the king's 
cause was finally lost, Porter abandoned England, and resided 
successively in France, Brussels, where he was reduced to great 
poverty, and the Netherlands. The property which he had 
accumulated during the tenure of his various appointments, by 
successful commercial undertakings and by favours of the court, 
was now for the most part either confiscated or encumbered. 
He returned to England in 1649, after the king's death, and was 
allowed to compound for what remained of it. He died shortly 
afterwards, and was buried on the 20th of August 1649 a t St 
Martin's-in-the-Fields, leaving as a special charge in his will to 
his sons and descendants to " observe and respect the family of 
my Lord Duke of Buckingham, deceased, to whom I owe all the 
happiness I had in the world." He left five sons, who all played 
conspicuous, if not all creditable, parts in the history of the time. 
According to Wood, Porter was " beloved by two kings: James I. 
for his admirable wit and Charles I. for his general bearing, 
brave style, sweet temper, great experience, travels and modern 
languages." During the period of his prosperity Porter had 
gained a great reputation in the world of art and letters. He 
wrote verses, was a generous patron of Davenant, who especially 
sings his praises, of Dekker, Warmstrey, May, Herrick and 
Robert Dover, and was included among the 84 " essentials " 
in Bolton's " Academy Royal." He was a judicious collector 
of pictures, and as the friend of Rubens, Van Dyck, Mytens and 
other painters, and as agent for Charles in his purchases abroad 
he had a considerable share in forming the king's magnificent 
collection. He was also instrumental in procuring the Arundel 
pictures from Spain. The authorship of Ettc&v xion), 1649, a 
vindication of the Ebc&v paatXucfi, has been attributed with some 
reason to Porter.

PORTER, FITZ-JOHN (1822-1901), American soldier, was 
born at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the 31st of August 
1822. He was the son of a naval officer, and nephew of 
David Porter of the frigate " Essex." He graduated at the 
United States Military Academy in 1845 and was assigned 
to the artillery. In the Mexican War he won two brevets 
for gallantry— that of captain for Molino del Rey and that of 
major for Chapultepec. He served at West Point as instructor 
and adjutant (1840-1855), and he took part in the Utah 
expedition. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 he 
was employed on staff duties in the eastern states, and 
rendered great assistance in the organization of Pennsylvanian 
volunteers. In the absence of higher authority Porter sanctioned 
on hip own responsibility the request of Missouri Unionists for 
permission to raise troops, a step which had an important 
influence upon the struggle for the possession of the state. 
He became colonel of a new regiment of regulars on the 14th 
of May, and soon afterwards brigadier-general of volunteers. 
Under McCIellan he commanded a division of infantry in the 
Peninsular campaign, and directed the Union siege operations 
against Yorktown, and he was soon afterwards placed in com- 
mand of the V. army corps. When the Seven Days' battle (q.v.) 
began Porter's corps had to sustain alone the full weight of the 
Confederate attack, and though defeated in the desperately 
fought battle of Gaines's Mill (June 27, 1862) the steadiness 
of his defence was so conspicuous that he was immediately 



promoted major-general of volunteers and brevet brigadier- 
general U.S.A. His corps, moreover, had the greatest share in 
the successful battles of Glendale and Malvern Hill. Soon after- 
wards, with other units of the Army of the Potomac, the V. corps 
was sent to reinforce Pope in central Virginia. Its inaction on 
the first day of the disastrous second battle of Bull Run (q.v.) 
led to the general's subsequent disgrace; but it made a splendid 
fight on the second day to save the army from complete rout, 
and subsequently shared in the Antietam campaign. On the 
same day on which McCIellan was relieved from his command, 
Porter, his warm friend and supporter, was suspended. A few 
days later he was tried by court-martial on charges brought • 
against him by Pope, and on the 21st of January 1863 was 
sentenced to be cashiered " and for ever disqualified from holding 
any office of trust under the government of the United States." 
After many years Porter's friends succeeded (1878) in procuring 
a revision of the case by a board of distinguished general officers. 
This board reported strongly in Porter's favour, but at the 
time the remission of the disqualifying penalty was all that was 
obtained in the way of redress. General Grant had now taken 
Porter's part, and wrote an article in vol. 135 of the North 
American Review entitled " An Undeserved Stigma." Against 
much opposition, partly political (18 70-1 886) and a veto on a legal 
point from President Arthur, a relief bill finally passed Congress, 
and Porter was on the 5th of August 1886 restored to the United 
States army as colonel and placed on the retired list, no provision, 
however, being made for compensation. After the Civil War 
General Porter was engaged in business in New York, and later 
held successively many important municipal offices. In 1869 
he declined the offer made by the khedive of the chief command 
of the Egyptian army. He died on the 21st of May 1901, at 
Morristown, New Jersey.

PORTER, HENRY (fl. 1 596-1599), English dramatist, author 
of The Two Angry Women of Abingdon, may probably be identified 
with the Henry Porter who matriculated at Brasenose College, 
Oxford, on the 19th of June 1589, and is described as aged 
sixteen and the son of a gentleman of London. From 1596 to 
1599 he was engaged in writing plays for Henslowe for the 
admiral's men, and his closest associate seems to have been 
Henry Chettle. The earlier entries in Henslowe's Diary are 
respectful in tone, and the considerable sums paid to " Mr Porter" 
prove that his plays w T ere popular. Henslowe secured in February 
1599 the sole rights of any play in which Porter had a hand, 
the consideration being an advance of forty shillings. As time 
goes on he is familiarly referred to as " Harry Porter "; his 
borrowings become more frequent, and the sums less, until on 
the 1 6th of April 1599 he obtained a loan of twelve pence in 
exchange for a bond to pay all he owed to Henslowe — twenty- 
five shillings — on pain of forfeiting ten pounds. Whether he 
paid or not does not appear, but his last loan is recorded on the 
26th of May 1599, after which nothing further is known of him. 
It seems in the highest degree unlikely that he is the Henry 
Porter who took his degree as Mus. Bac. at Christ Church in 1600 
after twelve years' study, and whose skill in sacred music is cele- 
brated in an epigram by John Weever. The entries in Henslowe's 
Diary indicate that he wrote a play called Love Prevented (1598), 
Hot Anger soon Cold, with Chettle and Ben Jonson (1598), the 
second part of The Two Angry Women of Abingdon (1598), The 
Four Merry Women of Abingdon (1599), and The Spencers (1599), 
with Chettle. None of these are extant, unless, as has been 
suggested, Love Prevented is another name for The Pleasant 
History of the two angry women of Abingdon. With the humorous 
mirth of Dick Coomes and Nicholas Proverbes, two serving men 
(1599), the importance of 'which is well described by Professor 
Gayley: " As a comedy of unadulterated native flavour, breath- 
ing rural life and manners and the modern spirit, constructed 
with knowledge of the stage, and without affectation or

constraint, it has no foregoing analogue except perhaps The 
Pinner of Wakefield. No play preceding or contemporary yields 
an easier conversational prose, not even the Merry Wives" 

Alexander Dyce edited the Angry Women for the Percy Society 
in 1841 ; and it is included in W. C. Hazlitt's edition of Dodsley'd 
Old Plays (187A). It was edited by Havelock Ellis in Nero and other 
plays (1888, il Mermaid Series, ) and in Representative English 
Comedies (1903)1 with an introduction by the general editor, Professor 
C. M. Gayley. 

PORTER, HORACE (1837- ), American diplomatist and 
soldier, was born in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, on the 15th of 
April 1837; son of David Rittenhouse Porter (1 788-1 867), 
governor of Pennsylvania in 1839-1845, and grandson of Andrew 
Porter (1743-1813), an officer in the Continental Army during 
the War of Independence, and surveyor-general of Pennsylvania 
from 1809 until his death. Horace Porter studied for a year 
(1854) at the Lawrence scientific school of Harvard University, 
and then entered the United States Military Academy, where 
he graduated in i860, third in his class. During the Civil War he 
was chief of ordnance at the capture of Fort Pulaski; then served 
in the Army of the Potomac until after Antietam; was transferred 
to the west, where he took part in the battles of Chickamauga 
(for gallantry in which he received a congressional medal of 
honour in June 1902) and Chattanooga; and in April 1864 
became aide-de-camp to General Grant, in which position he 
served until March 1869. He earned the brevet of captain at Fort 
Pulaski, that of major at the battle of the Wilderness, and that 
of lieutenant-colonel at New Market Heights, and in March 1865 
was breveted colonel and brigadier-general. From August 1867 
to January 1868, while General Grant was secretary of war ad 
interim, Porter was an assistant secretary, and from March 1869 to 
January 1873, when Grant was president, Porter was his executive 
secretary. He resigned from the army in December 1873, when 
he became vice-president of the Pullman Palace Car Company 
and held other business positions. From March 1897 to May 1905 
he was United States ambassador to France. At his personal 
expense' he conducted (1 890-1 905) a successful search for the 
body of John Paul Jones, 1 who had died in Paris in 1792. For 
this he received (May 9, 1906) a unanimous vote of thanks of 
both Houses of Congress, and the privileges of the floor for life. 
In 1907 he was a member of the American delegation to the 
Hague Peace Conference. General Porter became well-known 
as a public speaker, and delivered orations at the dedication of 
General Grant's tomb in New York, at the centennial of the 
founding of West Point, and at the re-interment of the body of 
John Paul Jones at Annapolis. His publications include West 
Point Life (1866) and Campaigning with Grant (1897)., 

PORTER, JANE (1776-1850), British novelist, daughter of 
an army surgeon, was born at Durham in 1776. Her life and 
reputation are closely linked with those of her sister, Anna Maria 
Porter (1780-1832), novelist, and her brother, Sir Robert Ker 
Porter (1775-1842), painter and traveller. After their father's 
death, in 1779, the mother removed from Durham, their birth- 
place, to Edinburgh, where the children's love of romance was 
stimulated by their association with Flora Macdonald and the 
young Walter Scott. . Mrs Porter moved to London, so that her 
son might study art, and the sisters subsequently resided at 
Thames Ditton and at Esher with their mother until her death 
in 1831. Anna Maria Porter published Artless Tales in 1793- 
1795, the first of along series of works of which the more note- 
worthy are Walsh Colville (1797), Octavia (1798), The Lake of 
Killarney ( 1 804) , A Sailor's Friendship and a Soldier's Love ( 1 805) , 
The Hungarian Brothers (1807), Don Sebastian (1809), Ballads, 
Romances and other Poems (1811), The Recluse of Norway (1814), 
The Knight of St John (1817), The Fast of St Magdalen (1818), 
The Village of Mariendorpt (1821), Roche Blanche (1822), Honor 
O'Hara (1826) and Barony (1830). Jane Porter — whose intel- 
lectual power, though slower in development and in expression, 
was greater than her sister's — had in the meantime gained imme- 
diate popularity by her first work, Thaddeus of Warsaw (1803), 

1 See Jones, John Paul, and an article by General Porter, " The 
Recovery of the Body of John Paul Jones," in the Century Magazine, 
(1905), lxx. 927 sqq. 



which was translated into several languages and procured her 
election as canoness of the Teutonic order of St Joachim. In 
1810, four years before the appearance of Waverley, she attempted 
national romance in her Scottish Chiefs. The story of Wallace 
had been a favourite one in her childhood, and she was probably 
well acquainted with the poem of Blind Harry (Henry the 
Minstrel). Although the book lacked historical accuracy, and 
the figure of Wallace is a sentimental conception of the least 
convincing kind, the picturesque power of narration displayed 
by Miss Porter has saved the story from the oblivion which has 
overtaken the works of most of Scott's predecessors in historical 
fiction. Her later works included The Pastor's Fireside (1815), 
Duke Christian of Liineburg (1824), Coming Out (1828) and The 
Field of Forty Footsteps (1828). In conjunction with her sister 
she published in 1826 the Tales round a Winter Hearth. She 
also wiote some plays, and frequent contributions to current 
periodical literature. Sir Edward Seaward's Diary (1831) was 
asserted by Miss Porter to be founded on documents placed in 
her hands by the author's family, but is generally regarded as 
pure fiction. The claim of her eldest brother, Dr William Ogilvie 
Porter, to its authorship rests on a memorial inscription in 
Bristol Cathedral, written by Jane. On the 21st of September 
1832 Anna Maria died, and for the next ten years Jane became 
" a wanderer " amongst her relations and friends. 

Robert Ker Porter had in his own way been scarcely less 
successful than his sisters. After two years of study at the 
Royal Academy he had gained reputation as a painter of altar- 
pieces and battle-scenes of imposing magnitude. He went to 
Russia as historical painter to the emperor in 1804, travelled 
in Finland and Sweden, where he received knighthood from 
Gustavus IV. in 1806, and accompanied Sir John Moore to 
Spain in 1808. In 181 1 he returned to Russia and married a 
Russian princess. He was knighted by the Prince Regent in 
1813. Ini8i7he travelled to Persia by way of St Petersburg 
and the Caucasus, returning through Bagdad and western 
Asia Minor. He examined the ruins of Persepolis, making many 
valuable drawings and copying cuneiform inscriptions. In 
1826 he became British consul in Venezuela. His services there 
were recognized by a knight commandership of the Order of 
Hanover. Accounts of his wanderings are to be found in his 
Travelling Sketches in Russia and Sweden (1808), Letters from 
Portugal and Spain (1809), Narrative of the late Campaign in 
Russia (1813), and Travels in Georgia, Persia, Armenia, Ancient 
Babylonia &c, during the years 1817-1820 (1821-1822). After 
leaving Venezuela (1841) he again visited St Petersburg, and died 
there suddenly on the 4th of May 1842. Jane Porter, who had 
joined him in Russia, then returned to England and took up 
her residence with her eldest brother at Bristol, where she died 
on the 24th of May 1850. 

PORTER, MARY (d. 1765), English actress, was brought to 
the attention of Betterton by Mrs Barry, who had seen her play 
the Fairy Queen at Bartholomew Fair. In his company she 
made her first appearance in 1699, in tragedy, in which she was 
at her best, although she also played a long list of comedy parts. 
When her friends, Mrs Barry, Mrs Bracegirdle and Mrs Oldfield, 
had retired from the stage, she was left its undisputed queen. 
She died on the 24th of February 1765. 

PORTER, NOAH (1811-1892), American educationalist and 
philosophical writer, was born in Farmington, Connecticut, on 
the 14th of December 1811. He graduated at Yale College, 
1 83 1, and laboured as a Congregational minister in Connecticut 
and Massachusetts, 1836-1846. He was elected professor of 
moral philosophy and metaphysics at Yale in 1846, and from 
1871 to 1886 he was president of the college. He edited several 
editions of Noah Webster's English dictionary, and wrote on 
education, &c. His best-known work is The Human Intellect, 
with an Introduction upon Psychology and the Human Soul (1868), 
comprehending a general history of philosophy, and following 
in part the " common-sense " philosophy of the Scottish school, 
while accepting the Kantian doctrine of intuition, and declaring 
the notion of design to be a priori. He died in New Haven on 
the 4th of March 1892.

PORTEUS, BE1LBY (1731-1808), bishop of London, was born 
at York and educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he 
became fellow in 1752. He was ordained in 1757, and in 1762 was 
appointed domestic chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury. 
In 1767 he became rector of Lambeth, and took his D.D. degree 
at Cambridge, preaching on that occasion a sermon which in- 
duced John Norris (1734-1777) to found the Norrisian professor- 
ship of divinity. About two years later he was appointed 
chaplain to the king and master of the hospital of St Cross, 
Winchester. In 1776 he became bishop of Chester, and in 
1787 he was translated to London. He was a supporter of the 
Church Missionary and the British and Foreign Bible societies, 
and laboured for the abolition of slavery. 

Of his published works the Review of the Life and Character of 
Archbishop Seeker (London, 1770), and the Summary of the principal 
Evidences for the Truth and Divine Origin of the Christian Revelation 
(London, 1800), have passed through numerous editions. 

PORTFOLIO (shortened form of porto folio, adapted from the 
Ital. portafogliy portare, to carry, and fogli, sheets or leaves of 
paper, Lat. folimn, leaf), a case for keeping papers, documents, 
prints, maps, &c, usually a leather book-cover with a flexible 
back. As the official documents of a state department are in 
the hands of the minister of that department, the word " port- 
folio " is frequently used figuratively of the office itself, par- 
ticularly on the continent of Europe, where the " portfolio " is 
the symbol of office, as, in English usage, the " seals " are for the 
secretaryships of state. The phrase " minister without port- 
folio " is applied to a member of a ministry to whom no special 
department is assigned. 

PORT GLASGOW, a municipal and police burgh and seaport 
of Renfrewshire, Scotland, on the southern shore of the Firth of 
Clyde, 20J m. W.N.W. of Glasgow by the Caledonian railway. 
Pop. (1001), 16,857. The ground behind the town rises to a 
height of 700 ft. and is partly occupied by villas. Amongst the 
principal buildings are the town house (1815), with a tower and 
spire; the town hall (1873); the tibrary (1887) founded by James 
Moffat, a merchant of the burgh, and the Carnegie Park Orphan- 
age, also provided from the same bequest. Birkmyre Park was 
opened in r8o4. The industries include shipbuilding and allied 
trades, engineering works, and iron and brass foundries. The 
area of the port (which has wet and graving docks) amounts to 
16 acres, and there are 2000 yds. of quayage. The harbours 
are accessible at all stages of the tide. The district originally 
formed part of the parish of Kilmalcolm, the nucleus of the town 
being the village of Newark attached to the barony of that name. 
In 1668 -it was purchased from Sir Patrick Maxwell of Newark 
by the Glasgow magistrates, who here constructed a harbour. 
In 1695 it was erected into a separate parish under the name of 
New Port Glasgow. In 17 10 it became the chief custom-house 
port for the Clyde, until superseded by Greenock. The graving 
dock made in 1762 was the first dock of the kind in Scotland. 
In 1775 Port Glasgow was created a burgh of barony and since 
1832 has formed one of the Kilmarnock parliamentary burghs 
(with Kilmarnock, Dumbarton, Renfrew and Rutherglen). It 
is governed by a council with provost and bailies. Adjoining 
the town on the east are the picturesque ruins of Newark Castle, 
a quadrangular building dating from the end of the 16th century. 
Formerly the property of the Dennistouns, it now belongs *o 
the Shaw-Stewarts. 

PORTHCAWL, a seaport and urban district in tht mid- 
parliamentary division of Glamorganshire, South Wales 30 m. 
by rail W. of Cardiff and 22 m. S.E. of Swansea. Pop (1901) 
1872. The urban district (formed in 1893) is conterminous 
with the civil parish of Newton Nottage, which, ir addition to 
Porthcawl proper, built on the sea-front, comprise* the ancient 
village of Nottage, 1 m. N., and the more modern v'llage of New- 
ton, 1 m. N.E. of Porthcawl. The natural harbour of Newton 
(as it used to be called) was improved by a breaV water, and was 
connected by a tramway with Maesteg, whence coal and iron 
were brought for shipment. The tramway whs converted into 
a railway, and in 1865 opened for passenger traffic. In 1866 a 
dock (7J acres) and tidal basin (2J acres* were constructed, but 



since about 1002 they have fallen into disuse and the coal is' 
diverged to other ports, chiefly Port Talbot. Porthcawl, however, 
has grown in popularity as a watering-place. Situated on a 
slightly elevated headland facing Swansea Bay and the Bristol 
Channel, it has fine sands, rocks and breezy commons, on one of 
which, near golf links resorted to from all parts of Glamorgan, is' 
" The Rest," a convalescent home for the working classes, 
completed in 1891, with accommodation for eighty persons. 
The climate of Porthcawl is bracing, and the rainfall (averaging 
25 in.) is about the lowest on the South Wales coast. The district 
is described by R. D. Blackmore in his tale The Maid of Sker 
(1872), based on a legend associated - with Sker House, a 
fine Elizabethan building in the adjoining parish of Sker, which 
was formerly extra-parochial. The parish church (dedicated to 
St John the Baptist) has a pre-Reformation stone altar and an 
ancient carved stone pulpit, said to be the only relic of an earlier 
church now covered by the sea. 

PORT HOPE, a town and port of entry of Durham county, 
Ontario, Canada, on the north shore of Lake Ontario, 6$ m. N.E. 
of Toronto by the Grand Trunk railway, and connected with 
Charlotte, the port for Rochester, New York, by a daily steamboat 
service. The population, 5585 in 1881, shrunk in 1901 to 4188, 
but is increasing owing to the popularity of the town as a summer 
resort. It is picturesquely situated on the side and at the foot 
of hills overlooking the lake; and Smith's Creek, by which it is 
traversed, supplies abundant water-power. Trade is carried on 
in lumber, grain and flour. Trinity College School, a residential 
school under Anglican control, has a long and creditable history. 

PORT HUDSON, a village in East Baton Rouge Parish, 
Louisiana, U.S.A., on the left bank of the Mississippi, about 
135 m. above New Orleans. At the sharp turn of the Missis- 
sippi here the Confederates in 1862 built on the commanding 
bluffs powerful batteries covering a stretch of about 3 m., their 
strongest fortifications along the Mississippi between New Orleans 
and Vicksburg. On the night of the 14th of March 1863 Admiral 
Farragut, with seven vessels, attempted to run past the batteries, 
commanded by Brigadier-General William M. Gardner, but four 
of his vessels were disabled and forced to turn back, one, the 
" Mississippi " was destroyed, and only two, the " Hartford " and 
the " Albatross " got past. General N. P. Banks's land attack, 
on the 27 th of May, was unsuccessful, the Union loss, nearly 
2000, being six times that of the Confederates. A second attack 
on the 14th of June, entailed a further Union loss of about 
1800 men. But on the 9th of July, two days after the news 
of the surrender of Vicksburg, after a siege of 45 days, General 
Gardner surrendered the position to General Banks with about 
6400 men, 50 guns, 5000 small arms and ammunition, and two 
river steamers. The Union losses during the siege were probably 
more than 4000; the Confederate losses about 800. The capture 
of Vicksburg and Port Hudson secured to the Union the 
control of the Mississippi. 

PORT HURON, a city and the county-seat of Saint Clair 
county, Michigan, U.S.A., at the. confluence of the Saint Clair 
and Black rivers, and at the lower end of Lake Huron, about 
60 m. N.N.E. of Detroit- Pop. (1900), 19,158 of whom 7142 were 
foreign-born; (1910 U.S. census) 18,863. It is served by the Grand 
Trunk and other railways, and by steamboat lines to Chicago 
and other ports. A railway tunnel, 6025 ft. long, under the, Saint 
Clair, connects the city with Sarnia, Canada. The tunnel, which 
has an inside diameter of 20 ft., was constructed by the Grand 
Trunk railway in 1 880-1 891 at a cost of about $2,700,000, and 
was designed by Joseph Hobson (b. 1834). Port Huron is laid 
out with wide streets, on both sides of the Black river and along 
the shore of Lake Huron; it has attractive parks and mineral 
water springs, and is a summer resort. Among its buildings are 
the court house, the city hall, and a Modern Maccabee Temple 1 — 
Port Huron being the headquarters of the Knights of the Modern 
Maccabees (1881), a fraternal society which, in 1910, had a mem- 
bership of 107,737. Until 1908 Port Huron was the headquarters 
of the Knights of the Maccabees of the World (founded in 1883; 
283,998 members in 1910). Port Huron has large shipping 
interests, and since 1866 has been the port of entry of the Huron

customs district. In 1908 its exports were valued at $16,958,080 
and its imports at $4,859,120. The city has shipyards, dry 
docks, large shops of the Grand Trunk railway, publishing 
houses, and manufactories of agricultural implements, steel ships, 
automobiles, foundry products, paper and pulp, and toys. In 
1904 the city's factory products were valued at $4,789,589. 

In 1686 the French established Fort St Joseph, a fortified trading 
post, which came into the possession of the British in 1761 and was 
occupied by American troops in 1814. The fort was renamed 
Fort Gratiot in honour of General Charles Gratiot (1788-1855), who 
was chief -engineer in General W. H. Harrison's army in 1 813-1814, 
and was chief-engineer of the U.S. Army in ] 828-1838. The settlement 
which grew up round the fort, and was organized as a village in 1840, 
was also known as Fort Gratiot, and was annexed to Port Huron 
in 1893. The fort was abandoned during 1837-1848, during 1852- 
1866, and, permanently, in 1879. The earliest permanent settlement, 
in what later became Port Huron, was made in 1790 by several French 
families. This settlement, distinct from that at the fort, was first 
called La Riviere De Lude, and, after 1828, Desmond. It was platted 
in 1835, incorporated as a village in 1840 (under its present name), 
and chartered as a city in 1857. 

PORTICI, a town of Campania, Italy, in the province of Naples, 
5 m. S.E. of Naples by rail, on the snores of the bay, and at the 
foot of Vesuvius. Pop. (1901), 14,239. The palace, erected in 
1738, is traversed by the high road. It once contained the 
antiquities from Herculaneum, now removed to Naples, and since 
1882 it has been a government school of agriculture. There is a 
small harbour. Just beyond Portici, on the south east, is Resina 
(pop, in 1 901, 20,182), on the site of the ancient Herculaneum, 
with several fine modern villas. The inhabitants are engaged 
in fishing, silk-growing and silk-weaving. The town was com- 
pletely destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in 1631. 

PORTICO (Ital. for "porch," Lat. porticus), a term in 
architecture for the covered entrance porch to a building, which 
is carried by columns, and either constitutes the whole front of 
the building, as in the Greek and Roman temples, or forms an 
important feature, as the portico of the Pantheon at Rome 
attached to the rotunda, A circular projecting portico, such 
as those to the north and south transepts of St Paul's Cathedral, 
and that which forms the west entrance of St Mary le Strand, is 
known as cyclostyle. The term porticus is used to distinguish 
the entrance portico in an amphiprostylar or peripteral temple 
from that behind which is called the posticum. 

PORTIERE, a hanging placed over a door, as its French name 
implies, or over the doorless entrance to a room. From the 
East, where doors are still rare, it came to Europe at a remote 
date — it is known to have been in use in the West in the 14th 
century, and was probably introduced much earlier. Like so 
many other domestic plenishings, it reached England by way of 
France, where it appears to have been originally called rideaa 
de porte. It is still extensively used either as an ornament or as 
a means of mitigating draughts. It is usually of some heavy 
material, such as velvet, brocade, or plush, and is often fixed 
upon a brass arm, moving in a socket with the opening and closing 
of the door. . 

PORT JACKSON, or Sydney Harbour, a harbour of New 
South Wales, Australia. It is one of the safest and most 
beautiful harbours in the world; its area, including all its bays, 
is about 15 sq. m., with a shore line of 165 m.; it has deep water 
in every part, and is landlocked and secure in all weathers. 
The entrance, between two rocky promontories known as North 
and South Heads, is 2\ m. wide between the outer heads, and 
narrows down to 1 m. 256 yds. The port is flanked on both 
sides by promontories, so that, in addition to a broad and deep 
central channel, there is a series of sheltered bays with good 
anchorage. Sydney lies on the southern shore about 4 m. from 
the Heads. Port Jackson is the chief naval dep6t of Australasia, 
the headquarters of the admiral's station, and is strongly fortified. 
The harbour has a number of islands, most of which are used for 
naval or government purposes — Shark Island is the quarantine 
station, Garden Island has naval foundries, hospital and stores, 
Goat Island is occupied by a powder magazine, Spectacle Island 
is used to store explosives, and on Cockatoo Island are important 
government docks. Port Jackson was discovered by Captain 



Phillip in 1788, though in 1770 Captain Cook, when coasting 
north, noticed what looked like an inlet, and named it after Sir 
George Jackson, one of the secretaries to the Admiralty. Captain 
Cook passed the harbour without recognizing its capacity; but 
the cliffs which guard the entrance are 300 ft. high, and no view 
of the basin can be seen from the masthead. Middle Head, 
which is opposite the entrance, closes it in, and it is necessary 
to enter, turn to the south, and then to the west before the best 
part of the harbour discloses itself. 

PORT JERVIS, a city of Orange county, New York, U.S.A., 
on the Delaware river, at its junction with the Neversink, SS m. 
N.W. of New York city by rail, and at the intersection of the 
boundary lines of the states of New York, New Jersey and Penn- 
sylvania. Pop. (1900), 9385, of whom 895 were" foreign-born; 
(1910 census), 9564. It is served by the Erie and the New 
York, Ontario & Western railways. The beauty of the scenery 
in its vicinity has made the city a summer resort. At Port 
Jervis are situated the extensive shops of the Erie railway. 
Among the manufactures are wearing apparel, silk, glass, and 
silver ware. The value of the factory products increased from 
$1,009,081 in 1900 to $1,635,215 in 1905, or 62%. Pori 
Jervis was laid out in 1826, soon after work began on the Dela 
ware & Hudson Canal; it owes its origin to that waterway (nov 
abandoned), and was named in honour of John Bloomfieldjervii 
( 1 795-1885), the engineer who constructed the canal, who, 11 
1836, was in charge of the construction of the Croton Aqueduct, 
and wrote Railway Property (1859) and The Construction and 
Management of Railways (1861). Port Jervis was incorporated 
as a village in 1853, and was chartered as a city in 1907. 

PORTLAND, EARL OF, an English title held by the family 
of Weston from 1633 to 1688, and by the family of Bentinck 
from 1689 to 17 16, when it was merged in that of duke of Port- 
land. Sir Richard Weston (1 577-1635), according to Clarendon 
" a gentleman of very ancient extraction by father and mother," 
was the son and heir of Sir Jerome Weston (c. 1 550-1603) of 
Skreens, in Roxwell, Essex, his grandfather being Richard 
Weston (d. 1572) justice of the common pleas. A member of 
parliament during the reigns of James I. and Charles I., Sir 
Richard was sent abroad by James on two occasions to negotiate 
on behalf of the elector palatine Frederick V.; after the murder 
of the duke of Buckingham, he became the principal counsellor 
of Charles I. In 1628 he was created Baron Weston of Neyland 
and in 1633 earl of Portland. Having in 1625 and 1626 had 
experience in the difficult task of t obtaining money for the royal 
needs from the House of Commons, Weston was made lord high 
treasurer in 1628. His own inclinations and the obstacles in 
the way of raising money made him an advocate of a policy of 
peace and neutrality. His conduct was frequently attacked in 
parliament, but he retained both his office and the confidence 
of the king until his death on the 13th of March 1635. His son 
Jerome, the 2nd earl (1605-1663), was imprisoned for plotting 
in the interests of Charles I. in 1643, and was nominally president 
"of Munster from 1644 to 1660. He sat in the convention 
parliament of 1660. He was succeeded by his son Charles 
(1 630-1665), who was killed in a sea-fight with the Dutch off the 
Texel, and then by his brother Thomas (1600-1688), who died 
in poverty at Louvain, when the title became extinct. In 1689 
it was revived by William III., who bestowed it upon his favourite 
William Bentinck (see below.) 

Sir Richard Weston must be distinguished from a contemporary 
and namesake, Sir Richard Weston (c. 1 570-1652), baron of 
the exchequer. Another Sir Richard Weston (c. 1466-1542) 
was a courtier and a diplomatist under Henry VIII.; his son was 
Sir Francis Weston (c. 1511-1536), who was beheaded for his 
alleged adultery with Anne Boleyn. This Sir Richard had a 
brother, Sir William Weston (d. 1540), who distinguished himself 
at the defence of Rhodes in 1522, and was afterwards prior of the 
Knights of St John in England. A third Sir Richard Weston 
(1591-1652), was mainly reponsible for introducing locks on the 
Wey and thus making this river navigable. 

Another family of Weston produced Robert Weston (c. 151 5- 
1573), lord chancellor of Ireland from 1566 until his death on the

20th of May 1573. Other famous Westons were Stephen Weston 
(1665-1742) bishop of Exeter from 1724 until his death, and his 
son Edward Weston (1703-177°) the writer. 

Much of the carl of Portland's correspondence is in the Public 
Record Office, London. For his political career sec S. R. Gardiner, 
History of England (1883-1884), and L. von Ranke, Engltsche 
Geschichte (Eng. trans., Oxford, 1875). 

PORTLAND, WILLIAM BENTINCK, Earl OF (c. 1645-1709), 
English statesman, was born, according to the Dutch historian, 
Groen van Prinstercr, in 1645, although most of the other 
authorities give the date as 1649. The son of Henry Bcntinck 
of Diepenheim, he was descended from an ancient and noble 
family of Geldcrland. He became page of honour and then 
gentleman of the bedchamber to William, prince of Orange. 
When, in 1675, the prince was attacked by small-pox, Bentinck 
nursed him assiduously, and this devotion secured for him the 
special and enduring friendship of William; henceforward, by 
his prudence and ability, he fully justified the confidence placed 
in him. In 1677 he was sent to England to solicit for the prince 
of Orange, the hand of Mary, daughter of James duke of York, 
afterwards James IL, and he was again in England in 1683 and 
in 1685. When, in 1688, William was preparing for his invasion 
Bentinck went to some of the German princes to secure their t 
support, or at least their neutrality, and he was also a medium 
of communication between his master and his English friends. 
He superintended the arrangements for the expedition and sailed 
to England with the prince. 

The revolution accomplished, Bentinck was made groom of the 
stole, first gentleman of the bedchamber, and a privy councillor; 
and in April 1689 he was created Baron Cirencester, Viscount 
Woodstock and earl of Portland. He commanded some cavalry 
at the battle of the Boyne in 1690, and was present at the battle 
of Landen, where he was wounded, and at the siege of Namur. 
But his main work was of a diplomatic nature. Having thwarted 
the plot to murder the king in 1696, he helped to arrange the 
peace of Ryswick in 1697; in 1698 he was ambassador to Paris, 
where he opened negotiations with Louis XIV. for a partition of 
the Spanish monarchy, and as William's representative, he signed 
the two partition treaties. Portland had, however, become very 
jealous of the. rising influence of Arnold van Keppel, earl of 
Albemarle, and, in 1699, he resigned all his offices in the royal 
household. But he did not forfeit the esteem of the king, who 
continued to trust and employ him. Portland had been loaded 
with gifts, and this, together with the jealousy felt for him as a 
foreigner, made him very unpopular in England. He received 
135,000 acres of land in Ireland, and only the strong opposition 
of a united House of Commons prevented him obtaining a large 
gift of crown lands in North Wales. For his share in drawing 
up the partition treaties he was impeached in 1701, but the case 
against him was not proceeded with. He was occasionally 
employed on public business under Anne until his death at his 
residence, Bulstrode in Buckinghamshire, on the 23rd of Novem- 
ber 1709. Portland's eldest son Henry (1680-1724) succeeded 
as 2nd earl. He was created marquess of Titchfield and duke of 
Portland in 17 16.

PORTLAND, WILLIAM HENRY CAVENDISH BENTINCK, 
3rd Duke of (i 738-1 809), prime minister of England, son of 
William, 2nd duke (1709-1762), and grandson of the 1st duke. 
His mother, Margaret, granddaughter and heiress of John 
Holies, duke of Newcastle, brought to her husband Welbcck 
Abbey and other estates in Nottinghamshire. He was born on 
the 14th of April 1738, and was educated at Oxford, where he 
graduated M.A. in 1757. In 1761, as marquess of Titchfield, he 
became M.P. for the borough of Weobly (Hereford), but in May 
1762 he was called to the upper house on the death of his 
father. Under the marquess of Rockingham he was, from July 
1765 to December 1766, lord chamberlain, and on the return of 
Rockingham to power in April 1782 he was made lord-lieutenant 



of Ireland. After the short ministry of Shelburne, succeeding 
the death of Rockingham, the duke of Portland was selected by 
Fox and North as a " convenient cipher " to become the head of 
the coalition ministry, to the formation of which the king was 
with great reluctance compelled to give his assent. The duke 
held the premiership from the 5th of April 1783 until the defeat of 
the bill for " the just and efficient government of British India " 
caused his dismissal from office on the 17th of December following. 
Under Pitt he was, from 1794 to 1801, secretary of state for the 
home department, after which he was, from 1801 to 1805, 
president of the council. In 1807 he was appointed a second 
time prime minister and first lord of the treasury. Ill health 
caused him to resign in October 1809, and he died on the 30th of 
that month. He owed his political influence chiefly to his rank, 
his mild disposition, and his personal integrity, for his talents 
were in no sense brilliant, and he was deficient in practical energy 
as well as in intellectual grasp. 

He married in 1766 Lady Dorothy Cavendish (i75°-i794)» 
daughter of the 4th duke of Devonshire, and was succeeded as 
4th duke by his son William Henry (1768-1854), who married 
a daughter of the famous gambler, General John Scott, and was 
brother-in-law to Canning. His son, the 5th duke, William 
John Cavendish Bentinck-Scott (1 800-1 879) died unmarried. 
He is notable for having constructed the underground halls at 
Welbeck Abbey, and for his retiring habits of life, which gave 
occasion for some singular stories. 1 He was succeeded by his 
cousin William John Arthur Charles James Cavendish- 
Bentinck (b. 1857) as 6th duke. 

PORTLAND, a seaport of Normanby county, Victoria, 
Australia, 250 m. by rail S.W. of Melbourne. Pop. (1901), 
2185. It stands on the western shore of a magnificent bay, 
24 m. long and 12 m. broad, and is the outlet for a rich agri- 
cultural and pastoral tract. 

PORTLAND, the largest city of Maine, U.S.A., the county- 
seat of Cumberland county, and a port of entry, on Casco Bay, 
about 115 m - by rail N.N.E. of Boston. Pop. (1890), 36,425; 
(1900), 50,145, of whom 34,918 were born in Maine, 3125 in 
the other New England states, 4476 in Canada, and 3273 in 
Ireland, and 291 were negroes; (19 10 census) 58,571. Port- 
land is served by the Maine Central, the Boston & Maine, 
and the Grand Trunk railways; by steamboat lines to New 
York, Boston, Bar Harbor, Saint John, N.B., and other coast 
ports, and, during the winter season, by the Allan and Dominion 
transatlantic lines. It is connected by ferry with South 
Portland. 

1 Public interest centred for some years round the allegation that 
he lived a double life and was identical with Mr T. C. Druce, an 
upholsterer of Baker Street, London, who, in 1851, married Annie 
May. The " Druce case/' involving a claim to the title and estates, 
by Mrs Druce (widow of W. T. Druce, son of T. C. Druce by Annie 
May) on behalf of her son, aroused much attention from 1897 to 1908. 
The duke of Portland was undoubtedly buried in Kensal Green 
cemetery in 1879. " Druce," on the other hand, was supposed to 
have died in 1864 and been interred in Highgate cemetery, his will 
bequeathing over £70,000 in personal estate. Mrs Druce's claims 
had two aspects, both as involving the revocation of probate of 
T. C. Druce 's will, and also as identifying Druce with the duke of 
Portland. But her application to have the grave in Highgate opened 
(with the object of showing that the coffin there was empty), though 
granted by Dr Tristram, chancellor of the diocese of London, was 
thwarted by a caveat being entered on the part of the executor of 
T. C. Druce's will; and the case became tne subject of constant 
proceedings in the law-courts without result. Meanwhile it was 
discovered that children of T. C. Druce bv a former wife were living 
in Australia, and Mrs Druce's claims fell into the background, the 
case being taken up independently by Mr G. H. Druce as the repre- 
sentative of this family, from 1903 onwards. A company to finance 
his case was formed in 1905, and in the autumn of 1907 he instituted 
a charge of perjury against Mr Herbert Druce, T. C. Druce's younger 
son and executor, for having sworn that he had seen his father die 
in 1864. Sensational evidence of a mock burial was given by an 
American witness named Caldwell, and others; but eventually it 
was agreed that the grave at Highgate should be opened. This was 
done on December the 30th, and the body of Mr T. C. Druce was 
then found in the coffin. The charge of perjuryat once collapsed 
and was withdrawn on January 6th, the opening of the grave 
definitely putting an end to the story of an identity between the 
two men.

PORTLAND 



I 



The hilly peninsula, to which Portland was confined until 
the annexation of the town of Deering in 1899, is nearly 3 m. in 
length by about Jm. in average width; at its east end is Munjoy 
Hill, 160 ft. above the sea, and its west end Bramhall Hill, 15 ft. 
higher. Portland's total land area is about 2i£ sq. m. The 
scenery in and about the city is noted for its picturesqueness, 
and this, with its delightful summer climate and historic interest, 
attracts a large number of visitors during the summer season. 
Munjoy Hill commands a fine view of Casco Bay, which is over- 
looked by other wooded heights. There is excellent yachting 
in the bay, which contains many beautiful islands, such as 
Peaks and Cushing's islands. Bramhall Hill commands an 
extensive view west and north-west of the bay, the mainland, 
and the White Mountains some 80 m. distant. 

The city's park system includes the Western Promenade, on 
Bramhall Hill; the Eastern Promenade, on Munjoy Hill; Fort Allen 
Park, at the south extremity of the latter promenade ; Foit Sumner, 
another small park farther west, on the same hill; Lincoln Park, 
containing 2$ acres of beautiful grounds near the centre of the city; 
Deering's Oaks (made famous by Longfellow), the principal park 
(50 acres) on the peninsula, with many fine old trees, pleasant drives, 
and an artificial pond used for boating; and Monument Square 
and Boothby Square. There are many pleasant drives along the 
shore of the bay or the banks of rivers, and some of these lead to 
popular resorts, such as Riverton Park, on the Presumpscot ; Cape 
Cottage Park, at the mouth of the harbour; and Falmouth Foreside, 
boidering the inner bay. 

The streets of Portland are generally well paved, are unusually 
clean, and, in the residence districts, where the fire of 1866 did not 
extend, they are profusely shaded by elms and other large trees — 
Portland has been called the " Forest City.'\ Congress Street, the 
principal thoroughfare, extends along the middle of the peninsula 
north-east and south-west and from one end of t it to the other, passing 
in the middle of its course through the shopping district. 

In Portland's architecture, both public and private, there ismuch 
that is excellent; and there are a number of buildings of historic 
interest. The Post Office, at the corner of Exchange and Middle 
streets, is of white Vermont marble and has a Corinthian portico. 
The granite Customs House, extending from Fore Street to Commer- 
cial Street, is large and massive. The Public Library building 
is Romanesque and elaborately ornamented ; _ the building was 

C resented to the city by James P. Baxter ; in the library is the statue, 
y Benjamin Paul Akers (1825-1861), of the dead pearl-diver, well 
known from Hawthorne's description in The Marble Faun* The 
Cumberland County Court House, of white Maine granite, occupies 
the block bounded by Federal, Pearl, Church and Newbury streets ; 
immediately opposite (to the south-west) is the Federal Court build- 
ing, also of Maine granite. The Portland Observatory, on Munjoy 
Hill, erected in 1807 to detect approaching vessels, rises 222 ft. above 
tide-water. In Monument Square, the site of a battery in 1775 
is a soldiers* and sailors' monument (1889), a tall granite pedestal 
surmounted by a bronze female figure, by Franklin Simmons; 
at the corner of State Street is a statue of Henry W. Longfellow by 
the same sculptor; and where Congress Street crosses the Eastern 
Promenade, a monument to the first settlers, George Cleeve and 
Richard Tucker. On the Western Promenade there is a monument 
to Thomas Brackett Reed, who was a native and a resident of Port- 
land. On Congress Street, below the Observatory, is the Eastern 
Cemetery, the oldest burying ground of the city ; in it are the graves 
of Commodore Edward Preble, and of Captain Samuel Blythe 
(178A-1813) and Captain William Burroughs (1785-18 13), who were 
killed in the engagement between the British brig " Boxer " and the 
American brig " Enterprise," their respective ships, off this coast 
on the 5th of September 1813. The cemetery also contains monu- 
ments to Alonzo P. Stinson, the first soldier from Portland killed 
in the Civil War, to the Portland soldiers in the War of Independence, 
and to Rear- Admiral James Alden (18 10-1877), of the U.S. Navy, a 
native of Portland. Among the churches are the Cathedral of the 
Immaculate Conception (Roman Catholic), with a spire 236 ft. high, 
and St Luke's (Protestant Episcopal) Cathedral. In the Williston 
Church (Congregational), in Thomas Street, the Young People's 
Society of Christian Endeavor was founded in 1881 by the Rev. 
Francis E. Clark, then pastor of the church. The finest residence 
district is on Bramhall Hill. Many houses, especially in State, 
Dan forth and Congress streets, are simple in style and old-fashioned 
in architecture. Of special interest to visitors is the Wadsworth- 
Longfellow House — the early home of Henry W. Longfellow — 
which was built in 1785-1786 by General Peleg Wadsworth (1748- 
1829), a soldier of the War of Independence, a representative in 
Congress from 1793 to 1807, and the grandfather of the poet; was 
given by Longfellow's sister, Mrs Anne Longfellow Pierce (1810-1901) 
to the Maine Historical Society; and contains interesting relics of 
the Wadsworth and Longfellow families, and especially of the poet 
himself. Behind the ' r Home " is the Library of the Maine 
Historical Society. The birthplace of Longfellow is now a tenement 



house at the corner of Fore and Hancock streets, near the Grariti 
Trunk railway station. 

In Portland, as in Bangor, the Maine Music Festival (begun in 
1897) is held every year in October, three concerts being given by a 
chorus composed of local choruses trained in different cities of the 
state for the festival. 

Among the institutions are: The Medical School of Maine, the 
medical department of Bowdoin College — instruction being given 
here during the last two years of the course ; Westbrook Seminary 
(chartered in 1831, and empowered to grant degrees in 1863); the 
Public Library, containing (1910) 65,000 vols.; the Library of the 
Maine Historical Society (30,000 vols.); the Mechanics' Library, 
the Greenleaf Law Library, the Maine General Hospital, and the 
United States Marine Hospital. The Portland Society of Natural 
History, founded in 1843 and incorporated in 1850, has a building 
(1880) containing < a library and natural history collections. The 
city is supplied with good water from Lake Sebago, 17 m. distant. 

The harbour has an artificial breakwater and extensive modern 
fortifications (Fort Preble, on the Cape Shore; Fort Levett, on 
Cushing's Island; Fort Williams, at Portland Head; and Fort 
McKimey, on Great Diamond Island) among the best equipped in 
the United States. For a long period the city was noted for its 
commerce with the West Indies, which began to decline about 1876, 
but the coast trade and commerce with Great Britain are still con- 
siderable, especially in the winter, when Portland is the outlet of 
much of the trade from the Great Lakes that in the other seasons 
passes through Montreal. The principal exports are grain, live- 
stock and fruit. In 1908 the exports were valued at $11,353,339 
and the imports at $1,180,964. The Grand Trunk Railroad 
Company has here two of the largest grain warehouses on the Atlantic 
Coast. In 1905 Portland was the first manufacturing city of the 
state, with a factory product valued at $9,132,801 (as against 
$8,527,649 for Lewiston, which outranked Portland in 1900); here 
are foundries and machine-shops, planing-mills, car and railway 
repair shops, packing and^ canning establishments — probably the 
first Indian corn canned in the United States was canned near 
Portland in 1840 — potteries, and factories for making boots, shoes, 
clothing, matches, screens, sleighs f> carriages, cosmetics, &c. Ship- 
building and fishing are important industries. 

The first permanent settlement on the peninsula was 
established by George Cleeve and Richard Tucker at the foot 
of Munjoy Hill in 1633 immediately after they had been ejected 
from land which they had claimed at the mouth of the Spurwink. 
Soon the hill at the east end became the property of George 
Munjoy and that at the west end the property of George Bram- 
hall. The Indian name of the peninsula was Machegonne, and the 
new settlement was during the next few years known by various 
names, such as Casco, Casco Neck, Cleeve's Neck, and Munjoy's 
Neck. In 1658 Massachusetts extended its jurisdiction over this 
part of Maine. The peninsula, with considerable neighbouring 
territory and Cape Elizabeth, was organized as a town in 1 718 and 
was named Falmouth. The town suffered so severely from the 
Indians in 1676 that it was deserted until 1678. It was attacked 
in 1689, and in 1690 it was utterly destroyed by the French and 
Indians, and remained desolate until after the Treaty of Utrecht 
in 1713. When the port of Boston was closed by Great Britain 
in 1774 the bell of the old First Parish Church (Unitarian) of 
Portland (built 1740; the present building dates from 1825) 
was muffled and rung from morning till night, and in other ways 
the town showed its sympathy for the patriot cause. As a 
punishment, on the 1 8th of October 1 7 7 5, the town was bombarded 
and burned by a British fleet. The peninsula portion of 
Falmouth was incorporated as a distinct town in 1786 and was 
named Portland. Portland was the capital of the state from 
1820 to 1832 and in the latter year was chartered as a city. 
In 1886 a large central portion of the city, about 200 acres, 
was destroyed by a fire resulting from a Fourth of July 
celebration. Portland was the birthplace of Henry Wadsworth 
Longfellow, Thomas Brackett Reed, Edward Preble and his 
nephew George Henry Preble, Mrs Parton (" Fanny Fern "),

PORTLAND, a city, port of entry and the county-seat of 
Multnomah county, Oregon, U.S.A., on the Willamette river, 
near its confluence with the Columbia, about 120 m. by water 
from the Pacific, 186 m. by rail S.S.W. of Seattle and about

772 m. N. of San Francisco. Pop. (1890), 46,385; (1900), 
00,426, of whom 25,876 were foreign-born (6943 Chinese); 
(19 10 census) 207,214. Portland is served by the Northern 
Pacific, the Southern Pacific, the Canadian Pacific, the Great 
Northern and other railways, by transpacific vessels to Hong- 
Kong and Yokohama, by coast-wise vessels to San Francisco, to 
ports on Puget Sound, in British Columbia, and in Alaska, and 
by river boats sailing 100 m. farther up the Willamette and up 
the Columbia and the Clearwater to Lewiston, Idaho. The city 
is built on both sides of the river (which is crossed by five bridges), 
and covers about 44 sq. m. On the western side the ground 
rises gradually for a distance of J to i£ m., and then rises abruptly 
500-1000 ft. to " Portland Heights " and " Council Crest," 
beyond the much-broken surface of which rises the Coast range; 
on the eastern side a slightly rolling surface extends to the foot- 
hills of the Cascade Mountains. From " Portland Heights " there 
are fine views of the Columbia and Willamette valleys, and, par- 
ticularly, of the snow-clad summits of Mt Hood, Mt Jefferson, Mt 
St Helen's, Mt Adams and Mt Rainier (or Tacoma). In the 
residence districts (King's Hill, Nob Hill, Portland Heights, 
Willamette Heights, Hawthorne Avenue, &c.) are pleasantly 
shaded streets, and grounds decorated with shrubs, especially 
roses, which sometimes bloom as late as January — an 
annual " Rose Festival " is held here in June. The city has 
205 acres in parks and numerous beautiful drives. It has a fine 
climate, the mean temperature during the winter months from 
1874 to 1903 was 41 F.; the mean summer temperature for the 
same period 65 F. For the year ending the 31st of May 1900 
the death-rate was reported to be only 9 per 1000, and in 1907 
to be only 8*28 per 1000. The city's water is brought through 
a pipe 30 m. in length from Bull Run river, which is fed by 
Bull Run Lake at an elevation of more than 3000 ft. in the 
Cascade Mountains. 

Among the prominent buildings are the Court House; the City 
Hall, containing the rooms of the Oregon Historical Society; the 
Customs House; the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral; the Public 
Library (with 75,000 volumes in 1908); several tall office buildings 
with frames of steel; and the Art Museum (1905). There are large 
£rain elevators and miles of wharfs and docks. Among educational 
institutions are the law and medical departments of the University 
of Oregon T Hill Military Academy (1901) and Columbia University 
(Roman Catholic, 1901). The Oregonian, which was established 
here in 1850, is one of the most influential newspapers on the Pacific 
Slope. 

The harbour is accessible for vessels of 26 ft. draught and the city's 
leading industry is the shipment by water and by rail of fish 
(especially salmon) and of the products (largely lumber, wheat and 
fruits) of the rich Willamette and Columbia valleys. It is also an 
important jobbing centre. The value of the exports in 1908 
amounted to $16,652,850 and the value of the imports to $2,937,513 ; 
the foreign trade is chiefly with Great Britain and its possessions, 
and with the Orient, where wheat and flour are exchanged for raw 
silk, tea and manila and other fibres. Portland is the principal 
manufacturing city of the state. The total value of its factory pro- 
duct in 1905 was $28,651,321. The principal manufactures were 
lumber and timber products ($3,577,465) and flour and grist mill pro- 
ducts ($2,712,735); other important manufactures were packed 
meat, plamng-mill products, foundry and machine-shop products, 
railway cars (repaired), cordage and twine, and canned and preserved 
fish (salmon), oysters and fruits and vegetables. 

Portland, named after Portland, Maine, was founded in 
1845 by two real-estate men from New England, and was char- 
tered as a city in 1851. Its early growth was promoted by the 
demand for provisions from California soon after the discovery 
of gold there, and although a considerable portion was swept 
by fire in 1873 the city had a population of nearly 20,000 before 
railway communication with the East was established by the 
Northern Pacific in 1883. East Portland and Albina were 
annexed to the city in July 1801. The Lewis and Clark Cen- 
tennial and American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair was 
held in Portland in 1905 in commemoration of the expedition 
of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to this region in 1805. 
The forestry building, 205 ft. long by 108 ft. wide and built of 
logs of Oregon fir 6 ft. or more in diameter and 54 ft. long, and 
a building devoted entirely to the subject of irrigation, were of 
unusual interest. The forestry building is now maintained as 
a museum chiefly for timber and timber products. 



PORTLAND, ISLE OF, properly a peninsula of the coast 
of Dorsetshire, England, as a prolongation of a narrow ridge 
of shingle, Chcsil Bank (q.v.), connects it with the mainland. 
Pop. (1901), 15,262. It is 4 m. long and nearly ij in extreme 
breadth, with an area of about 4§ sq. m. The shores are wild 
and precipitous, and Portland is inaccessible from the sea except 
towards the south. The highest point, close upon 500 ft., 
is the Verne hill in the north. Wave action is seen in the 
numerous caverns, and south-east of Portland Bill, the southern 
extremity of the isle, is a bank called the Shambles, ^between 
which and the land there flows a dangerous current called the 
Race of Portland. A raised beach is seen at Portland Bill. 
The substratum of the island is Kimeridge Clay, above which 
rests beds of sand and strata of Oolitic limestone, widely famed as 
a building stone. Extensive quarries, which are Crown property, 
have supplied the materials for St Paul's Cathedral and many 
other important public buildings. In the " dirt-bed " resting 
upon the Oolitic strata numerous specimens of petrified wood 
are found, some of great size. The soil, though shallow, is 
fertile, and mutton fed on the grass has a peculiar rich flavour. 
Quarrying, fishing and agriculture are the chief industries. 
Several curious local customs are retained by the inhabitants. 

A joint railway of the Great Western and London & South 
Western companies runs south from Weymouth to Portland 
(4} m.) and Easton (8£ m.) on the isle. The isle contains a 
convict prison with accommodation for about. 1500 prisoners. 
Portland Castle, built by Henry VIII. in 1520, is generally 
occupied by the commander of the engineers or of the regiment 
stationed on the island. On a rock en the eastern side are 
remains of a more ancient fortress, Bow and Arrow Castle, 
ascribed to William Rufus. 

A harbour of refuge, begun in 1847 under the direction of the 
Admiralty, was completed some fifteen years later. A breakwater 
stretching in a northerly direction from the north-east corner of the 
island partially enclosed a large area of water naturally sheltered on 
the south and west. An inner arm ran nearly east from the island 
and terminated in a m'asonry head and fort, and an outer detached 
arm bent to the north and terminated in a circular fort, a narrow 
entrance for shipping being left between the two. It was formed 
of a rubble mound quarried by convict labour at the summit of the 
island, and was lowered by a wire-rope incline to the sea. The 
harbour thus made was open on the north to Weymouth and the 
Channel, p but the necessity for greater protection from torpedo 
attack made it advisable to complete the enclosure. Accordingly 
the Naval Works Acts of 1895 and subsequent years sanctioned 
works for closing the gap — about 2 m. long — between the end 
of the outer breakwater and the Bincleaves rocks near Weymouth, 
by two new breakwaters. One of these runs nearly east from the 
Bincleaves shore and is about 4642 ft. long, while from its extremity 
the other, about 4465 ft. long, stretches in a south-east _ direction 
towards the old outer breakwater, passages for navigation about 
700 ft. wide separating it from its neighbours at each end. These 
new structures also consist of rubble mounds. The defensive 
harbour thus completely enclosed has an area of 2200 acres to the 
one-fathom line, of which 1500 acres have a depth of not less than 
30 ft. at low water. There is no dockyard at Portland, but the 
watering and coaling arrangements for the supply of the fleet are of 
considerable importance. There is a coaling jetty and camber for the 
storage of both sea-borne and land-borne coal, with hydraulic 
appliances for handling it. The harbour and island are strongly 
fortified. 

The isle of Portland is not mentioned in the time of the 
Romans. In 837 it was the scene of an action against the Danes, 
and in 1052 it was plundered by Earl Godwine. In 1643 the 
parliamentary party made themselves masters of the island and 
castle, but shortly afterwards these were regained by the 
Royalists through a clever stratagem, and not recovered again 
by the forces of the parliament till 1646. 

PORTLANDIAN, in geology, a subdivision of the Upper 
Jurassic system that includes the strata lying between the 
Kimeridge Clay and the Purbeck beds. These rocks are well 
exposed on the isle of Portland, t Dorsetshire, where they have 
been quarried for more than 200 years. J. Mitchell appears 
to have been the first to use the term "Portland lime" in 
geological literature (1788); T. Webster spoke of the " Portland 
Oolite " in 181 2. In England the strata are very variable; the 
upper part consists principally of limestones, shelly, oolitic or 



122 



PORTLOCK— PORTMANTEAU 



compact, or in places very closely resembling chalk (Upway, 
Portisham, Brill, Chilmark). Nodules and layers of chert are 
well developed in some of the limestones of Dorsetshire and 
elsewhere; and a silicified oolite occurs near St Alban's Head. 
About Swindon, beds of sand are common in the Upper Portland 
beds with layers of calcareous sandstone (Swindon stone). 
Marly and sandy beds occur also at Shotover Hill. The lower 
portion is usually sandy and shows a gradual passage into the 
underlying Kimeridge Clay. \V. H. Fitton in 1827 gave the 
name "Portland Sand" to this division. The Upper Port- 
landian in Dorsetshire is 130-170 ft. thick; the Lower Portlandian 
in the same district is 100-120 ft. These rocks crop out from 
South Dorsetshire into Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckingham- 
shire, and possibly extend beneath younger rocks into Bedford- 
shire and Cambridgeshire. They have heen proved by borings 
in Sussex and Kent, arid in Yorkshire they are represented 
by part of the Speeton Clays, and in Lincolnshire by part of 
the Spilsby Sand. At Swindon and Aylesbury a conglomeratic 
layer with small pebbles of lydite and phosphatized fossils lies 
at the base of the Portland Stone. 

The Upper Portlandian of England is characterized by the 
ammonite Perisphinctes giganteus, along with Cytheria (Cyrena) 
rugosa, Trigonia gibbosa, Perisphinctes boloniensis and Trigonia 
incurva as subzonal forms. Olcostephanus gigas is the zonal 
ammonite in the Lower Portlandian, associated with Trigonia 
Pellatiy Cyprina Brongniarti, Exogyra brantrutana and Astarte 
Saemanni as subzonal indices. Other characteristic fossils 
are Cerithium portlandicum, the casts of which form the familiar 
" Portland screw," Isastraea oblonga,the Chelonian Stegochelys; 
the remains of saurian s Pliosaurus and Cimoliosaurus and others 
are found; Mesodon, Ischyodus and other fishes occur in this 
formation. The Portland limestones have been much in 
demand for building purposes; at Portland the " Top Roach," 
the " Whit Bed" or top freestone, and the " Best Bed" (or 
Base Bed) are the best known. In the Vale of Wardour the 
lower Portlandian has been largely quarried; the stone from 
this neighbourhood is often described as Wardour, Tisbury or 
Chilmark stone. Swindon stone is a calcareous sandstone that 
occurs in the sands of the Upper Portland beds near Swindon. 

Rocks of Portlandian age are well developed on the continent of 
Europe t but the grouping of the strata is different in some respects 
from that adopted by English geologists. In France the " Port- 
landian M is "usually taken to include the Purbeckian as well as the 
equivalents of the English Portland beds, and some^ authors, e.g. 
E. Renevier, have included more or less of the Kimeridgian in this 
division. The Portlandian of north-west Germany includes the 
Eimbeckhauser Plattenkalk and the Lower Portland Kalk. Oppel's 
" Tithonian " (tithonic) division, embracing Upper Kimeridge beds, 
Portlandian and Purbeckian beds in the Alpine district, is now 
recognized as a deeper water deposit of this time with many points 
of resemblance to the Russian development to which the name 
" Volgian" has been applied by S. Nikitin. The^ Portlandian beds 
of Yorkshire are more nearly related to the Volgian phase than to 
the beds of the same age in the south of England. The term Bono- 
nian ( = Bolonian) was suggested by J. F. Blake in 1881 for a part of 
the Portlandian series, from their occurrence at Boulogne (Bononia) 
where they are similar to the beds of Dorset. He limited the name 
Portlandian to the Purbeckian and Upper Portlandian (Portland 
stone), while he placed the Portland Sands and upper part of the 
Kimeridge Clay in his Bolonian division: this scheme has not been 
accepted in England. See Jurassic. 

PORTLOCK, JOSEPH ELLISON (1 794-1 864), British geologist 
and soldier, the only son of Nathaniel Portlock, captain in the 
Royal Navy, was born at Gosport on the 30th of September 
1794. Educated at the Royal Military Academy he entered 
the Royal Engineers in 1813. In 1814 he took part in the 
frontier operations in Canada. In 1824 he was selected by 
Colonel (afterwards Major-General) T. F.Colby (1784-1852) 
to take part in Ordnance Survey of Ireland. He was engaged 
for* several years in the trigonometrical branch, and subse- 
quently compiled information on the physical aspects, geology 
and economic products of Ireland. In 1837 he formed at Belfast 
a geological and statistical office, a museum for geological 
and zoological specimens, and a laboratory for the examina- 
tion of soils. The work was then carried on by Portlock as 






the geological branch of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, and 
the chief results were embodied in his Report on the Geology of 
the County of Londonderry and of parts of Tyrone and Fermanagh 
(1843), an elaborate and well-illustrated volume in which he was 
assisted by Thomas Oldham. After serving in Corfu and at 
Portsmouth he was, in 1849, appointed Commanding Royal 
Engineer at Cork, and from 1851-1856 he was Inspector of 
Studies at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. For a 
short time commanding officer at Dover, when the Council of 
Military Education was formed in 1857 he was selected as a 
member. 

During these years of active service he contributed num- 
erous geological papers to the scientific societies of Dublin 
and to the British Association. He published in 1848 a useful 
treatise on geology in Weale's " Rudimentary Series" (3rd. ed., 
1853). He was president of the geological section of the British 
Association at Belfast (1852), and of the Geological Society of 
London (1856-1858). He wrote a Memoir of the late Major- 
General Colby, with a Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the 
Trigonometrical Survey (reprinted in 1869 from Papers o\ 
Subjects connected with the Royal Engineers, vols, iii.-v 
He also contributed several articles on military subjects t< 
the 8th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. He w; 
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1837. He died i 
Dublin on the 14th of February 1864. 

PORT MAHON, or Mahon (Spanish Puerto Mahdn), the 
capital and principal seaport of Minorca, in the Spanish 
province of the Balearic Islands. Pop. (1900), 17,144. Port 
Mahon is situated on the east coast, at the head of a deep inle 
which extends inland for 3! m. It is an important harbou: 
(see Minorca). The city occupies a conspicuous hill, anc 
presents a fine appearance from the sea; it is solidly built 
excellent stone. Many of the houses date from the Britis] 
occupation, which has also left curious traces in the custom: 
and speech of the people. The King's Island (Isla del Rey 
so called as the landing-place of Alphonso III. of Aragon in 
1287) contains a hospital built by the admiral of the British 
squadron In 1722; farther south-east on the shore is the village 
of Villa Carlos or George Town, with ruins of extensive British 
barracks; and at the mouth of the port, on the same side, arc 
the remains of Forte San Felipe, originally erected by Charles V 
and twice the scene of the capitulation of British troops. Oppo 
site San Felipe is the easily defended peninsula of La 
(256 ft. high), which is occupied by extensive Spanish fortifi 
cations. Mahon is one of the principal quarantine stations 
Spain; the lazaretto, erected between 1798 and 1803, stands 
a long tongue of land, separated from La Mola by the inlet o] 
Cala Taulera. The principal modern buildings are the military 
and naval hospitals, the theatre, museum, library and schools, 
There are an arsenal and extensive quays. From its position 
on the route of vessels plying between Algeria and the south of 
France, the harbour is much frequented by French cargo- 
steamers; it is also a Spanish naval station. The principal 
exports are grain, live stock and fruit; cement, coal, iron 
machinery, flour, raw cotton and hides are imported. Shoe; 
and cotton and woollen goods are manufactured. About 2 
vessels enter the port every year, and the annual value of th 
foreign trade is, approximately, £200,000 to £250,000. 

Mahon is the ancient Portus Magonis, which under the^ Roman; 
was a municipium (Mun. flavium magontanum), probably includinj 
the whole island under its authority. As the name suggests, it ha< 
previously been a Carthaginian settlement. The Moors, wh 
occupied Minorca in the 8th century, were expelled by James 
of Aragon in 1232. Khair-ed-Din Barbarossa besieged and capture) 
the city in 1535; and in 1558 it was sacked by a corsair called Piali 
The British, who under James Stanhope, afterwards Earl Stanhope, 
seized the island in 1708, made Mahon a flourishing city, and ir 
1718 declared it a free port. In 1756 it fell into the hands ofth< 
French through the failure of Admiral Byng to relieve the garrisoi 
of St Philip's (San Felipe). Restored to the British in 1762, it wa 
in 1782 heroically but unsuccessfully defended by General Murray 
In 1802 it was finally ceded to Spain by the treaty of Amiens. 

PORTMANTEAU, a leather case or trunk for carrying article; 
of personal use when travelling. The typical portmanteau 



PORTO ALEGRE— PORTO MAURIZIO 



123 



the present day has two compartments which, fastened at the 
back by hinges, close together like a book. The original port- 
manteau (adopted from Fr. portetnanteou, porter, to carry, 
manteau, cloak, mantle) was a flexible round leather case to hold 
a cloak or other garment and of such a shape as could conveni- 
ently be carried on a rider's saddle. In French the word was 
also applied to a bracket or set of pegs on which to hang clothes. 
C. L. Dodgson (" Lewis Carroll ") in Through the Looking Glass 
(*' The Song of the Jabberwock ") used the expression " port- 
manteau word " of an invented word composed of two words 
run together and supposed to convey humorously the combined 
meaning: thus " slithy " conveys slimy and lithe; " mimsy," 
flimsy and miserable. 

PORTO ALEGRE, a city and port of Brazil, capital of the 
state of Rio Grande do Sul, at the northern extremity of Lag6a 
dos Patos on the eastern shore of an estuary called Rio Guahyba, 
about 160 m. from the port of Rio Grande do Sul at the entrance 
to the lake. The population which contains a large foreign 
clement, chiefly German and Italian, was returned as 73,574 
by the census of 1900, including some outlying districts not 
within urban limits. The municipio (commune), which has 
an area of 931 sq. m., had a population of nearly 100,000, in- 
cluding a large number" of prosperous colonists. The railway 
from Porto Alegre to Novo Hamburgo and Taquara (55 m.) 
affords an outlet for some of the older German colonies. The 
railway from Porto Alegre to Uruguayana is completed from 
Margem da Taquary to Cacequy, 232 m. Its starting point, 
Margem da Taquary, is about 80 m. from the city, with which 
it is connected by river steamers. An extension of the railway 
is projected from Margem da Taquary to Neustadt on the Novo 
Hamburgo line, and will give the city direct railway connexion 
with the principal cities of western and southern Rio Grande 
do Sul. The Rio Guahyba, which is not a river, was once called 
I Viamao " because its outline is roughly that of the human 
hand, the rivers entering the estuary at its head corresponding 
to the fingers. The lower channels of these rivers (the Gravaty, 
Sinos, Cahy, Jacuhy and Taquary) are all navigable and bring 
considerable trade to the port. Its foreign trade is limited to 
light-draught steamers able to cross the bar at the entrance to 
the lake. 

The city occupies a tongue of land projecting into the estuary, 
and extends along its shores and back to a low wooded hill. Its 
site, as seen from the water, is attractive, though its larger part 
is an almost level plain. There are pleasant suburbs along the shore 
and farther inland (Floresta, Gloria, Moinhos de Vento, i.e. 
" Windmills," Navigantes and Partenon). The climate is sub- 
tropical, cool and bracing in winter but insufferably hot in summer. 
The mean annual temperature is slightly under 69 ° F., the average 
maximum being a little over 82 ° and the average minimum 59 °. 
The annual rainfall is about 30 J in. The city is regularly laid out 
with broad, straight, well-paved streets, in great part lined with 
shady trees. The waterside streets, however, follow the curve of 
the beach. There are several public souares and gardens, the more 
important being the Praca Harmoma, the Praca d'Alfandega, 
Praca da Independencia and the Parque, where an exposition was 
held in 1901. The public water supply is drawn from a range of 
hills 6 m. distant^ and is considered good. Porto Alegre, like 
many Brazilian cities, is in a transition stage, and handsome new 
structures of French and Italian styles rise from among the low, 
heavy and plain old buildings of Portuguese origin. Brick and 
broken stone are chiefly used in the walls, which are plastered out- 
side and tinted. Tiles are used for roofing, and on modern edifices 
stucco ornamentation is lavishly employed. The most noteworthy 
public buildings are the Cathedral (Porto Alegre being the see of a 
Roman Catholic bishop), the handsome church of Nossa Senhora 
das Dores, the municipal palace, school of engineering, government 
palace, legislative halls, school of medicine, athenaeum, normal 
school and public library and military barracks. One of the hos- 
pitals—that of Caridade— is the largest in the state. The city is the 
chief commercial centre of the state and has shipyards for the con- 
struction of river and lake vessels. It manufactures cotton fabrics, 
boots and shoes, iron safes and stoves, carriages, furniture, butter and 
cheese, macaroni, preserves, candles, soap and paper. 

Porto Alegre was founded in 1743 by immigrants from the 
Azores and was at first known as Porto dos Cazaes. Owing to 
the occupation of the southern part of the captaincy by the 
Spaniards, Governor Jose Marccllino de Figuereido selected this 
village in 1770 as his official residence and gave to it the name it I 



now bears. It was made a villa in 1803, and in 1807, when Rio 
Grande do Sul was made a captaincy-general, the transfer of 
the capital from Rio Grande to Porto Alegre was officially 
recognized. In 1822 it was raised to the rank of a city, and in 
1841, as a reward for its loyalty in revolutionary wars of that 
province, it was distinguished by the title of leal e valorosa 
(loyal and valorous). The first German immigrants to settle 
near Porto Alegre arrived in 1825, and much of its prosperity and 
commercial standing is due to the German element. 

PORTOCARRERO, LUIS MANUEL FERNANDEZ DE 
(1635-1700), cardinal archbishop of Toledo, was a younger son 
of the marquis of Almenara and was born On the 8th of January 
1635. He beCame dean of Toledo early, and was made cardinal 
on the 5th of August 1669. Till 1677 he lived at Rome as 
cardinal protector of the Spanish nation. In 1677 he was ap- 
pointed interim viceroy of Sicily, counsellor of state and arch- 
bishop of Toledo. He ceased to be viceroy of Sicily in 1678. 
As archbishop of Toledo he exerted himself to protect the clergy 
from the obligation to pay the excises or octroi duties known as 
" the millions" and thereby helped to perpetuate the financial 
embarrassments of the government. His position rather than 
any personal qualities enabled him to play an important part in 
a great crisis of European politics. The decrepit King Charles II. 
was childless, and the disposal of his inheritance became a 
question of great interest to the European powers. Porto- 
carrero was induced to become a supporter of the French party, 
which desired that the crown should be left to one of the family 
of Louis XIV., and not to a member of the king's own family, 
the Habsburgs. The great authority of Portocarrero as cardinal 
and primate of Spain was used to persuade, or rather to terrify 
the unhappy king into making a will in favour of the duke of 
Anjou, Philip V. He acted as regent till the new king reached 
Spain and hoped to be powerful under his rule. But the king's 
French advisers were aware that Spain required a thorough 
financial and administrative reform. Portocarrero could not 
see, and indeed had not either the intelligence or the honesty 
to see, the necessity. He was incapable, obstinate and per- 
fectly selfish. The new rulers soon found that he frnust be 
removed and he was ordered to return to his diocese. When 
in 1706 the Austrian party appeared likely to gain the upper 
hand, Portocarrero was led by spite and vexation to go over to 
them. When fortune changed he returned to his allegiance to 
Philip V., and as the government was unwilling to* offend the 
Church he escaped banishment. In 1709 when Louis XIV. 
made a pretence of withdrawing from the support of his grand- 
son, the cardinal made a great display of loyalty. He died on 
the 14th of September and by his orders the w-ords Hie jacet 
pulvis, cinis, ei nihil were put on his tomb.

PORTO FARINA, a town of Tunisia about 20 m. E. of Bizerta, 
on the Ghar-el-Mela, a lagoon, also known as the Lake of Porto 
Farina, at the mouth of the Mejerda (the ancient Bagradas). 
Porto Farina was the naval arsenal of the piratical beys of 
Tunis and was bombarded by the English under Admiral Blake 
in 1655. The lagoon has become very shallow in consequence 
of the silt brought down by the Mejerda. The town has ceased 
to be important, and its inhabitants have dwindled to about 
1500. The ruins 10 m. to the south-west, near the village of 
Bu Shater, are identified with the ancient Utica (q.v.). 

PORTO MAURIZIO, a city of Liguria, Italy, the capital of 
the province of Porto Maurizio, on the coast of the Ligurian 
Sea, 46 m. by rail E. of Nice and 70 m. S.W. of Genoa, 115 ft. 
above sea-level. Pop. (1901), 7207. It consists of a picturesque 
old town on the heights and a modern town of villas on the lower 
slopes. The principal church, designed by Gaetano Cantone, 
is a large structure of 1780 with a dome rebuilt in 1821. A few 
remains of the old city walls may be seen. About 2 m. north- 
cast of Porto Maurizio is the town of Oneglia, with a fine church, 
S. Giovanni Battista, designed hy Gaetano Amoretti, a hospital 
(1785) and a large prison. It suffered considerably from the 
earthquake of 1887. Maurizio and Oneglia lie on the same bay

and both have small but safe harbours, "both are frequented 
for sea-bathing, and both are embowered amid olive groves; 
and the district is famous for the quality of its oil. The two 
towns together form one commune, called imperia, which had 
a population of 1 5,459 in 1907. 

Porto Maurizio appears as Portus Maurici in the Maritime Itiner- 
ary. After being subject to the marquises of Turin (nth century) 
and of Clavesana, it was sold by Boniface of Clavesana in 1288 to 
Genoa in return for a yearly payment; in 1354 it became the seat 
of the Genoese vicar of the western Riviera, and remained in the 
possession of the republic till it was merged in the kingdom of 
Sardinia. Oneglia, formerly situated inland at the place called 
Castelvecchio (old castle), has occupied its present site from about 
935. The bishops of Albenga sold it in 1298 to the Dorias of Genoa, 
who in their turn disposed of it in 1576 to Emanuel Philibert of Savoy. 
In the wars of the house of Savoy Oneglia often changed hands. 
In 1 6 14 and 1640, the Spaniards and in 1623 and 1672 the Genoese 
obtained possession; in 1602 it had to repulse an attack by a French 
squadron; in 1 744-1 745 it was again occupied by the Spaniards, 
and in 1792 bombarded and burned by the French. Pellegrino 
Amoretti, assistant secretary to Charles V., and Andrea Doria, the 
famous admiral, were natives of Oneglia.

PORTO NOVO, a town of British India, on the Coromandel 
coast in the South Arcot district of Madras. Pop. (1901), 
13,712. The English began trading here in 1683, when they 
found both the Danes and the Portuguese already established. 
The place is chiefly famous for the battle in July 1 781, in which 
Sir Eyre Coote with 8000 men defeated Hyder Ali with 60,000 
and saved the Madras presidency. In 1830 an attempt, finally 
unsuccessful mainly owing to the lacH of fuel, was made to 
smelt iron from the ores found in the vicinity. 

PORTO-RICHE, GEORGES DE (1840- ), French dramatist, 
was born at Bordeaux. When he was twenty his pieces in verse 
began to be produced at the Parisian theatres; he also wrote 
some books of verse which met with a favourable reception, 
but these early works were not reprinted. In 1898 he published 
Thidlre d'atnour, which contained four of his best pieces, La 
Chance de Framboise, L'Infidele, Amour euse, Le Passe* . The 
title given to this collection indicates the difference between 
the plays of Porto-Riche and the political or sociological pieces 
of many of his contemporaries. In Germaine, the passionate 
and exacting heroine of Atnoureuse, Mme Rejane found one of 
her best parts. In Les Malefildtres (Odeon, 1904), also a drama 
of passion, the characters are drawn from the working classes. 

PORTO RICO, or Puerto Rico (" Rich Harbour "), an 
island of the United States of America, the most easterly and 
the fourth in size of the Greater Antilles, situated between 
17 50' and 18 30' N., and between 65 30' and 67 15' W., 
about 70 m. E. of Haiti, and 500 m. E. by S. of Cuba. It is 
about 100 m. long from east to west, 40 m. wide near the west 
end, and somewhat narrower towards the east end, and has an 
area of 3435 sq. m. 

Physical Features. — A range of mountains, varying in height 
from 2000 ft. to about 3750 ft. on El Yunque Peak in the north- 
east corner, traverses the island from west to east and descends 
abruptly to the sea at each end. The south slope rises precipi- 
tously from the foothills; the north slope is more gradual, but it is 
much broken by rugged spurs and deep gorges. On the north there 
is little coastal plain except at the mouths of rivers, but on the 
south coast there is a plain of considerable extent broken only b>y 
the remains ol eroded foothills. The water parting is about twice 
as far from the north coast as it is from the south^ coast, the rain- 
fall is greater on the north slope, and the principal rivers — Rio 
Loiza, Rio de la Plata, Rio Manati and Rio Arecibo are on the north 
side. There are eight other rivers on the same side, seventeen 
on the south side, six at the east end and four at the west end, 
besides more than 1200 smaller streams, and the deep valleys 
cut by the streams add to the broken surface of the country. None 
of the rivers is navigable for more than a mile or two from the coast. 
The coast-line has few indentations sufficient to afford safe harbour- 
age. Under the same jurisdiction as Porto Rico are the fertile 
island of Vieques (21 m. long and 6 m. wide) and the smaller and 
nearly barren island of Culebra off the east coast, the island of 
Mona, covered with deposits of guano, off the west coast, and 
numerous islets. 

Fauna. — The native fauna is scanty. The agouti and the 
armadillo are practically extinct and the only other mammals 
are ground squirrels, rats, a few other small rodents, and some bats. 
A huge land-turtle is peculiar to the island. Reptiles are scarce, 



and venomous reptiles unknown. Noxious Insects are less numeroi 
than is usual in tropical countries. There are no large game bird^ 
but song birds and doves are numerous on the mountains, an< 
flamingoes and other water-birds frequent the coast. There are 
few species of fresh-water fish, but food -fishes are scarce both i: 
the rivers and alongthe coast. 

Flora. — The flora is beautiful and varied. The more rugged 
districts and higher elevations are clad with such tropical forest 
trees as ebony, Spanish cedar, sandalwood, rosewood and mahogany. 
There are several species of palms, flowering trees, trees with 
beautifully coloured foliage, tree ferns, resinous trees and trees 
bearing tropical fruits. There are about thirty species of medicinal 
plants, twelve used for condiments, and twelve for dyes and tanning 
In the semi-arid districts on the south slope of the mountain: 
the flora consists chiefly of dry grasses, acacias, yuccas and cactus 

Climate. — The climate is somewhat more healthy than that 
the other West Indies. The temperature is moderated by th 
north-east trade winds, which, somewhat modified by local con- 
ditions, blow throughout the year, briskly during the day and moi 
mildly during the night. It rarely reaches ioo° F. or falls bekr 
50 , and the mean annual temperature is about 8o° (75*2° ii 
January, 80*4° in August). The mean daily variation at San Juan 
is ii*5 ; on the mountains the mean daily variation is 23 . The

El Yunque Mountain, is 120 in. or more, while other districts j 
semi-arid or subject to severe droughts. At San Juan the average 
annual rainfall is about 55in.; nearly two-thirds of this falls from 
June to November inclusive. Most of the rain is in showers, 
frequently < heavy; and on the windward slope showers are an 
almost daily occurrence. The island is^visited occasionally by 
hurricanes. 

Soil. — Close to the coast the soil is for the most part a coral 
sand. Farther inland in the level districts and river bottoms it 
varies from a sandy to a clay loam containing much alluvium. 
On the foothills and in the less rugged mountain districts there 
is a thin but rich clay soil derived from coral limestone. 

Industries. — A little more than one-fourth of the land is under 
cultivation and in 1809 more than three-fifths of the working popu- 
lation were engaged in agriculture. There were over 39,000 farms, 
nearly all of them small, and the average number of acres cultivated 
on each was not more than fifteen. Sugar on the lowlands, coffee 
on the upper, and tobacco on the lower mountain slopes are the 
principal crops. In 1909 there were 185,927 acres of sugar, yielding 
244,257 tons for exportation, and valued at $18,432,446. The 
coffee plantations were greatly injured by a severe hurricane 
which visited the island on the 8th of August 1899, but the yield 
for export increased from 12,157,240 lb in 1901 to 38,756,750 lb, 
valued at $4,693,004, in 1907. The acreage, however, decreased 
from 178,155 acres in 1906 to 155,778 acres in 1909, and in the latter 
year the crop fell to 28,489,263 lb. Java coffee has been grown 
with success in Porto Rico. Tobacco of a superior quality is grown 
extensively on the lower northern slopes and much tobacco is now 
grown under cloth. The total acreage of tobacco increased from 
12,871 acres in 1906 to 27,596 acres in 1909; the total value of the 
exported tobacco products increased from $681,642 in 1901 to 
$5,634,130 in 1909. Cotton, Indian corn, sweet potatoes, yams 
and rice are small crops. The culture of citrus fruits, principally 
oranges and grape-fruit, and of pineapples and coco-nuts has been 
rapidly extended. About 13,000 head of cattle were exported 
annually from 1901 to 1905, but much of the best grazing land 
has since been devoted to the cultivation of sugar-cane. A project 
for irrigating the district south of the mountains between Ponce 
and Patillas was adopted by the Porto Rican government in 1909. 
The Federal government has an agricultural experiment station 
at Mayaguez.

The mineral resources are very limited. Brick clay and lime- 
stone arc abundant, and there arc on the south coast a sand marl 
rich in phosphates and productive salt deposits. Iron ore, lignite, 
copper, mercury, molybdenite, nickel, platinum and other minerals 
have been found, but the quantity of each is too small, or the 
quality too poor, for them to be of commercial value. There are 
important mineral and thermal springs in various parts of £he 
island. 

The only manufacturing industries of much importance are the 
preparation of sugar, coffee and tobacco for market, and the 
manufacture of cigars, cigarettes, straw hats, soap, matches, 
vermicelli, sash, doors, ice, distilled liquors and some machinery. 

Transport facilities arc inadequate. The American Railroad 
of 1'orto Rico, about 190 m. long, connects the principal cities 
along the north and west coasts and those as far east as Ponce 
on the south coast; a railway between Ponce and Guayama, 
farther cast, was virtually completed in 1910, and the Vega A!ta 
railroad connects Vega Alta with Dorado on the north coast; 
but there are no inland railways and most of the products of the 
interior are carried to the coast in carts drawn by bullocks or on 
the backs of mules. The mileage of wagon roads was increased 
from about 170 m. in 1898 to 612 m. in 1909. The principal har- 
bours are San Juan on the north and Ponce on the south coast; 
rhe former is accessible to vessels of about 30 ft. draught, and the 
latter has a natural channel which admits vessels of 25 ft. draught. 
Two lines of steamboats afford regular communication between San 
Juan and New York; one of them runs to Venezuelan ports and one 
to New Orleans ; and there are lines to Cuba and direct to Spain. 

The commerce of Porto Rico is principally with the United 
States. The value of its exports to the United States increased 
from $5,581,288 in the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June 
iqoi to 826,998,542 in 1909, and the value of its imports from the 
United States increased during this period^ from $7,413,502 to 
$25,163,678. In the meantime the value of its exports to foreign 
countries increased only from $3,002,679 to $4,565,598, and the 
value of its imports from foreign countries only from $1,952,728 
to $3,054,318. 

Population. — The population iricreased from 583,308 in i860 
to 798,565 in 1887, and to 953,243, or 277-5 per sq, m., in 1899. 
Of the total population in 1899, 589,426, or 61 -8% were whites, 
304,352 were of mixed blood, 59,390 were negroes and 75 
were Chinese. In 1910 the census returned the population as 
i,i 1 8,oi 2. The proportion of whites is greater at the west 
end than at the east end, greater on the north side than on 
the south side, and greater in the interior than along the coast. 
Only 13,872, or about 1-5% of the total population of 1899, 
were foreign-born, and of these more than one-half were born 
in Spain. The married portion of the population was only 
16.6% in 1899. The principal towns, with the population of 
each in 19 10, are: San Juan, 48,716; Ponce, 35,027; Mayagucz, 
16,591; Arecibo, 9612. The Roman Catholic is the predominant 
church and the bishopric of Porto Rico (1512) is one of the 
oldest in the New World. 

Government. — The constitution of Porto Rico is contained in 
an act of the Congress of the United States (the Foraker Act) 
which came into operation in May 1900. The governor is 
appointed by the president of the United States with the advice 
and consent of the Senate for a term of four years, and associated 
with the governor is an, executive council consisting of the 
secretary, treasurer, auditor, attorney-general, commissioner 
of the interior, commissioner of education, and five other 
members, all appointed in the same manner and for the same 
term as the governor. The constitution requires that at least 
five of the eleven members of the Executive Council shall be 
native inhabitants of Porto Rico; in practice the six members 
who are also heads of the administrative departments have been 
Americans while the other five have been Porto Ricans. The 
insular government, however, has created a seventh administra- 
tive department — that of health, charities and corrections — and 
requires that the head of this shall be chosen by the governor 
from among the five members of the Executive Council who 
are not heads of the other departments. 

The Executive Council constitutes one branch of the legislative 
assembly; the House of Delegates the other. The House of Dele- 
gates consists of 35 members elected biennially, five from each of 
seven districts. The right to determine the electoral franchise is 
vested in the legislature itself and that body has conferred it upon 
practically all adult males. The governor has the right to veto 
any bill, and for passing a bill over his veto an affirmative vote 



of two-thirds of the members of each house is required. All laws 
enacted by the insular legislature must also be submitted to the 
Congress of the United States, which reserves the right to annul 
them. Railway, street railway, telegraph and telephone franchises 
can be granted only by the Executive Council with the approval 
of the governor, and none can be operative until it has been approved 
by the President of the United States. The governor and Executive 
Council have the exclusive right to grant all other franchises of a 
public or quasi-public nature and Congress reserves the right to 
annul or modify any such grant. , 

The administration of justice is vested in a United States district 
court and a supreme court, district courts, municipal courts and 
justice of the peace courts of Porto Rico. The judge of the United 
States district court and the chief justice and associate justices 
of the supreme court are appointed by the President with the 
consent of the Senate, and the judges of the* district courts by the 
governor with the consent of the Executive Council. 

The principal local government is that of the municipalities or 
municipal districts, but for the Spanish municipal government the 
insular legislature has substituted one resembling that of small 
towns in the United States, and it has reduced the number of dis- 
tricts from 66 to 47. Each municipal district elects biennially a 
mayor and a municipal council, the membership of which varies from 
five to nine according to the population of the district. The mayor 
appoints practically all municipal employes and may veto any 
ordinance of the council; his veto, however, may be overridden by 
two-thirds of the council. The police force of each municipality, 
or rather of each of 66 police districts, is maintained and controlled 
by the insular government; justice in each municipality is also 
administered by the insular government; the building, maintenance 
and repair of public roads are under the management of a board of 
three road supervisors in each of the seven insular election districts; 
and matters pertaining to education are for the most part under 
the insular commissioner of education and a school board of three 
members elected biennially in each municipality; nearly all other 
local affairs are within the jurisdiction of the mayor and municipal 
council. 

Education. — In 1899 more than three-fourths of the inhabitants 
ten years of age or over were unable to read or write, and when 
in the following year the present system of government was estab- 
lished large powers were given to the commissioner of education. 
He controls the expenditure of public money for school purposes, 
the examination and the appointment of teachers, whose nomina- 
tions by the municipal school boards are referred to the commis- 
sioner. The school system comprises preparatory schools, rural 
schools, graded schools, three high schools and the university of 
Porto Rico. The university at Rio Piedras was established by 
act of the insular legislature in 1903, but in 19 10 only two depart- 
ments had been organized — the insular normal school and the 
department of agriculture. Numerous scholarships have been 
established at government expense in Porto Rican schools and in 
colleges or universities of the United States. The average daily 
attendance in the public schools increased^ from 47,277 in 1906- 
1907 to 74,522 in 1 908-1 909. Each municipality is required to 
pay to its school board 25% of its receipts from the general 
property tax. 

Finance. — Trade between Porto Rico and the United States 
is free, but upon imports to Porto Rico from foreign countries 
the Federal government collects custom duties and pays the net 
proceeds to the insular government. Other principal sources of 
income are excise taxes, a general property tax, an inheritance 
tax and a tax on insurance premiums. For the fiscal year ending 
June 1909 the net income of the insular government was 
$3,180,111-75 and the net bonded indebtedness was $3,759,231*22. 

History. — On his second voyage Columbus sighted the island, 
to which he gave the name San Juan Bautista, and remained 
in its vicinity from the 17th to the 22nd of November 1493. 
In 1508 Nicolas de Ovando, governor of Hispaniola , (Haiti) 
rewarded the services of Juan Ponce de Leon, one of Columbus's 
companions in 1493, by permitting him to explore the island, 
then called by the natives " Borinquen," and search for its 
reputed deposits of gold. Ponce's hospitable reception by the 
native chief, Aquebana or Guaybana, and his fairly profitable 
search for the precious metal led King Ferdinand in 1509 to give 
him an appointment as temporary governor of the island, where 
his companions had already established the settlement of 
Caparra (Pueblo Viejo, near the present San Juan). In 1510 
the king through Ovando's influence made this commission 
permanent. Meanwhile Ferdinand had also restored to Diego 
Columbus, son of the discoverer, the privileges of his father, 
including the control of the islands of Haiti and Porto Rico. 
The new admiral removed Ponce and appointed Juan Cer6n 
to administer the affairs of Porto Rico. The quarrels between 
these two leaders disturbed the affairs of the island for the next

two years, but in the end Ponce was forced to yield the political 
control to the representatives of Columbus. While Ponce was 
exploring Florida in 15 13 the conquerors of Porto Rico had 
established their domination in the upper western portion of 
the island by a series of settlements. The ruthless methods by 
which the Spaniards forced the natives to labour for them caused 
a change in the attitude of the erstwhile friendly Borinquenos. 
Both Ponce and his rivals had introduced the system of repar- 
timientos established by Columbus in Haiti. A preliminary 
distribution of 1060 natives in 1500-1510 was the direct pre- 
cursor of the rebellion of the natives in 1511. For a time the 
Borinquenos, aided by Caribs from the neighbouring islands, 
threatened to destroy all vestiges of white occupation in Porto 
Rico, but in the end the Spaniards prevailed. Immediately 
after this rebellion a second distribution of more than 4000 
natives foreshadowed the rapid disappearance of those un- 
fortunates, despite the well-meaning regulations of the Council 
of the Indies. For some decades the inevitable extermination 
was postponed by the fact that the Spaniards were not numerous 
enough to occupy the southern and eastern portions of the 
island. Here a remnant of the Borinquenos, assisted by the 
Caribs, maintained a severe struggle with the conquerors, but in 
the end their Indian allies were subdued by English and French 
corsairs, and the unfortunate natives of Porto Rico were left 
alone to experience the full effect of forced labour, disastrous 
hurricanes, natural plagues and new diseases introduced by the 
conquerors. By 1520 philanthropic churchmen directed their 
attention to the miserable conditions of the natives; hut remedial 
legislation was largely nullified by the rapacity of subordinate 
officials, and before the end of the 16th century the natives 
disappeared as a distinct race. 

To replace the natives as a labour element and also to preserve 
them from extermination African slavery was early permitted, 
and by 1530 there were over 1500 negro slaves in Porto Rico. 
Although the extravagant prices paid at first almost ruined the 
planters, the traffic continued to flourish in hands of foreign 
concessionaires until 1820, when through English influence it 
was abandoned. At this period negroes were an important 
element of the population, but by no means the most 
numerous one. 

At no period of its history has Porto Rico enjoyed great 
prosperity. Besides the causes already indicated the evil 
character of many of the white, settlers conspired to retard its 
development. In 1515 its European population may have 
been 400. Until 1782 the island was divided into the eastern 
district of Puerto Rico and the western one of San German. 
In 1 5 13 the arrival of its first bishop, who later also exercised 
the function of general inquisitor, added one more to the dis- 
cordant elements ruling the island. About 1520 Caparra was 
abandoned for a more healthy site, and the city of San Juan 
de Puerto Rico was founded as the capital of the eastern district. 
In time Puerto Rico became the name of the whole island. In 
1536 legislation for changing the method of general government 
and regulating common pasturages and public property caused 
extreme dissatisfaction, but for many years thereafter the 
form of control alternated between alcaldes selected by the 
inhabitants and annual governors appointed by the Council of 
the Indies. 

To the difficulties caused by disaster, depopulation and mal- 
administration there was added the danger of foreign invasion 
when war broke' out in Europe between Francis I. of France 
and the emperor Charles V. In 1528 San German was plun- 
dered by a French corsair and twenty-six years later utterly 
destroyed. In 1533 the jortaleza y now the governor's palace, 
was begun at San Juan, and in 1 530-1 584 Morro Castle 
was erected at the entrance of the harbour. Possibly these 
slight fortifications preserved the capital from the destruction 
which overwhelmed all the other settlements ; but these 
measures for defence were due more to the loyalty of the 
inhabitants than to the efforts of the home government, which 
at this time remained indifferent to appeals for help from the 
island. 



■ 



In 1595 San Juan was unsuccessfully attacked by an English 
fleet under Sir Francis Drake; two years later another English 
force, led by Sir George Cumberland, occupied the city for some 
weeks. The city was attacked in 1625 by a Dutch fleet, which 
was easily repulsed. The buccaneers or filibusters, who during 
the 17th century were drawn to the West Indies by the prospect 
of plundering the possessions of decadent Spain, often invaded 
Porto Rico, but that island escaped the conquest which Haiti 
experienced. The English attacked the island in 1678, 1702, 
1703 and 1743; and in 1797 an English force attempted to reduce 
San Juan, but was repulsed by the strong fortifications vigorous! 
manned by resident volunteers. After this event the city wa; 
permitted to add the words " very noble and very loyal " t< 
its coat of arms. 

Porto Rico was comparatively unaffected by the great Spanish 
American uprising of the early 19th century. During the 
struggle of Spain against Napoleon, the island, in common with 
the other American dominions, was represented in the Spanish 
Cortes and had its first legislative assembly. Trade with the 
United States was permitted in 181 5, although only in Spanish 
ships. The island suffered from the reactionary policy of 
Ferdinand VII., but the few sporadic attempts at revolution 
between 181 5 and 1820 were readily suppressed. Columbian 
insurgents made ineffectual attempts to invade the island 
during 1810-29. Governor Miguel de la Torre, who ruled the 
island with vice-regal powers during the second period of Ferdi- 
nand's absolutism, sternly repressed all attempts at liberalism, 
and made the island the resort for loyal refugees from the Spanish 
mainland. This policy, coupled with certain administrate 
and revenue reforms, and some private attempts in behalf o] 
public education, made the last seven years of his rule, froi 
1827 to 1834, the most prosperous in the Spanish regime. Th 
unsettled political condition of Spain during the next fort; 
years was reflected in the disturbed political conditions of Port 
Rico and Cuba. The suffrage was restricted, the Press was placed 
under a strict censorship, and the right of public assemblage 
was unknown. Economically the island in 1868 was in 
much worse condition than thirty years before. The Revolu 
tion of 1868 in Spain promised such salutary changes for the 
Antilles as the introduction of political parties, the restoration 
of representation in the Spanish Cortes, and the enfranchise- 
ment of the slaves; but the imprudent " Insurrection of Lares," 
and other outbreaks of 1867-68, delayed these anticipated 
reforms. The reactionaries feared separation from the mother 
country. Under the short-lived republican government i: 
Spain Porto Rico was in 1870-18 74 a province with a provincial 
deputation, and in 1873 slavery was abolished. After the 
restoration of the monarchy under Alphonso XII. there was 
some improvement in the commerce of the island, but political! 
it displayed all the evils of an obsolete system of administration 
disturbed by a premature liberalism. In 1877 the provincial 
deputation was re-established, but it was not until 1895 that 
the home government attempted, far too late, to enact a series 
of adequate reform measures, and in November 1897 followed 
this by a grant of autonomy. 

When in April 1898 war broke out between Spain and the 
United States the former strongly garrisoned the island, but 
the fortifications of the capital were largely of the massive stone 
construction that had repelled Abercrombie a century before, 
most of the artillery was of an obsolete pattern and the few 
cruisers in the harbour were antiquated in type. The American 
invasion of the island occurred in July. On the 25th of that 
month, while a few vessels made a demonstration before San 
Juan, the main American fleet was landing some 3400 troops 
under General Nelson A. Miles at Guanica, a small town on the 
southern shore, some 15 m. west of Ponce. Three days later 
the latter town surrendered, amid demonstrations of joy on 
the part of the inhabitants. The people seemed to regard the 
American flag as the harbinger of a new era. General Miles 's 
policy in affording employment for the natives likewise served 
to make the new American regime acceptable. 

Meanwhile the Spanish governor-general, Manuel Macias y

Casado, had ordered the forces under his command in the south- 
ern part of the island to fall back towards the ridge of mountains 
intersecting it from east to west, just north of the town of 
Coamo. Reinforcements were also brought up from San Juan 
and preparations made to resist an attack by the Americans, 
despite the current rumours of approaching peace. On their 
part the American forces, now numbering about 10,000 men, 
prepared to advance by separate routes across the island in 
four columns. Guayama, Mayaguezand Coamo were occupied; 
one portion of the army was within 20 m. of the northern coast 
and another had advanced along the main military road nearly 
to Aibonito, when the signing of the peace protocol on the 12th 
of August caused an immediate suspension of hostilities. The 
advance of the Americans had been rapid and decisive, with a 
small loss of life — three killed and forty wounded — due to the 
skill with which the military manoeuvres were planned and 
executed and the cordial welcome given the invaders by the 
inhabitants. By November the Spaniards had evacuated the 
greater part of the island; after Captain General Macias em- 
barked for Spain, General Ricardo Ortega was governor from 
the 1 6th to the 18th of October, when the island was turned over 
to the American forces. In the work of policing the island, 
in the accompanying tasks of sanitation, construction of high- 
ways and other public works, accounting for the expenditure 
of public funds, and in establishing a system of public education, 
the military control, which under the successive direction of 
Generals John R. Brooke, Guy V. Henry and George W. Davis, 
lasted until the 1st of May 1000, proved most effective in bridg- 
ing over the period of transfer from the repressive control of 
Spain to the semi-paternal system under the American civil 
government. But it was hardly adapted to teach a people 
utterly without political experience the essential elements of 
self-government. To meet this problem the Congress of the 
United States passed the " Foraker Act, " under which civil 
government was instituted, and which, with certain modifica- 
tions is still in force (see Administration). Under this act the 
American element has exercised the controlling power, and this 
has proved distasteful to certain Porto Rican politicians. 

On the 8th of August 1899 the island was visited by the 
most destructive cyclone in its history, causing a loss of about 
3500 lives and a property damage amounting to 36,000,000 
pesos, the coffee industry suffering most. This calamity 
afforded the American people an opportunity to display their 
generosity toward their new colony. Charles H. Allen became 
the first civil governor in May 1900; he was succeeded in August 
1 901 by William H. Hunt, who served until July 1904; Beekman 
Winthrop was governor in 1904- 190 7 and Regis H. Post from 
April 1907 until November 1909, when he was succeeded by 
George R. Colton. The island now has free trade with the 
United States, and receives into its general revenue fund all 
customs duties and internal taxes collected in the island. Its 
political leaders in the House of Delegates are restive under the 
control exercised by the Executive Council, but an attempt to 
hold up necessary appropriations resulted in the passage in 
July 1909 of an act continuing the appropriations of the previous 
year, whenever for any cause the lower house fails to pass 
the necessary financial legislation. In 1910 the coffee industry 
had not yet recovered from the effect of the cyclone of 1899 
and the unfortunate mortgage system that prevailed under the 
Spanish regime. The fact that its product is shut out of its 
natural markets, without gaining that of the United States, 
is also a great handicap. The civic status of the people is still 
unsettled, but there has been under American rule a notable 
advance in the well-being of the island.

PORTO TORRES (anc. Tunis Libisonis, q.v.), a seaport on 
the north coast of Sardinia, i2§ m. N.W. of Sassari by rail. Pop. 
(1901), 3762 (town); 4225 (commune). It is only 10 ft. above 
sea-level, and is malarious, but is a seaport of some importance, 
having regular steam communication with Ajaccio, Leghorn 
and Cagliari, and with the north and west coasts of Sardinia. 
The church of S. Gavino, formerly the cathedral, probably 
dates from the nth century. It is a Romanesque basilica 
with a nave and two aisles, divided by ancient columns; at 
each end of the nave is an apse. It has a 14th-century portal 
and two smaller doors at the sides added later in the Aragonese 
style. See D. Scano, Storia deW arte in Sardegna dal XI. al 
XIV. secolo (Cagliari-Sassari, 1907), 91 sqq. To the N.N.W. 
is the island of Asniara, the principal quarantine station of 
Italy. Porto Torres was the seat of the giudici of the north-west 
portion of the island (the district was called Torres or Logudoro) ; 
it was plundered by the Genoese in n 66, but remained the seat 
of the giudici until 1272, when it was divided between various 
Genoese families, the Doria, Malaspina, &c, and the giudici of 
Arborea. It was also the seat of a bishopric until 1441, when 
the see was transferred to Sassari, Porto Torres being practically 
deserted, owing to its unhealthiness. It did not become an 
independent commune again until 1842. 

PORTOVENERE (anc. Porlus Veneris), a town and summer 
resort of Liguria, Italy, in the province of Genoa, at the 
southern extremity of the peninsula which protects the Gulf 
of Spezia on the west, 7 m. S. of Spezia by road. Pop. 
(1901), 1553 (town); 5754 (commune). The fortress and walls 
with which it was provided by the Genoese in the 9th or 10th 
century have been destroyed for military reasons. The restored 
church of St Peter, of black and w T hite marble (n 18; destroyed 
by the Aragonese in 1494), is reputed to occupy the site of a 
temple of Venus. The parish church dates from 1098. Yellow- 
veined black marble, known as Portoro, and building-stone are 
quarried here and in the fortified island of Palmaria to the 
east of Portovenere. In the Grotta dei Colombi objects of the 
Palaeolithic age have been found. 

PORT PHILLIP, the harbour of Melbourne, Victoria, Aus- 
tralia. An almost circular, landlocked sheet of water, it is 31 m. 
long* 20 m. at its widest, with an area of 800 sq. m. A narrow 
channel flanked by bold cliffs forms its entrance, and when the 
tide recedes through it a strong current is encountered outside. 
The broken and somewhat dangerous sea thus caused is called 
" the Rip. " Within the port on the eastern side are suburbs 
of Melbourne, such as Sorrento, Mornington, Frankston, Carrum, 
Mordialloc, RedclifT, Brighton and St Kilda. The wharves 
of Port Melbourne and Williamstown stand at the head of the 
port on an arm known as Hobson's Bay. On the western side 
the port of Geelong and the port and watering-place of Queens- 
cliff are the only towns of importance. Port Phillip is well 
fortified with strong batteries at its entrance. The harbour 
was discovered in 1802 by Lieut. Murray, who named it in 
honour of Captain Phillip, first governor of New South Wales. 
The colony of Victoria was originally called the district of Port 
Phillip.

Pop. (iqoi), 7983. 

PORTRAITURE. The earliest attempts at individual por- 
traiture (see also Painting) are found in the eidolon and 
mummy-cases of the ancient Egyptians; but their painting 
never went beyond conventional representation — mere outlines 
filled in with a flat tint of colour. In Greece portraiture probably 
had its origin in skiagraphy or shadow-painting. The story of 
the Greek maiden tracing the shadow of her departing lover 
on the wall points to this. The art developed rapidly. In 
463 B.C., Polygnotus, one of the first Greek painters of- distinc- 
tion, introduced individual portraiture in the decoration of public 
buildings, and Apelles nearly a century later showed so much 
genius in rendering character and expression, that Alexander 
the Great appointed, him "portrait painter in ordinary," and 
issued an edict forbidding any one else to produce pictorial 
representations of his majesty. Similar edicts were issued in 
favour of the sculptor Lysippus and Pyrgoteles the gem en- 
graver. No works of the Greek painters survive, but the 
fate of two portraits by Apelles, which were in the possession 
of the emperor Claudius (a.d. 41-54), is known, the heads 
having been painted out to make room for the features of the 
divine Augustus! 

After the time of Alexander (300 B.C.) Greek art rapidly 
deteriorated. There is, perhaps, nothing in the history of human 
intelligence to compare with the dazzling swiftness of its 
development or the rapidity of its decline. War was followed 
by pillage and devastation, and victorious Roman generals, 
mere depredators and plunderers, crowded Rome with the 
stolen treasures of Greece, with the result that Greek art and 
Greek influence soon made themselves felt in the imperial city, 
and for generations its artists were almost exclusively Greeks, 
chiefly portrait painters and decorators. The Romans pos- 
sessed no innate aptitude for art, and rather despised it as a 
pursuit little becoming the dignity of a citizen. Although lack- 
ing in appreciation of the higher conditions of art, they had 
from early times decorated their atria with effigies — originally 
wax moulds — of the countenances of their ancestors. These 
primitive " wax-works " ultimately developed into portrait 
busts, often vivid and faithful, the only branch of art in which 
Rome achieved excellence. 

. With the invasion of the Northern barbarians and the fall 
of the empire Graeco-Roman art ended. In the following 
centuries Christianity gradually became the dominant religion, 
hut its ascetic temper could not find expression in the old artistic 
forms. Instead of joy in the ideals of bodily perfection, came a 
loathing of the body and its heauty, and artists were classed 
among " persons of iniquitous occupations. " Before the 5th 
century these prejudices had relaxed, and images and pictures 
again came into general favour for religious uses. In the 8th 
and 9th centuries, the iconoclasts commenced their systematic 
destruction, and it was not till the Renaissance in the 13th 
century that art began again to live. The great revival brought 
with it a closer observation of the facts of nature and a growing 
sense of beauty, and the works of Cimabue and Giotto prepared 
the way for those of Benozzo Gozzoli, Ghirlandaio and the 
long line of masters who raised Italian art to such a height in 
the 15th and 16th centuries. Although the works of the early 
painters of the Renaissance were mostly devoted to the expres- 
sion of the dogmas of the Church, the growing love and study of 
nature led them, as opportunity afforded, to introduce portraits 
of living contemporaries into their sacred pictures. Gozzoli 
( 1 420-1 498) and Ghirlandaio (1 440-1 494) began the practice, 
followed by nearly all the old and great painters, of introducing 
portraiture into their works; Ghirlandaio especially filling some 
of his great fresco compositions with the forms and features of 
the living men and women of Florence, members of the Torna- 
huoni, Medici and other great families. Acuteness of observa- 
tion was innate in the race. By degrees it manifested itself 
in a marvellous subtlety in the rendering of individual character, 
in the portrayal of individual men and women, and a school of

portraiture was developed of which Titian hecame the crowning 
glory. This great Venetian painter, by universal consent 
reckoned one of the masters of portraiture, has handed down to 
us the features of many of the greatest historical and literary 
personages of- his time — emperor, pope, king, doge — all sat 
by turn to him and loaded him with honours. The names of 
Bellini, Raffaelle, Tintoret, Veronese and Moroni of Bergamo 
occur among those of the great Italian portrait painters of the 
15th and 1 6th centuries. The last-named, some of whose finest 
works are now in England, was highly praised hy Titian. 

A love of ugliness characterizes the artists of the early Germ 
and Flemish schools, and most of the portraits produced 
them previous to Holbein's time suffer from this cause. Scho 
gauer, Diirer and Lucas Cranach are never agreeable or pleasai 
however interesting in other respects. Diirer, the typL 
German artist, the dreamer of dreams, the theorist, the thinker, 
the writer, was less fitted by nature for a portrait painter than 
Holbein, who, with a keen sense of nature's subtle beauty, was 
a far greater painter although a less powerful personality. He 
produced many fine works in other branches, but it is as a 
portrait painter that Holbein is chiefly known, and his highest 
claims to fame will rest on his marvellous achievements in that 
branch of art. He first came to England in 1526, bringing with 
him letters of introduction from Erasmus. Sir Thomas More 
received him as his guest, and during his stay he painted More's 
and Archbishop Warham's portraits. In 1532 he was again 
in London, where till his death in 1543 he spent much of his 
time. He was largely employed by the German merchants 
of the Steelyard and many Englishmen of note, and afterwards 
by Henry VIII., by whom he was taken into permanent service 
with a pension. As a portrait painter Holbein is remarkable not 
only for his keen insight into the character of his sitters, but for 
the beauty and delicacy of his drawing. As colourist he may be 
judged by an admirable example of his work, " The Ambas- 
sadors," in the National Gallery in London. Many of his 
drawings appear to have been made as preliminary studies for 
his portraits. 

In Flanders Jan van Eyck (1390-1440), his brother Hubert, 
Quintin Matsys, Memlinc and other artists of the 15th century 
occasionally practised portraiture. The picture of Jean Arnol- 
fini and his wife, in the National Gallery, London, is a remarkable 
sample of the first-named artist, and the small half-length of 
young Martin van Nieumenhoven, in the hospital of St John 
at Bruges, of the last-named. Nearly a century later the names 
of Antony Mor (or Moro) , Rubens and Van Dyck appear. Rubens, 
although not primarily a painter of portraits, achieved no small 
distinction in that way, being much employed by royalty 
(Maria de Medici, Philip IV. and the English Charles I. among 
the number). His services were also in request as ambassador 
or diplomatist, and thrice at least he was sent on missions 
of that nature. His personal energy and industry were enor- 
mous, but a large proportion of the work attributed to him was 
painted by pupils, of whom Van Dyck was one of the most 
celebrated. Van Dyck (1590-1641) early acquired a high repu- 
tation as a portrait painter. In 1632 he was invited to England 
by Charles I., and settled there for the remainder of his life. 
He was knighted by Charles, and granted a pension of £200 a 
year, with the title of painter to his majesty. Many of Van 
Dyck's portraits, especially those of the early and middle 
periods, are unsurpassed in their freshness, force and vigour of 
handling. He is a master among masters. England possesses 
many of his works, especially of his later period. To Van 
Dyck we owe much of our knowledge of what Charles I. and 
those about him were like. A routine practice, luxurious 
living, failing health, and the employment of assistants told 
upon his work, which latterly lost much of its early charm. 

In Holland in the 17th century portraiture reached a high 
standard. A reaction had set in against Italian influence, and 
extreme faithfulness and literal resemblance became the pre- 
vailing fashion. The large portrait pictures of the members of 
gilds and corporations, so frequently met with in Holland, are 
characteristically Dutch. The earliest works of the kind are 



PORTRAITURE 



129 



generally rows of portraits ranged in double or single lines, 
without much attempt at grouping or composition. Later, 
in the hands of painters like Rembrandt, Frans Hals and Van 
der Heist, these pictures of civic guards, hospital regents and 
masters of gilds assumed a very different character, and are 
among the very finest works produced by the Dutch portrait 
painters of the 17th century. They may be termed " subscrip- 
tion portraits " — each member of the gild who desired a place 
on the canvas agreeing, before the commission was given, to 
pay, according to a graduated scale, his share of the cost. 
Among the most famous examples of this class of portraits 
are " The Anatomy Lesson, " " The March-out of Captain 
Banning Kock and his Company " (erroneously called " The 
Night Watch "), and " The Five Syndics of the Cloth-Workers' 
Guild, " by Rembrandt. The magnificent portrait groups at 
Haarlem by Hals — the next greatest portrait painter of Holland 
after Rembrandt — and the " Schuttersmaaltyd " by Van der 
Heist in the Amsterdam Museum, which Reynolds considered 
" perhaps the first picture of portraits in the world, " must also 
be mentioned. 

Of the pictorial art of Spain previous to the 15th century, 
little, if any, survives. Flemish example was long paramount 
and Flemish painters were patronized in high places. In the 
16th century the names of native Spanish artists began to 
appear — Morales, Ribera, Zurbaran, a great though not a pro- 
fessed portrait painter; and in the last year of the century 
Velasquez was born, the greatest of Spain's artists, and one of 
the great portrait painters of the world. None, perhaps, 
has ever equalled him in keen insight into character, or in the 
swift magic of his brush. Philip IV., Olivarez and Innocent X. 
live for us on his canvases. His constantly varying, though 
generally extremely simple, methods, explain to some extent 
the interest and charm his works possess for artists. Depth 
of feeling and poetic imagination were, however, lacking, as 
may be seen in his prosaic treatment of such subjects as the 
" Coronation of the Virgin," the " Mars " and other kindred 
works in the Madrid Gallery. Velasquez must be classed with 
those whose career has been prematurely cut short. His works 
often show signs of haste and of the scanty leisure which the 
duties of his office of " Aposentador Mayor " left him — duties 
which ended in the fatal journey to the Isle of Rhe. 

In France the most distinguished portrait painters of the 16th 
and 17th centuries were the Clouets, Cousin, Vouet, Philippe 
de Champaigne, Rigaud and Vanloo. French portraiture, 
long inflated and artificial, reached the height of pomposity 
in the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV., the epoch of which the 
towering wig is the symbol. In the i8tb and early part of the 
19th centuries occur the names of Boucher, Greuze, David, 
Gerard and Ingres; but somehow the portraits of the French 
masters seldom attract and captivate in the same way as those 
of the Dutch and Italian painters. 

Foreign artists were engaged for almost every important 
work in painting in England down to the days of Sir Joshua 
Reynolds and Gainsborough. Henry VIII. employed Holbein; 
Queen Mary, Sir Antonio Moro; Elizabeth, Zucchero and Lucas 
de Hecre; James I. van Somer, Cornelius Janssens and Daniel 
Mytens; Charles I. Rubens, Van Dyck, Mytens, Petitot, Hon- 
thorst and others; and Charles II., Lely and Kneller, although 
there were native artists of merit, among them Dobson, Walker 
and Jamesone, a Scottish painter. Puritan England and Presby- 
terian Scotland did little to encourage the portrait painter. 
The attitude of the latter towards it may be inferred from an 
entry in the diary of Sir Thomas Hope, the Scottish Lord Advo- 
cate in 1638. " This day, Friday, William Jamesone, painter 
(at the earnest desyr of my sone Mr Alexander) was sufferit to 
draw my pictur." He does not even give the painter's name 
correctly, although Jamesone at the time was a man of some 
note in Scotland. At the commencement *of the reign of 
George I. art in England had sunk to about the lowest ebb. 
With the appearance of William Hogarth (1697-1764) the English 
school of painting may be said to have commenced, and in 
Reynolds and Gainsborough it produced two portrait painters 
xxn. 5 



whose works hold their own with those of the masters of the 
1 6th and 17th centuries. Both Sir Joshua and Gainsborough 
are seen at their best in portraits of women and children. 

George Romncy (1734-1802) shared with Reynolds and 
Gainsborough the patronage of the wealthy and fashionable 
of his day. Many of his female portraits arc of great beauty. 
For some unknown reason he never exhibited his works in the 
Royal Academy. 

Sir Henry Raeburn (1 756-1823) was a native of Edinburgh, 
and spent most of his life there. His portraits are broad and 
effective in treatment, masterly and swift in execution and often 
fine in colour. He painted nearly all the distinguished Scotsmen 
of his time — Walter Scott, Adam Smith, Braxfield, Robertson 
the historian, Dugald Stewart, Boswell, Jeffrey, Professor 
Wilson and many of the leading noblemen, lairds, clergy and 
their wives and daughters. For a considerable period his 
portraits were little known out of Scotland, but they are now 
much sought after, and fine examples appearing in London 
sale-rooms bring remarkable prices. Raeburn's immediate 
successor in Scotland, J. Watson Gordon (1788-1864), also 
painted many excellent portraits, chiefly of men. A very 
characteristic example of his art at its best may be seen in his 
" Provost of Peterhead " in the Scottish National Gallery. 

Sir Thomas Lawrence (1 760-1830) was the favourite English 
portrait painter of his time, and had an almost unrivalled career. 
He had an immense practice, and between the years 1787 and 
1830 exhibited upwards of three hundred portraits in the Royal 
Academy alone. The Waterloo Gallery at Windsor contains 
some of his best work, chiefly painted in 1818-1819, including his 
portraits of the emperor Francis, Pope Pius VII. and Cardinal 
Gonsalvi. He was loaded -with honours, and died President 
of the Royal Academy. 

Sir J. E. Millais (1 820-1 896), although most widely known as 
a painter of figure subjects, achieved some of his greatest suc- 
cesses in portraiture, and no artist in recent years has approached 
him as a painter of children. His portraits of Gladstone, 
Sir James Paget, Sir Gilbert Greenall, Simon Fraser, J. C. Hook 
and Mrs. Bischoffsheim, to name only a few, are alone sufficient 
to give him a high place among British portrait painters. 

Frank Holl (184 5-1 888) first came into note as a portrait 
painter in 1878, and during the subsequent nine years of his 
life he painted upwards of one hundred and ninety-eight portraits, 
an average of over twenty-two a year. The strain, however, 
proved too great for a naturally delicate constitution, and he 
died at the age of forty-three — another instance of a brilliant 
career prematurely cut short. To G. F. Watts (1820-1904) we 
are indebted for admirable portraits of many of the leading 
men of the Victorian era in politics, science, literature, theology 
and art. Among more recent artists, Sir W. Q. Orchardson 
(183 5-1 910), like Millais more widely known as a painter of 
figure subjects, but also admirable as a portrait painter; John 
Sargent (1856- ), whose brilliant and vigorous characteri- 
zation of his sitters leaves him without a rival; as well as 
Ouless, Shannon, Fildes, Hcrkomer and others, have worthily 
carried on the best traditions of the art. 

In France contemporary portraiture is ably represented in the 
works of Carolus-Duran, Bonnat and Benjamin Constant, 
and in Germany by Lenbach, who has handed down to posterity 
with uncompromising faithfulness the form and features of 
Prince Bismarck. 

Of portraiture in its other developments little need be said. 
Miniature painting, which grew out of the work of the illumina- 
tor, appears to have been always successfully practised in 
England. The works of Hilliard, Isaac and Peter Oliver, 
Samuel Cooper, Hoskins, Englehcart, Plimer and Cosway hold 
their own with the best of the kind; but this beautiful art, 
like that of the engraver, has been largely superseded by photo- 
graphy and the " processes " now in use. 

It is unnecessary to refer to the many uses of portraiture, 
but one of its chiefest has been to transmit to posterity the 
form and features of those who have played a part, worthy or 
otherwise, in the past history of our race. Of its value to the

PORT RICHMOND— PORT ROYAL 



biographer and historian, Carlyle, in a letter written in 1854, 
says, "In all my poor historical investigations it is one of the 
most primary wants to procure a bodily likeness of the personage 
inquired after; a good portrait, if such exists; failing that, 
even an indifferent, if sincere one; in short, any representation, 
made by a faithful human creature, of that face and figure 
which he saw with his eyes and which I can never see with mine. 
Often I have found the portrait superior in real instruction to 
half-a-dozen written biographies, or rather, I have found the 
portrait was as a small lighted candle, by which the biographies 
could for the first time be read, and some human interpretation 
be made of them." (G. Re.) 

PORT RICHMOND, a part of the borough of Richmond in the 
city of New York, U.S.A., on the N. shore of Staten Island and 
on the Kill van Kull Channel. Before 1898 it was a separate 
village of Richmond county, New York, containing 6290 
inhabitants in 1890. It is served by the Staten Island Rapid 
Transit railway, and by a ferry to Bergen Point, New Jersey, 
and has steam and electric railway connexions with the municipal 
ferry at St George, which furnishes easy access to the business 
districts on Manhattan Island. Among its places of historic 
interest are the Dutch Reformed Church, which is the direct 
successor of the church established on Staten Island in 1664 
or 1665 by Waldenses and Huguenots; and the Danner Hotel, 
built soon after the War of Independence on the site of a tem- 
porary fort that had been erected by British troops, and used as 
a private dwelling until 1820. In this house Aaron Burr spent 
the last years of his life, dying there on the 14th of September 
1836. Among the industrial establishments are a shipyard, 
dry dock and manufactories of flour, lumber, lead paint and 
builders' supplies. On the first of January 1898, when the act 
creating Greater New York came into effect, the village became 
a part of the third ward of Richmond borough. 

PORT ROYAL, a celebrated Cistercian abbey, occupied a low 
and marshy site in the thickly wooded valley of the Yvette, at 
what is now known as Les Hameaux near Marly, a few miles 
south-west of Paris. It was founded in 1204 by Mahaut de 
Garlande, wife of Mathieu de Montmorenci-Marli in 1204; the 
church was built in 1229 from the designs of Robert de Luzarches. 
During its early years the convent received a number of papal 
privileges; the most important of these, granted by Honorius 
III. in 1223, authorized it to offer a retreat to women anxious 
to withdraw from the world without binding themselves by 
perpetual vows. Little is known of its history during the three 
succeeding centuries, except that its discipline became relaxed; 
reform was only attempted when Angelique Arnauld (q.v.) 
was appointed coadjutor to the elderly and invalid abbess in 
1598. Angelique's reforming energy soon brought her into 
contact with Jean Duvergier (q.v.) abbot of Saint Cyran, and 
chief apostle in France of the Jansenist revival, and the later 
history of her convent is indissolubly connected with this 
movement. 

In 1626 constant visitations of ague drove the nuns to Paris; 
they settled at Port Royal de Paris, at the end of the Faubourg 
Saint Jacques. The deserted buildings of Port Royal des Champs 
were presently occupied by " hermits," laymen, mostly relatives 
of the abbess, who wished for a semi-monastic existence, though 
without taking formal vows. In 1648, however, some of the nuns 
returned to the country, and the hermits retreated to buildings at 
a short distance, from the abbey. Here they set up a "little 
school " for the sons of Jansenist parents; and here Jean Racine, 
the future poet, received his education. But in 1653 Innocent X. 
condemned the doctrines of Jansen. Three years later " the 
hermitage " and school were broken up, and the nuns were for- 
bidden to receive new members into their community. These 
rigours were much increased when Louis XIV. took up the reins 
of government in 1660; between 1664 and 1669 the archbishop of 
Paris laid under an interdict those of the nuns who refused to 
subscribe the papal censure on Jansen. In 1669, however, came 
the so-called " Peace of Clement IX., M when the Jansenists gener- 
ally were admitted to grace, and the interdict was removed from 
Port Royal, though the authorities broke up the convent into two 
distinct communities. The conformist nuns were gathered to- 
gether at Port Royal de Paris, under an independent abbess; their 
Jansenist sisters were united at the original building in the country. 
Thereupon followed ten years of peace, for the nuns had a powerful 
protector in the king's cousin, Mme de Longueville. But in 



1679 she died, and Louis at once ordered the nuns to send awa 
their novices and boarders and to receive no others. Finally, 
in 1705, he got from Clement XI. a new condemnation of the 
Jansenists, which the few remaining nuns, all of whom were over 
sixty, refused to sign; and on the 29th of October 1709 they 
were forcibly removed from Port Royal by the police, and dis- 
tributed among various conformist convents. In the following 
spring the buildings were pulled down; even the cemetery was 
not spared. The land on which the convent had stood was made 
over to Mme de Maintenon's college of St Cyr; in 1825 it was 
bought by some descendants of Jansenist families, who have done 
their best to restore the grounds to their original appearance, and 
have built a museum rich in Jansenist relics. Port Royal de Paris 
was secularized at the French Revolution, and is now a maternity 
hospital.

PORT ROYAL, an island in Beaufort county, South Carolina, 
U.S.A., at the head of Port Royal Sound, about 16 m. from the 
Atlantic coast, and about 50 m. S.W. of Charleston. It is about 
13 m. long (north and south) by about 7 m. wide. The surface 
is generally flat, and there is much marshland in its southern 
part, and along its north-eastern shore. The principal settle- 
ment is Beaufort, a port of entry, and the county-seat of Beaufort 
county, on the Beaufort river (here navigable for vessels drawing 
18 ft.), about n m. from its mouth, and about 15 m. from the 
ocean. Pop. (1900) 41 10 (3220 negroes); (19 10) 2486; It is 
served by the Charleston & Western Carolina railway, has inland 
water communication with Savannah, Georgia, and its harbour, 
Port Royal Sound (between Bay Point on the north-east and 
Hilton Head on the south-west), is one of the largest and 
best on the coast of South Carolina. Beaufort's beautiful 
situation and delightful climate make it a winter resort. 
In the vicinity Sea Island cotton, rice, potatoes and other 
vegetables are raised — the truck industry having become 
very important; and there are groves of yellow pine and 
cypress. Large quantities of phosphate rock were formerly 
shipped from here. Among the manufactures are cotton goods, 
canned oysters, lumber and fertilizer. About 5 m. south of Beau- 
fort is the town of Port Royal (pop. in 1 910, 363), a terminus 
of the Charleston & Western Carolina railway. On the Beau- 
. fort River (eastern) shore of Paris Island, about 6 m. north of 
Bay Point, is a United States naval station, with a dry dock and 
repair shop. 

Jean Ribaut (1520-1565), leading an expedition sent out 
by Admiral Gaspard de Coligny (15 17-1572) to found a Huguenot 
colony in New France, sailed into the harbour, which he named 
Port Royal, on the 27th of May 1562, took possession of the 
region in the name of Charles IX., and established the first 
settlement (Fort Charles), probably on Paris Island. In June he 
sailed for France, leaving 26 volunteers under Captain Albert de 
la Pierria. Soon afterward the garrison killed Pierria (probably 
because of the severity of his discipline), and put to sea in an 
insufficiently equipped vessel, from which, after much suffering, 
they were rescued by an English ship, and taken to England. In 
1670, a company under Colonel William Sayle (d. 167 1) landed 
on Port Royal Island, but probably because this site exposed 
them to Spanish attacks, proceeded along the coast and founded 
the original Charles Town (see Charleston). In 1683, several 
families, chiefly Scotch, led by Henry Erskine, third Lord Card- 
ross (1 650-1 693), established on the island a settlement named 
Stuart's Town (probably in honour of Cardross's family); but 
three years later most of the settlers were murdered by Spaniards 
from Florida and the remainder fled to Charleston. In 1710, 
after the lords proprietors had issued directions for " the 
building of a town to be called Beaufort Town," in honour 
of Henry Somerset, duke of Beaufoifc (1629-1700), the first 
permanent settlement was established on the island. The 
town was incorporated in 1803. In January 1779 about 200 
British soldiers occupied the island by order of Colonel Augus- 
tine Prevost, but they were dislodged (Feb. 3) by about 300 



PORTRUSH— PORTSMOUTH, DUCHESS OF 



Americans, mostly militiamen, under General William Moultrie. 
At the beginning of the Civil War the Confederates erected Fort 
Walker on Hilton Head, and Fort Beauregard on Bay Point. 
Captain (afterwards Admiral) Samuel F. Du Pont and General 
Thomas W. Sherman organized an expedition against these 
fortifications, which were reduced by a naval bombardment 
and were evacuated by the Confederates under General Thomas 
F. Drayton (d. 1891) on the 7th of November 1861. During 
the remainder of the war Port Royal Harbour was used as a 
coaling, repair and supply station by the Federal blockading 
squadron. Early in 1862 Port Royal Island and the neigh- 
bouring region became the scene of the so-called " Port Royal 
Experiment " — the successful effort of a group of northern 
people, chiefly from Boston, New York and Philadelphia, among 
whom Edward S. Philbrick (d. 1889) of Massachusetts was 
conspicuous, to take charge of the cotton plantations, deserted 
upon the occupation of the island by Union troops, and to employ 
the negroes under a system of paid labour. The volunteers 
organized as the Educational Commission for Freed men (after- 
ward the New England Freedmen's Aid Society), and the 
government granted them transportation, subsistence and 
quarters, and paid them small salaries.

1897-1901); and, for an account of the Port Royal Experiment,

Pearson. 

PORTRUSH, a seaport and the most popular seaside resort 
of Co. Antrim, Ireland; the terminus of a branch of the 
Northern Counties (Midland) railway. Pop. (1901), 1941. It 
is very picturesquely situated on the basaltic peninsula of 
Ramore Head, with a deep bay on either side, and a harbour 
protected by the natural breakwater known as the Skerries. 
A fine hotel, owned by the railway company, and an excellent 
golf course are the chief features, together with a town-ball 
with public reading room/ and the place is much frequented for 
golf and sea-bathing. It is also the centre for visitors to the 
Giants' Causeway, with which it is connected by an electric 
railway. Dunluce Castle, between Portrush and Bushmills, 
stands on a rock separated from the mainland by a chasm which 
is spanned by a bridge. The ruins, which are extensive, are of 
unknown date. Portrush has a thriving trade in salmon. It 
is governed by an urban district council. 

PORT SAID, a seaport of Egypt, at the northern entrance of 
the Suez Canal, in 31 15' 35* N., 32 19' 20* E., and 145 m. by 
rail N.E. of Cairo. Pop. (1907), 49,884. It lies on the western 
side of the canal on the low, narrow, treeless and desolate strip 
of land which separates the Mediterranean from Lake Menzala, 
the land at this point being raised and its area increased by the 
draining of part of the lake and by the excavation of the inner 
harbour. The outer harbour is formed by two breakwaters 
which protect the entrance to the canal; altogether the harbour 
covers about 570 acres and accommodates ships drawing 28 ft. 
Originally besides the central basin of the inner harbour there 
were three docks; between 1903 and 1909 the harbour accommo- 
dation was doubled by the construction of new docks on the 
eastern side of the canal and by enlarging the western docks. 
The port possesses a floating dock 295 ft. long, 85 ft. broad and 
18 ft. deep, capable of lifting 3500 tons, and a patent slip taking 
300 tons and ships drawing 9 ft. 9 in. of water. On the western 
breakwater is a colossal statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps by E. 
Frcmict, unveiled in 1899, and a lighthouse 174 ft. high. Among 
the few buildings of note in the town are the offices of the Suez 
Canal Company and the British barracks, the last named having 
been built by Prince Henry of the Netherlands (d. 1879) as a 
dep6t for Dutch trade. 

Port Said dates from 1859 and its situation was determined by 
the desire of the engineers of the Suez Canal to start the canal at 
the point on the Mediterranean coast of the isthmus of Suez nearest 
to deep water, and off the spot where Port Said now stands there 
was found a depth of 26 ft. at about 2 m. from the shore. For 
many years after its foundation it depended entirely upon the 
traffic of the canal, being the chief coaling station of all ships 
passing through and becoming the largest coaling station in the 



J 3i 

world. The population was of a very heterogeneous character, but 
mainly of an undesirable class of Levantines; this with the damp 
heat and the dirt and noise of the incessant coaling operations 
gave the town an unenviable reputation. In 1902, however, a 
new industry was added in the export of cotton from the eastern 
provinces of the Delta, the cotton being brought from Mataria by 
boat across Lake Menzala. In 1904 the opening of a standard 
gauge railway to Cairo placed Port Said in a position to compete 
with Alexandria for the external trade of Egypt generally, besides 
making it a tourist route to the capital from Europe. The result 
was to attract to the town a considerable commercial community 
and to raise its social status. A new suburb was created by re- 
claiming land on the north foreshore, and another suburb was 
created on the eastern side of the canal. The average annual 
value of the trade of the port for the five years 1902-1906 was 
£2,410,000. This figure includes the value of the coal used by 
vessels passing through the Suez Canal. 

PORTSMOUTH, EARLS OF. In 1743 John Wallop (1600- 
1762) of Farley Wallop in Hampshire was created earl of 
Portsmouth. He belonged to an old Hampshire family and 
had been a lord of the treasury from 171 7 to 1720, when he was 
created Baron Wallop. The earldom has since been held by 
his descendants, one of whom, Newton Wallop (b. 1856), 
became the 6th earl in 1891. This earl was a member of 
parliament from 1880 to 1891 and was under secretary of state 
for war from 1905 to 1908. 

PORTSMOUTH, LOUISE DE K^ROUALLE, Duchess of 
(1649-1734), mistress of the English king Charles II., was the 
daughter of Guillaume de Penancourt and his wife Marie de 
Plaeuc de Timeur. The name of Keroualle was derived from an 
heiress whom her ancestor Francois de Penhoet had married in 
1330. The family were nobles in Brittany, and their name was 
so spelt by themselves. But the form Querouailles was com- 
monly used in England, where it was corrupted into Car well or 
Carewell, perhaps with an ironic reference to the care which the 
duchess took to fill her pocket. In France it was variously 
spelt Queroul, Keroual and Keroel. The exact date of her birth 
is apparently unknown. Louise was placed early in life in the 
household of Henriette, duchess of Orleans, sister of Charles II. 
Saint-Simon asserts that her family threw her in the way of 
Louis XIV. in the hope that she would be promoted to the place 
of royal mistress. In 1670 she accompanied the duchess of 
Orleans on a visit to Charles II. at Dover. The sudden death 
of the duchess, attributed on dubious evidence to poison, left 
her unprovided for, but the king placed her among the ladies in 
waiting of his own queen. It was said in after times that she 
had been selected by the French court to fascinate the king of 
England, but for this there seems to be no evidence. Yet when 
there appeared a prospect that the king would show her favour, 
the intrigue was vigorously pushed by the French ambassador, 
Colbert de Croissy, aided by the secretary of state, Lord Arling- 
ton, and his wife. Louise, who concealed great cleverness and 
a strong will under an appearance of languor and a rather 
childish beauty (Evelyn the diarist speaks of her " baby face ")> 
yielded only when she had already established a strong hold on 
the king's affections and character. Her son, ancestor of the 
dukes of Richmond, was born in 1672. 

The support she received from the French envoy was given on 
the understanding that she should serve the interests of her native 
sovereign. The bargain was confirmed by gifts and honours 
from Louis XIV. and was loyally carried out by Louise- The 
hatred openly avowed for her in England was due as much to her 
own activity in the interest of France as to her notorious rapacity. 
The titles of Baroness Petersfield, countess of Fareham and duchess 
of Portsmouth were granted her for life on the 19th of August 
1673. Her pensions and money allowances of various lands were 
enormous. In 1677 alone she received £27,300. The French 
court gave her frequent presents, and in December 1673 conferred 
upon her the ducal fief of Aubigny at the request of Charles II. 
Her thorough understanding of the king's character enabled her 
to retain her hold on him to the end. She contrived to escape 
uninjured during the crisis of the Popish Plot in 1678. She was 
strong enough to maintain her position during a long illness in 
1677, and a visit to France in 1682. In February 1685 she took 
measures to see that the king, who was secretly a Roman Catholic, 
did not die without confession and absolution. Soon after the king's 
death she retired to France, where, except for one short visit 
to England during the reign of James II., she remained. Her pen- 
sions and an outrageous grant on the Irish revenue given her by

Charles II. were lost either in the reign of Tames II. or at the Revolu- 
tion of 1688. During her last years she lived at Aubigny, and was 
harassed by debt. The French king, Louis XIV., and after his 
death the regent Orleans, gave her a pension, and protected her 
against her creditors. She died at Paris on the 14th of November 

1734.

PORTSMOUTH, a municipal, county and parliamentary 
borough, and seaport of Hampshire, England, 74 m. S.W. from 
London, on the London & South-Western and the London, 
Brighton & South Coast railways. Pop. (1891), 159,278; 
(1901), 188,133. This great naval station and arsenal is an

aggregate of four towns, Portsmouth, Portsea, Landport and 
Southsea, and occupies the south-western part of Portsea 
Island, which lies between Portsmouth Harbour and Langstone 
Harbour, two inlets of the English Channel. Portsmouth 
Harbour opens into Spithead, one of the arms of the Channel 
separating the Isle of Wight from the mainland. The harbour 
widens inwards in bottle form, Portsmouth lying on the east 
shore of the neck, with Gosport opposite to it on the west side. 
Portsmouth proper may be distinguished as the garrison town; 
Portsea as the naval station with the dockyards; Landport is 
occupied chiefly by the houses of artisans; and Southsea is a 
residential quarter and a favourite watering-place. Besides a 
number of handsome modern churches, among which is a Roman 
Catholic cathedral, Portsmouth possesses, in the church of St 
Thomas a Becket, a fine cruciform building dating from the 
second half of the 12th century, in which the chancel and 
transepts are original, but the nave and tower date from 1698, 
and the whole was extensively restored in 1904. The garrison 
chapel originally belonged to. the hospital of St Nicholas, a 
foundation of the 13th century. Among other buildings worthy 
of mention (apart from those having naval or military connexion) 
the principal is the town-hall (1890), a fine classic building 
standing alone in a square, and surmounted by a handsome 
clock tower. Among educational institutions there are a large 
grammar school (1879), on a foundation of 1732, Roman Catholic 
schools adjoining the cathedral, schools for engineering students 
and dockyard apprentices, and seamen and marines' orphan 
school. Aria College in Portsea was opened in 1874 for the 
training of Jewish ministers. Victoria Park, in the heart of the 
town, contains a monument to Admiral Napier. There are 
recreation grounds for the naval and military forces in the 
vicinity. There is a railway station (Portsmouth Harbour) on 
the Hard, from which passenger steamers serve Ryde in the 
Isle of Wight. A ferry and a floating bridge connect with 
Gosport. The port has a considerable trade in coal, timber, 
fruits and agricultural produce. The parliamentary borough 
returns two members. The county borough was created in 
1888. The municipal borough is under a mayor, 14 aldermen 
and 42 councillors. Area, 5010 acres. 



The dockyard seems to have been regularly established about 
1540, but long before that date the town was of importance as 
a naval station and was used for the accommodation of the king's 
ships. In 1540 it covered 8 acres of ground, abutting on the harbour 
near the " King's Stairs." Cromwell added 2 acres in 1658, and 
Charles II. added 8 in 1663 and 10 more in 1667. By 17 10 30 acres 
more had been reclaimed or bought, and by the end of the 18th 
century the total area was 90 acres. In 1848 a steam basin, cover- 
ing 7 acres, and four new docks were opened, the dockyard ground 
being extended to 115 acres in all. In 1865 large extension works 
were decided upon, increasing the area to 293 acres. These included 
a tidal basin and, opening out of it, a deep dock and two locks, 
in themselves serving as large docks, which lead to three basins 
and four_ docks. An entrance was also formed between the new 
tidal basin and the steam basin of 1848, and large additions were 
made to the wharfage accommodation as well as to the 
storehouses and factories. Subsequent improvements 
included the formation of two new dry docks (1896) 
with a floor-length of 557 ft. and a depth of 33^ ft. over 
the sill at high water of spring tides; the construction 
of new jetties at the entrance to the tidal basin and at 
the north wall; the establishment of a coal wharf with 
hydraulic appliances; a torpedo range in the harbour; 
the erection of various buildings such as torpedo and 
gun-mounting stores, electrical shops and numerous 
subsidiary works; and extensive dredging of the harbour 
to increase the berthing accommodation for the fleet. 
Altogether the dockyard comprises 15 dry docks, 60 
acres of enclosed _ basins, 18,400 ft. of wharfage and 
about 10 m. of railway. There is a gunnery establish- 
ment in the harbour on Whale Island, the area of which 
has been increased to nearly 90 acres by the accretion 
of material excavated from the dockyard extension 
works, and various barracks including those of the 
royal marine artillery at Eastney, beyond Southsea. 

Portsmouth (Portstnue t Portestnuth) owes its origin 
to the retreat of the sea from Porchester, and its 
importance to its favourable position for a naval 
station. Though probably the site had long been 
merywaikersc recognized as a convenient landing-place, no town 
existed there until the 1 2th century, when the strategical advan- 
tage it offered induced Richard I. to build one. He granted 
a charter in 1194 declaring that he retained the borough in his 
hand, and granting a yearly fair and weekly market, freedom 
from certain tolls, from shire and hundred court and sheriffs* 
aids. In October 1200 King John repeated the grants, and 
Henry III. in 1229 gave the " men of Portsmouth " the town 
in fee farm and granted a merchant gild. Confirmations were 
made by successive kings, and a charter of incorporation was 
given by Elizabeth in 1 590-1600. A new and enlarged charter 
was granted by Charles I. in 1627, by which the borough is now 
governed subject to changes by the municipal acts of the 19th 
century. Portsmouth has returned two members to parliament 
since 1295. A fair on the 1st of August and fourteen following 
days was granted by Richard I. The first day was afterwards 
changed to the 29th of June and later to the nth of July. It 
was important as a trading fair for cutlery, earthenware, cloth 
and Dutch metal, and was abolished in 1846. The market, 
dating from 1194 and originally held on Thursday only, is now 
held on Tuesday and Saturday in addition. Portsmouth was 
important in the middle ages not only as a naval station but a 
trading centre. There was a considerable trade in wool and 
wine, and the building of the dockyards by Henry VII. further 
increased its prosperity.

PORTSMOUTH, a city, port of entry and one of the county- 
seats of Rockingham county, New Hampshire, U.S.A., on the 
Piscataqua river, about 3 m. from the Atlantic Ocean, about 
45 m. E.S.E. of Concord, and about 54 fn. N.N.E. of Boston. 
Pop. (19 10 U.S. census) 11,269. Area, 17 sq. m. Portsmouth is 
served by the Boston & Maine railway, by electric lines to 
neighbouring towns, and in summer by a steamboat daily to 
the Isles of Shoals. The city is pleasantly'situated, mainly on a 
peninsula, and has three public parks. Portsmouth attracts 
many visitors during the summer season. In Portsmouth are 
an Athenaeum (181 7), with a valuable library; a public library 
(i88i);a city hall; a county court house; a United States 
customs-house; a soldiers' and sailors' monument; an equestrian

a cottage hospital (1886); a United States naval hospital (1801); 
a home for aged and indigent women (1877) ; and the Chase home 
for children (1877). 

A United States navy yard, officially known as the Portsmouth 
Navy Yard, is on an island of the Piscataqua but within the 
township of Kittery, Maine. In 1800 Fernald's Island was 
purchased by the Federal government for a navy yard; it was 
the scene of considerable activity during the War of 1812, but 
was of much greater importance during the Civil War, when the 
famous " Kcarsargc " and several other war vessels were huilt 
here. 1 In 1866 the yard was enlarged by connecting Seavey's 
Island with Fernald's; late in the 19th century it was equipped 
for building and repairing steel vessels. It now has a large 
stone dry dock. On Seavey's Island Admiral Cervera and other 
Spanish officers and sailors captured during the Spanish- 
American War were held prisoners in July — Septemher 1898. 
Subsequently a large naval prison was erected. In 1905 the 
treaty ending the war between Japan and Russia was negotiated 
in what is known as the Peace Building in this yard. 

In 1905 the city's factory products were valued at $2,602,056. 
During the summer season there is an important trade with the 
neighbouring watering-places; there is also a large transit trade 
in imported coal, hut the foreign commerce, consisting wholly of 
imports, is small. 

Portsmouth and Dover are the oldest permanent settlements 
in the state. David Thomson with a small company from 
Plymouth, England, in the spring or early summer of 1623 
built and fortified a house at Little Harbor (now Odiornc's 
Point in the township of Rye) as a fishing and trading station. 
In 1630 there arrived another band of settlers sent over by the 
Laconia Company. They occupied Thomson's house and 
Great Island (New Castle) and built the " Great House " on 
what is now Water Street, Portsmouth. This settlement, with 
jurisdiction over all the territory now included in Portsmouth, 
New Castle and Greenland, and most of that in Rye, was 
known as " Strawberry Banke " until 1653, when it was incor- 
porated (by the government of Massachusetts) under the name 
of Portsmouth. There was from the first much trouhle between 
its Anglican settlers sent over by Mason and the Puritans from 
Massachusetts, and in 1641 Massachusetts extended her juris- 
diction over this region. In 1679, however, New Hampshire 
was constituted a separate province, and Portsmouth was the 
capital until 1775. In 1693 New Castle (pop. 1900, 581), then 
including the greater part of the present township of Rye, was 
set apart from Portsmouth, and in 1703 Greenland (pop. 1000, 
607) was likewise set apart. One of the first military exploits 
of the War of Independence occurred at New Castle, where there 
was then a fort called William and Mary. In December 1774 a 
copy of the order prohibiting the exportation of military stores 
to America was^ brought from Boston to Portsmouth by Paul 
Revere, whereupon the Portsmouth Committee of Safety 
organized militia companies, and captured the fort (Dec, 14). 
In 1849 Portsmouth was chartered as a city. 

Portsmouth was the birthplace of Governor Benning Wentworth 
(1696-1770) and his nephew Governor John Wentworth (1 737— 
1820); of Governor John Langdon (1739-1810); of Tobias Lear 
(1762-1816), the private secretary of General Washington from 
1785 until Washington's death, consul-general at Santo Domingo 
in 1802-1804, and negotiator of a treaty with Tripoli in 1805; of 
Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber (1814-1890), humorist, who is 
best known by his Life and Sayings of Mrs Partington (1854); 
of James T. Fields, of Thomas Bailey Aldrich and of General 
Fitz John Porter. From 1807 to 181 6 Portsmouth was the home 
of Daniel Webster. 

PORTSMOUTH, a city and the county-seat of Scioto county, 
Ohio, U.S.A., picturesquely situated at the confluence of the 
Scioto and Ohio rivers, 95 m. S. of Columbus. Pop. (1910 
U.S. census) 23,481. Portsmouth is served by the Baltimore & 

1 See Captain G. H. Preble, " Vessels of War built at Portsmouth, 
N. H. 1 690-1 868," in New England Historical and Genealogical 
Register, vol. xxii. (Boston, 1868); and W. E. Fentress, Centennial 
History of the U.S. Navy Yard at Portsmouth, N. H. (Portsmouth, 
1876). 



Ohio South-Western, the Chesapeake & Ohio and the Norfolk 
& Western railways, also by passenger and freight hoats to 
Pittsburg, Cincinnati and intermediate ports. The city has a 
Carnegie lihrary, a municipal hospital, an aged women's home 
and a children's home. Extending along the Ohio for 8 m. and 
arranged in three groups are works of the " Mound Builders." 
There are two small city parks, and a privately owned resort, 
Millbrook Park. The surrounding country is a fine farming 
region, which also abounds in coal, fire-clay and huilding stone. 
Natural gas is used for light, heat and power. In 1905 the city's 
factory products were valued at $7,970,674, of which $4,258,855 
was the value of hoots and shoes. The Norfolk & Western has 
division terminals here. 

The first permanent settlement in the immediate vicinity 
was made in 1796. In 1799 Thomas Parker, of Alexandria, 
Virginia, laid out a village (which was named Alexandria) below 
the mouth of the Scioto, but as the ground was frequently flooded 
the village did not thrive, and ahout 1810 the inhabitants 
removed to Portsmouth. Portsmouth was laid out in 1803, 
incorporated as a town in 1815, and chartered as a city in 1851. 
The Ohio and Erie canal was opened from Cleveland to 
Portsmouth in 1832. 

PORTSMOUTH, a city of Norfolk county, Virginia, U.S.A., 
on the Elizabeth river opposite Norfolk. Pop. (1910, census), 
33,190. Portsmouth is served by the Atlantic Coast Line, the 
Seahoaftl Air Line, the Chesapeake & Ohio and the New York, 
Philadelphia & Norfolk (Pennsylvania system), the Southern, 
and the Norfolk & Western railways, by steamboat lines to 
Washington, Baltimore, New York, Providence and Boston, by 
ferries to Norfolk, and by electric lines to numerous suburhs. 
There is a 30-ft. channel to the ocean. Portsmouth is situated 
on level ground only a few feet ahove the sea; it has ahout 2$ m. 
of water-front, and adjoins one of the richest trucking districts 
in the Southern States. Among the principal buildings are the 
county court house, city hall, commercial building, United 
States naval hospital, post office building, high school and 
the Portsmouth orphan asylum, King's Daughters' hospital 
and the old Trinity Church (1762). In the southern part of the 
city is a United States navy yard and station, officially the 
Norfolk Yard (the second largest in the country), of about 450 
acres, with three immense dry docks, machine shops, ware- 
houses, travelling and water cranes, a training station, torpedo- 
boat headquarters, a powder plant (20 acres), a naval magazine, 
a naval hospital and the distribution headquarters of the United 
State Marine Corps. The total value of the city's factory 
products in 1905 was only $145,439. The city is a centre of the 
Virginia oyster " fisheries." Portsmouth and Norfolk form a 
customs district, Norfolk heing the port of entry, whose exports 
in 1908 were valued at $11,326,817, and imports at $1,150,044. 

Portsmouth was established by act of the Virginia assembly 
in 1752, incorporated as a town in 1852 and chartered as a city 
in 1858. Though situated in Norfolk county, the city has heen 
since its incorporation administratively independent of it. 
Shortly before the War of Independence the British established 
a marine yard where the navy yard now is, but during the war 
it was confiscated by Virginia and in 1801 was sold to the United 
States. In April 1861 it was hurned and abandoned by the 
Federals, and for a year afterwards was the chief navy yard 
of the Confederates. Here was constructed the iron-clad 
" Virginia " (the old " Merrimac "), which on the 9th of March 
1862 fought in Hampton Roads (q.v.) the famous engagement 
with the " Monitor." Two months later, on the 9th of May, 
the Confederates abandoned the navy yard and evacuated 
Norfolk and Portsmouth, and the " Virginia " was destroyed 
by her commander, Josiah TattnaD. 

PORT SUDAN, a town and harbour on the west coast of the 
Red Sea, in 19 37' N. 37 12' E., 700 m. by boat S. of Suez and 
495 m. by rail N.E. of Khartum. Pop. (1006), 4289. It is the 
principal port of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and the headquar- 
ters of the customs administration. The coral reefs fringing 
the coast are here broken by a straight channel with deep water 
giving access to the harbour, which consists of a series of natural

channels and basins. The largest basin is 900 yds. long by 500 
broad and has a minimum depth of 6 fathoms. On the north 
side of the inlet are quays (completed 1909), fitted with electric 
cranes, &c. Here are the customs-house, -coal sheds and goods 
station. The town proper lies on the south side of the inlet, 
connected with the quays by a railway bridge. Besides govern- 
ment offices the public buildings include hospitals, and a branch 
of the Gordon College of Khartum. Beyond the bridge in the 
upper waters of the inlet is a dry dock. The climate of Port 
Sudan is very hot and damp and fever is common. Adjacent 
to the town is an arid plain without vegetation other than 
mimosa thorns. Some 10 m. west is a line of hills parallel to 
the coast. 

The port dates from 1905. It owes its existence to the desire 
of the Sudan administration to find a harbour more suitable 
than Suakin (q.v.) for the commerce of the country. Such a place 
was found in Mersa Sheikh Barghut (or Barud), 36 m. north 
of Suakin, a harbour so named from a saint whose tomb is promi- 
nent on the northern point of the entrance. When the building 
of the railway between the Nile and the Red Sea was begun, it 
was determined to create a port at this harbour — which was 
renamed Port Sudan (Bander es-Sudan). Up to the end of 
1909 the total expenditure by the government alone on the 
town and harbour- works was ££914,320. The railway (which 
has termini both at Port Sudan and Suakin) was opened in 
January 1906 and the customs-house in the May following. 
Port Sudan immediately attracted a large trade, the value of 
goods passing through it in 1906 exceeding £470,000. In 1908 
the imports and exports were valued at about £750,000. It is a 
regular port of call of British, German and Italian steamers. 
The imports are largely cotton goods, provisions, timber and 
cement; the exports gum, raw cotton, ivory, sesame, durra, 
senna, coffee (from Abyssinia), goat skins, &c. Forty miles 
north of Port Sudan is Mahommed Gul, the port for the mines 
of Gebet, worked by an English company. 

The Foreign Office Report, Trade of Port Sudan for the Year IQ06, 
by T. B. Hohler, gives a valuable account of the beginnings of the 
port. A chart of the harbour was issued by the British Admiralty 
in 1908. See also Sudan: § Anglo-Egyptian. 

PORT TOWNSEND, a city, port of entry and the county-seat 
of Jefferson county, Washington, U.S.A., on Quimper Peninsula, 
at the entrance to Puget Sound, about 40 m. N.N.W. of Seattle. 
Pop. (1905), 5300; (1910), 4181. The city is served by the Port 
Townsend Southern railway (controlled by the Northern Pacific, 
but operated independently) and by steamship lines to Victoria 
(British Columbia), San Francisco, Alaska and Oriental ports. 
The harbour is 75 m. long and 35 m, wide, and is deep, well 
sheltered and protected by three forts, of which Fort Worden is 
an excellently equipped modern fortification ranking with the 
forts at Portland (Maine), San Francisco, Boston and New York. 
The United States government has at Port Townsend a customs- 
house, a revenue cutter service, a marine hospital, a quarantine 
station and an immigration bureau. Port Townsend is the port of 
entry for the Puget Sound customs district. In 1908 its exports 
were valued at $37,547,553? much more than those of any other 
American port of entry on the Pacific; its imports were valued 
in 1908 at $21,876,361, being exceeded among the Pacific ports 
by those of San -Francisco only. The city has a considerable 
trade in grain, lumber, fish, livestock, dairy products and oil; 
its manufactures include boilers, machinery and canned and 
pickled fish, especially salmon and herring. Port Townsend was 
settled in 1854, incorporated as a town in i860 and chartered 
as a city in 1890. 

PORTUGAL, a republic of western Europe, forming part of 
the Iberian Peninsula, and bounded on the N. and E. by Spain, 
and on the S. and W. by the Atlantic Ocean. Pop. (1900), 
5,016,267; area, 34,254 sq. m. These totals do not include the 
inhabitants and area of the Azores and Madeira Islands, which 
are officially regarded as parts of continental Portugal. In shape 
the country resembles a roughly drawn parallelogram, with 
its greatest length (362 m.) from N. to S., and its greatest 
breadth (T40 m.) from E. to W. For map, see Spain. The 



land frontiers are to some extent denned by the course of th 
four principal rivers, the Minho and Douro in the north, the 
Tagus and Guadiana in the south; elsewhere, and 
especially in the north, they are marked by moun- a™fco£t s 
tain ranges; but in most parts their delimitation was 
originally based on political considerations. In no sense can 
the boundary-line be called either natural or scientific, apart 
from the fact that the adjacent districts on either side are poor, 
sparsely peopled, and therefore little liable to become a subject 
of dispute. The Portuguese seaboard is nearly 500 m. long, and 
of the six ancient provinces all are maritime except Traz-os- 
Montes. From the extreme north to Cape Mondego and thence 
onward to Cape Carvoeiro the outline of the coast is a long and 
gradual curve; farther south is the prominent mass of rock and 
mountain terminating westward in Capes Roca and Espichel; 
south of this, again, there is another wide curve, broken by the 
headland of Sines, and extending to Cape St Vincent, the south- 
eastern extremity of the country. The only other conspicuous 
promontory is Cape Santa Maria, on the south coast. The only 
deep indentations of the Portuguese littoral are the lagoon of 
Aveiro (q.v.) and the estuaries of the Minho, Douro, Mondego, 
Tagus, Sado and Guadiana, in which are the principal harbours. 
The only islands off the coast are the dangerous Farilhoes and 
Berlings (Portuguese Berlengas) off Cape Carvoeiro. 

Physical Features. -r-Few small countries contain so great a 
variety of scenery as Portugal. The bleak and desolate heights 
of the Serra da Estrella and the ranges of the northern frontier 
are almost alpine in character, although they nowhere reach 
the limit of perpetual snow. At a lower level there are wide 
tracts of moorland, covered in many cases with sweet-scented 
cistus and other wild flowers. The lagoon of Aveiro, the estuary 
of the Sado and the broad inland lake formed by the Tagus above 
Lisbon (q.v.) f recall the waterways of Holland. The sand-dunes 
of the western coast and the Pinhal de Leiria (q.v.) resemble the 
French Landes. The Algarve and parts of Alemtejo might be- 
long £0 North-West Africa rather than to Europe. The Paiz do 
Vinho, on the Douro, and the Tagus near Abrantes, with their 
terraced bush-vines grown up the steep banks of the rivers, are 
often compared with the Rhine and the Elbe. The harbours 
of Lisbon and Oporto are hardly inferior in beauty to those of 
Naples and Constantinople. Apart from this variety, and from 
the historic interest of such places as Braga, Bussaco, Cintra, 
Coimbra, or Torres Vedras, the attractiveness of the country is 
due to its colouring, and not to grandeur of form. Its landscapes 
are on a small scale; it has no vast plains, no inland seas, no 
mountain as high as 7000 ft. But its flora is the richest in 
Europe, and combines with the brilliant sunshine, the vivid hut 
harmonious costumes of the peasantry, and the white or pale- 
tinted houses to compensate for any such deficiency. This 
wealth of colour gives to the scenery of Portugal a quite distinc- 
tive character and is the one feature common to all its varieties. 

The orography of Portugal cannot be scientifically studied except 
in relation to that of Spain, for there is no dividing line between 
the principal Portuguese ranges and the highlands of Galicia, 
Leon and Spanish Estremadura. Three so-called Portuguese 
systems are sometimes distinguished: (1) the Transmontane, 
stretching between the Douro and the Minho; (2) the Beirene, 
between the Douro and the Tagus; (3) the Transtagine, south of 
the Tagus. The following ranges belong to the Transmontane 
system, which is the southern extension of the mountains of 
Galicia: Peneda (4728 ft.), forming the watershed between the 
river Lima and the lower Minho; the Serra do Gerez (4817 ft.)* 
which rises like a gigantic wall between the Lima and the Homem, 
and sends off a spur known as the Amarella, Oural and Nora, 
south-westward between the Homem and the Cavado; La Raya 
Seca, a continuation of Gerez, which culminates in Larouco (4390 ft.) 
and contains the sources of the Cavado; Cabreira (4196 ft.), 
which contains the sources of the river Ave and separates the 
basin of the Tamega from that of the Cavado; Marao (4642 ft.), 
Villarelho .(3547 ft.) and Padrella (3763 ft.), forming together a 
large massif between the rivers Tamega, Tua and Douro; and 
Nogueira (4331 ft.) and Bornes (3944 ft.), which divide the valley of 
the Tua from that of the Sabor. The Beirene system comprise? 
two quite distinct mountain regions. * North of the Mondsgo it 
includes Montemuro (4534 ft.), separating the Douro from the upper 
waters of its left-hand tributary the Paiva; Gralheira (3681 ft.) 
between the Paiva and the Vouga; the Serra do Caramullo

(351 1 ft.), between the Vouga and the Dao; and the Serra da 
Lapa (3215 ft.), which gives rise to the Paiva, Tavora, Vouga and 
Dao. South of these ranges, but nominally included in the same 
system, is the Serra da Estrella, the loftiest ridge in Portugal 
(6532 ft.). The Estrella Mountains, which enclose the headwaters of 
the Mondego in a deep ravine, stretch from north-east to south-west 
and arc continued in the same direction by the Serra de Lousa 
(3944 ft.). They form the last link in the chain of mountain ranges, 
known to Spanish geographers as the Carpetano-Vetonica, which 
extends across the centre of the Peninsula from east to west. The 
greater part of the Serra da Estrella constitutes the watershed 
between the Mondego and Zezere. Lesser ranges, which are 
included in the Bcirenc system and vary in height from 2000 to 
4000 ft., are the Mesas, between the rivers C6a and Zezere; the 
Guardunha and Moradal, separating the Zezere from the Ponsul 
and Ocrcza, tributaries of the Tagus; the Serra do Aire, and various 
ridges which stretch south-westward as far as the mountains of 
Cintra (q.v.). The Transtaginc Mountains cannot rightly .be 
described as a single system, as they consist for the most part of 
isolated ranges or massifs. The Serra da Arrabida (1637 ft.) 
rises between Cape Espichel and Setubal. Sao Mamcdc (3363 ft.), 
with the parallel and lower Serra de Portalcgrc, extends along part 
of the frontier of northern Alcmtejo. Ossa (2129 ft.), Caixeiro 
(1483 ft.)t Monfurado (1378 ft.) and Mcndro (1332 ft.) form the high 
ground between the rivers Sado, Sorraia and Guadiana. East of 
the Guadiana the outliers of the Spanish Sierra Morena enter 
Portuguese territory. The Serra Grandola and Monte Cereal, 
two low ranges stretching from north to south, skirt the coast of 
southern Estremadura. In the extreme south the ranges arc 
more closely massed together. They include Monchique, with 
the peak of Foya or Foia (2963 ft.), and various lower ranges. 
There are numerous large expanses of level country, the most 
notable of these being the plains (campos) of the Tagus valley, and 
of Aviz or Benavilla, Bcja and Ounque, in Alemtejo; the high 

Clateaux (cimas) of Mogadouro in Traz-os-Montes and Ourcm 
etween the Tagus and the upper Sorraia; the highly cultivated 
lowlands (veigas) of Chaves and Valcnga do Minho in the extreme 
north; and the marshy flats (baixas) along the coast of Alcmtejo 
and the southern shore of the lower Tagus. 

The three principal rivers which flow through^ Portugal to the 
sea— the Douro, Tagus and Guadiana — are described in separate 
articles. The chief Portuguese tributaries of the Douro are the 
Tamcga, Tua and Sabor on the north, the Agueda, C6a and Paiva 
on the south; of the Tagus, the Ocreza, Ponsul and Zezere on the 
north, the Niza and Sorraia on the south, while into the Guadiana, 
on its right or Portuguese bank, flow the Caia, Degebe, Cobres, 
Ociras and Vascao. The whole country drains into the Atlantic, 
to which all the main rivers flow in a westerly direction except 
the Guadiana, which turns south by east in the lower part of its 
course. The Minho (Spanish Mifio) is the most northerly river of 
Portugal, and in size and importance is only inferior to the three 
great waterways already mentioned. It rises in the highlands of 
Qilicia, and, after forming for some distance the boundary between 
that province and Entre-Minho-c- Douro, falls into the sea below 
the port of Caminha. Its length is 170 m. Small coasters can 
ascend the river as far as Salvaticrra in Galicia (20 m.), but larger 
vessels arc excluded by a sandy bar at the mouth. Between the 
Minho and Douro the chief rivers are the Lima (Spanish Litnia or 
Antela), which also rises in Galicia, and reaches the sea at Vianna 
do Castcllo; the Cavado, which receives the Homem on the right, 
and forms the port of Espozende in its estuary; and the Ave, which 
ises in the Serra da Cabreira and issues at the f>ort of Villa do 
Condc. Between the Douro and Tagus the Vouga rises in the Serra 
da Lapa and reaches the sea through the lagoon of Aveiro; the 
Mondego flows north-east through a long ravine in the Serra da 
Estrella, and then bends back so as to flow west-south-west. Its 
estuary contains the important harbour of Figucira da Foz; its 
chief tributaries arethc Dao on the right, and the Alva, Ceira and 
Arunea on the left; its length is 125 m. of which 52 m. are navigable 
by small coasters. Several comparatively unimportant streams, 
chief among which arc the Liz and Sizandro, enter the Atlantic 
between the mouths of the Mondego and Tagus. Between the 
Ta^us and Cape St Vincent the principal rivers are the Sado, 
which is formed by the junction of several lesser streams and flows 
north-west to the port of Setubal; and the Mira, which takes a 
similar direction from its headwaters south of Monte Vigia to the 
port of Villa Nova de Milfontcs. On the south coast the united 
waters of the Odclouea and Silves form the harbour of Villa Nova 
de Portimao, and the Algoz, Algibre or Quarteira, and the Asscea 
flow into the sea farther east. Portugal abounds in hot and 
medicinal springs, such as those of Caldas de Monchique, Caldas 
da Rainha and Vidago. 

Geology. — By far the greater part of Portugal is occupied by 
ancient rocks of Archean and Palaeozoic age, and by eruptive 
masses which probably belong to various periods. All the higher 
mountains are formed of these rocks, and it is only near the coast 
and in the plain of the Tagus that later deposits are found. The 
Mesozoic beds form an irregular triangle extending from Lisbon 
and Torres Novas on the south to Oporto on the north. There are 
also a narrow strip along the southern shores of the Algarve and a 



few smaller patches along the western coast. The Tertiary deposits 
cover the plain of the Tagus and are found in other low-lying 
preas near the coast. Of the Lower Palaeozoic rocks the Ordovician 
i opears to be the most widely-spread. Large areas have been 
n xrred to the Cambrian, but it is only at Villa Boim, about 6 m. 
\Y S.W. of Elvas, that Cambrian fossils have been found. The 
Or 'ovician beds have yielded fossils in several places, Vallongo 
anc Bussaco being amongst the best-known localities. The suc- 
cess on is similar to that of Brittany and Spain. Supposed Silurian 
bedi have been described at Portalcgre, and in the same neigh- 
bour :ood Devonian fossils have been found. The Lower Carboni- 
ferous which belongs to the " Culm " facies so widely spread in 
centra 1 Europe, occupies a wide area in southern Portugal; but the 
Upper Carboniferous is very restricted in extent, and occurs in 
small basins like those of the Central Plateau of France, resting 
unconfcrmably upon the rocks below. The deposits in these basins 
consist largely of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, amongst 
which lie seams of coal. It is possible that some of these deposits 
may belong to the Permian or at least to the Pcrma-Carbonifcrous. 
Of the Mcsozoic systems the Jurassic is the most widely-spread. 
Supposed Triassic beds are found, but they are confined chicflv to 
the eastern margin of the Mesozoic area north of Lisbon. The 
Jurassic deposits are partly marine and partly fresh-water or 
terrestrial, including beds of lignite. On the whole, excepting in 
eastern Algarve, the Upper Jurassic beds indicate the neighbourhood 
of a shore-line. The Cretaceous system is very limited in extent. 
Its most interesting feature is the occurrence near its^ summit, 
north of Cape Mondego, of sands and gravels containing plant 
remains. Here both Cretaceous and Tertiary forms are found, 
and the Mondego beds seem to represent the passage between the 
two systems. At the close of the Cretaceous period great eruptions 
of basalt and basaltic tuff took place, especially in the Lisbon area. 
The volcanic rocks then formed are followed by marine deposits 
of Oligocene and Miocene age. Towards the north these are 
associated with fresh-water limestones, indicating the presence of 
land in that direction. Marine Pliocene beds occur at the mouth 
of the Tagus. The contemporaneous beds inland are of fresh- 
water origin. Eruptive masses of various age arc found in many 
localities. The Cintra granite sends veins into the base of the Upper 
Jurassic, and is very probably of Tertiary age. The Serra de 
Monchique is petrographically of great interest. It consists^ chiefly 
of elaeolite-syenite and other rocks derived from the same igneous 
magma. 

Climate. — The climate of Portugal is equable and temperate. 
Lisbon, Coimbra, Evora and Oporto have mean temperatures 
between 6o° and 61*5° F., and the daily variation nowhere exceeds 
23 . This equability of temperature is partly caused by the very 
heavy rainfall precipitated on Portugal as one of the westernmost 
countries of Europe and the one most exposed to the Atlantic. 
The rainfall has been as heavy as 16 ft. in a year, and sometimes, 
as in the winter of 1909-1910, great damage is wrought by floods. 
Heavy fogs are also common along the coast, rendering it dangerous 
to ships. The rainfall is heaviest in the north and on the Serra 
da Estrella; it is least in Algarve. A fine climate and equability 
of temperature are not universal in Portugal ; they are to be enjoyed 
mainly in Bcira and Estremadura, especially at Cintra and Coimbra, 
and in the northern provinces. In the deep valleys^ where the 
mountains keep off the cool winds, it is excessively hot in summer; 
while on the summits of the mountains snow lies for many months. 
The meteorological station on the Serra da Estrella, with a mean 
annual temperature of 44-7°. F., is the coldest spot in Portugal 
in which systematic observations are taken. Montalegre has a 
mean of 48-3° and Guarda of 50-3°. Even in Lisbon the yearly 
variation is not less than 50 °. In Alemtejo the climate is very 
unfavourable, and, though the heat is not so great as in Algarve 
(where Lagos has a mean of 63 °), the country has a more deserted 
appearance; while in winter when the Tagus overflows, un- 
healthy swamps are left. Notwithstanding that Algarve is hotter 
than Alcmtejo, a profuse vegetation takes away much of the tropical 
effect. Portugal is very rarely visited by thunderstorms; but 
shocks of earthquake are frequently felt, and recall the great earth- 
quake of Lisbon (q.v.) in 1755. 

Fauna and Flora. — An account of the fauna of the Iberian 
Peninsula as a whole is given under Spain. Wolves arc found 
in the wilder parts of the Serra da Estrella, and wild boars are 
preserved in some districts. As far as the constituents of its flora 
arc concerned Portugal is not very dissimilar from Spain, but their 
distribution is peculiar. The vegetation of Spain is distributed 
in clearly marked zones; but over the whole of Portugal, except 
the hottest parts of Algarve and Alemtejo, the plants of northern 
Europe flourish side by side with cacti, palms, aloes and tree-ferns 
(see Cintra). This is largely due to the fact that the moisture- 
laden winds from the Atlantic penetrate almost as far inland as 
the Portuguese frontier, but do not reach the interior of Spain. 
The soil is fertile, and the indigenous flora has been greatly enriched 
by the importation of such plants as the agave, the Mexican opuntia, 
the American maple, the Australian eucalyptus, the Scotch fir and 
the so-called Portuguese cypress (Cupressus lusitanica) from the 
Azores. There are many fine tracts of forest, among which may 
be mentioned the famous convent-wood of Bussaco {q.v.); cork

trees are extensively cultivated, Barbary oaks (Quercus ballota, 
Port, azinheira) furnish edible acorns and excellent timber for 
charcoal, and carob-trees (Ceratonia siliqua t Port, alfarrobeira) also 
•produce edible seed-pods somewhat resembling beans. Elms, 
limes and poplars are common north of the Tagus, ilexes, arau- 
carias, myrtles, magnolias and a great variety of conifers in all 
parts. The Serra da Estrella has a rich alpine flora, and the lagoon 
of Aveiro contains a great number of aquatic plants. 

Inhabitants. — The population of Portugal numbered 4,550,699 
in 1878, 5,049,729 in 1890 and 5,423,132 in 1900. These totals 
include the inhabitants of the Azores and Madeira, which 
together amounted to 406,865 in 1900. Few immigrants enter 
the country, but the birth-rate is about 30 per 1000, while the 
mortality is only about 20 per 1000. Large bodies of emigrants, 
chiefly recruited from the sober, hardy and industrious peasantry 
of the northern provinces, annually leave Portugal to seek 
fortune in America. A few go to the Portuguese colonies, the 
great majority to Brazil. Many of these emigrants return with 
considerable savings and settle on the land. The mortality 
is highest among male children, and the normal excess of females 
is in the proportion of 109 to 100. Six-sevenths of the popula- 
tion of continental Portugal inhabit the provinces north of the 
Tagus. The ■ density of population is greatest in Madeira 
(479-5 per sq. m. in 1900), Entre-Minho-e-Douro (419*5) and the 
Azores (277-9)5 nowhere else does it reach 200 per sq. m. In 
Alemtejo [the percentage sinks to 45*1, and for the whole 
country, including the islands, it amounts only to 152-8. 

The Portuguese people is composed of many racial elements. 
Its earliest known ancestors were the Iberians (q.v.). The peas- 
antry, especially in the north, are closely akin to the Galician and 
Asturian Spaniards in character, physique and dialect; and these 
three ethnical groups — Portuguese of the north, Galicians, Astu- 
rians — may perhaps be regarded as the purest representatives of 
the Spanish stock. The first settlers with whom they inter- 
married were probably Carthaginians, who were followed in 
smaller numbers by Greeks; but the attempts which have some- 
times been made to ascribe certain attributes of the Portuguese 
to the influence of these races are altogether fanciful. The 
Romans, whose supremacy was not seriously threatened for 
some six centuries after the Punic Wars, gave to Portugal its 
language and the foundation of its civilization; there is, however, 
no evidence that they seriously modified the physical type or 
character of its people.' In these respects the Suevic and 
Visigothic conquests left a more permanent impression, especially 
in the northern provinces. After 711 came the long period of 
Moorish (i.e. Arab and Berber) predominance. The influence of 
the Moors was greatest south of the Tagus. In Alemtejo, and 
still more in Algarve, Arab and Berber types are common; and 
the influence of these races can everywhere be discerned in the 
architecture, handicrafts and speech of the peasantry. So 
complete was the intellectual triumph of the Moors that an 
intermediate " Mozarabic " population arose, Portuguese in 
blood, Christian in religion, but Arab in language and manners. 
Many of the Mozarabs even adopted the characteristic Mahom- 
medan rite of circumcision. Under the tolerant rule of Islam 
the Portuguese Jews rose to a height of wealth and culture 
unparalleled in Europe; they intermarried with the Christians 
both at 'this period and after their forced conversion by King 
Emanuel I. (1495-1521). After 1450 yet another ethnical 
element was introduced into the nation, through the importation 
of African slaves in vast numbers. Negroid types are common 
throughout central and southern Portugal. No European race 
confronted with the problem of an immense coloured population 
has solved it more successfully than the Portuguese and their 
kinsmen in Brazil; in both countries intermarriage was freely 
resorted to, and the offspring of these mixed unions are superior 
in character and intelligence to most half-breeds. 

National Characteristics. — The normal type evolved from 
this fusion of many races is dark-haired, sallow-skinned, brown- 
eyed and of low stature. The poorer classes, above all the fisher- 
men and small farmers, are physically much finer than the well- 
to-do, who are prone to excessive stoutness owing to their more 
sedentary habits. The staple diet of the labouring classes and 



small farmers is fish, especially the dried codfish called bacalfido, 
rice, beans, maize bread and meal, olive oil, fruit and vegetables. 
Meat is rarely eaten except on festivals. In Alemtejo chestnuts 
and figs are important articles of diet. Drunkenness is extremely 
rare. There is no single national dress, but a great variety of 
picturesque costumes are worn. The sashes, broad-brimmed 
hats and copper-tipped quarterstaves of the men, and the bril- 
liant cotton dresses and gold or silver filigree ornaments worn on 
holidays by the women are common throughout the country; 
but many classes have their own costumes, varying in detail 
according to the district or province. These costumes may be 
seen at their best at bull-fights and at such popular festivals 
as the romarias or pilgrimages, which combine religion with the 
attractions of a fair. The national sport of bull-fighting (q.v.) 
is conducted as humanely as possible, for the Portuguese are 
lovers of animals. The artistic sense of the nation is perhaps 
greatest among the peasantry, although Portugal has the most 
illiterate peasantry in western Europe. It is manifested in 
their poetry and music even more than in their admirable 
costumes and in the good taste which has preserved the Roman 
or Moorish forms of their domestic pottery. Even the men and 
women who till the soil are capable of improvizing verse of real 
merit, and sometimes excel in the ancient and difficult art of 
composing extempore amoebean rhymes. In this way, although 
the ancient ballads are not forgotten, new words are also fitted 
to the plaintive folk-tunes (fados) which every farm-hand knows 
and sings, accompanied sometimes by a rude clarinet or bag- 
pipes, but more frequently by the so-called Portuguese guitar — 
an instrument which resembles a mandolin rather than the 
guitars of Italy and Spain. The native dances, slow but not 
ungraceful, and more restrained than those of Andalusia or the 
south of France, are obviously Moorish in origin, and depend for 
their main effects on the movement of the arms and body. Many 
curious superstitions survive in the country districts, including 
the beliefs in witches (feitiqeiras, bruxas) and werewolves (lobis- 
hornens) ; in sirens (sereias) which haunt the dangerous coast and 
lure fishermen to destruction; in fairies (fadas) and in many 
kinds of enchantment. It will be observed that the nomen- 
clature of Portuguese folk-lore suggests that the popular supersti- 
tions are of the most diverse origin — Latin, Greek, Arabic, 
native: lobishomem is the Latin lupus homo, wolf -man, sereia 
is the Greek vetprjv, bruxa is Arabic, feiticeira and fada Portuguese. 
Other beliefs can be traced to Jewish and African sources. 

Chief Towns. — The chief towns of Portugal are Lisbon (pop. 
1 900, 3 56,009) , the capital and principal seaport ; Oporto 
(167,955), the capital of the northern provinces and, after Lisbon, 
the most important centre of trade; the seaports of Setubal 
(22,074), Ilhavo (12,617), Povoa de Varzim (12,623), Tavira 
(12,175), Faro (11,789), Ovar (10,462), Olhao (10,009) Vianna do 
Castello (10,000), Aveiro (9975), Lagos (8291), Leixoes (7690) 
and Figueira da Foz (6221); and the inland cities or towns of 
Braga (24,202), Louie (22,478), Coimbra (18,144), Evora (16,020), 
Covilha (15,469), Elvas (13,981), Portalegre (11,820), Palmeila 
(11,478), Torres Novas (10,746), Silves (9687), Lamego (9471), 
Guimaraes (9104), Beja (8885), Santarem (8628), Vizeu (8057), 
Estremoz (7920), Monchique (7345), Castello Branco (7288), 
Abrantes (7255), Torres Vedras (6900), Thomar (6888), Villa 
Real (6716), Chaves (6388), Guarda (6124), Cintra (591 4), 
Braganza (5535), Mafra (4769), Leiria (44S9), Batalha (3858), 
Almeida (2330), Alcobaca (2309), Bussaco (1661). All these are 
described in separate articles. 

Communications. — Up to 1851 there was practically no good 
carriage road in the country except the highway between Lisbon 
and Cintra. In 1853 the work of constructing a proper system of 
roads was undertaken, and by the end of the century all the larger 
towns were linked together by the main or " royal " highways 
to which the " district " and a municipal " roads were subsidiary. 
Each class of road was named after the authority responsible for its 
construction and upkeep. In some of the remoter rural districts 
there are only bridle-paths, or rough tracks, which become almost 
impassable in wet seasons, and are never suitable for vehicles less 
solid than the Portuguese ox-carts. The first railway was opened 
in 1853 to connect Lisbon with Badajoz. In 1910 1758 m. were 
completed, of which 672 m. were state lines. The Portuguese

railways meet the Spanish at Valenca do Minho on the northern 
frontier, at Barca a Alva, at Villar Formoso, near Valencia de 
Alcantara, and near Badajoz on the eastern frontier. In some of 
the chief towns there are electric tramways. The most important 
internal waterways are the lower Tagus and the Douro between 
Oporto and the Paiz do Vinho. In 1908, 11,045 vessels of 19,354.967 
tons entered Portuguese seaports, but a very large majority of 
these ships were foreign, and especially British. The postal and 
telegraphic services are adequate; telephone systems are installed 
in Lisbon, Oporto and other lar^e towns; and the Eastern Telegraph 
Co. has an important cable station at Carcavellos near Lisbon (q.v.). 
Land Tenure. — Four modes of land tenure are common in 
Portugal. The poor and thinly-peopled region of Alemtejo is 
divided into large estates, and cultivated by tenant farmers. 
Numerous estates in various provinces are held on the metayage 
system (q.v.). In the north, where the land is much subdivided, 

C:\sant proprietorship and a kind of emphyteusis (see Roman 
i\\) are the most usual tenures. The Portuguese form of emphy- 
teusis is called aforamento; the landlord parts with the user 01 his 
property in exchange for a quit-rent (Joro or canon). He may 
evict his tenant should the^ rent be in arrear for five years, and 
may at any time distrain if it be overdue; but he cannot otherwise 
interfere with the holding, which the tenant may improve or 
neglect. Should the tenant sell or exchange his interest in the 
property, the right of pre-emption is vested in the landlord, and 
a corresponding right is enjoyed by the tenant should the quit- 
reut be for sale. As this tenure* is very ancient, though modified 
in 1832 and 1867, the value of such holdings has been greatly 
enhanced with the improvement of the land and the decline in 
the purchasing power 01 currency. 

Agriculture. — Many of the instruments and processes of Portu- 
guese agriculture and viticulture were introduced by the Romans, 
and are such as Columella described in the 1st century a.d. The 
characteristic springless ox-cart which is used for heavy loads 
may be seen represented on Roman frescoes of even earlier date. 
One form of plough still used consists of a crooked bough, with an 
iron share attached. Oxen are employed for all field-work; those 
of the commonest breed are tawny, of great muscular power, very 
docile, and with horns measuring 5 or 6 ft. from tip to tip. The 
ox-yokes are often elaborately carved in a traditional pattern in 
which Gothicand Moorish designs are blended. The Moors intro- 
duced many improvements, especially] in the system of irrigation; 
the characteristic Portuguese wells with their perpetual chains or 
buckets are of Moorish invention, and retain their Moorish name of 
noras. In all, rather more than 45% of the country is uncultivated, 
chiefly in Alemtejo, Traz-os-Montes and the Serra da Estrella. 
The principal grain-crops are maize, wheat and rye; rice is grown 
among the marshes of the coast. Gourds, pumpkins, cabbages 
and other vegetables are cultivated amongj the cereals.. The 
large onions sold in Great Britain as Spanish are extensively pro- 
duced in the northern provinces. Every district has its vine- 
yards, the finest of which are in the Paiz do Vinho (see Oporto 
and Wine). The bush vines of thisregion are more exposed to 
the attacks of Oidium Tuckeri, which invaded the country in 1851, 
and of Phylloxera vastatrix, which followed in 1863, than the more 
deeply- rooted vines trained on trellises or trees. Both these pests 
have been successfully combated, largely by the use of sulphur and 
by grafting immune American vines upon native stocks. In 
addition to grapes the commoner fruits include quinces, apples, 
pears, cherries, limes, lemons and loquats (Port, nesiras) ; Condeixa 
is famous for oranges, Amarante /or peaches, Elvas for plums, 
the southern provinces for carobs and figs. Large quantities of 
olive oil are manufactured south of the Douro. Almost all cattle, 
except fighting-bulls, are stall-fed. The fighting-bulls are chiefly 
reared in the marshes and alluvial valleys; they are bred for strength 
and swiftness rather than size, and a good specimen should be 
sufficiently agile to leap over the inner barrier of the arena (about 
68 in. high). Large herds of swine are fed in the oak and chestnut 
woods of Alemtejo; sheep and goats are reared in the mountains, 
where excellent cheeses are made from goats' milk. 

Fisheries. — About 50,000 Portuguese are classed as hunters and 
fishermen. The majority of these are employed in the sardine, 
and tunny fisheries. This industry is carried on in a fleet of more 
than io.ooo small vessels, including the whalers of the Azores and 
the cod-boats which operate outside Portuguese waters. The 
fishermen and fisherwomen form a quite distinct class of the people; 
both sexes are noted for their bodily strength, and the men for 
their bold and skilful seamanship. Tunny and sardines are cured 
and exported in large quantities, oysters are also exported, and 
many other sea fish, such as hake, sea-bream, whiting, conger 
and various flat-fish are consumed in the country. In the early 
years of the 20th century the competition of foreign steam trawlers 
inflicted much hardship on the fishermen. The average yearly 
value of the fish landed in Portugal (exclusive of cured fish from 
foreign countries) is about £800,000. Salmon, lampreys and eels 
are caught in some of the larger rivers; trout abound in the streams 
of the northern provinces; but many fresh-water fish common 
elsewhere in Europe, including pike, perch, tench and chub, are 
not found. 



Mines. — It is usually stated that Portugal is rich in minerals, 
especially copper, but that want of capital and, especially in the 
south, of transport and labour, has retarded their exploitation. 
The mineral deposits of the country are very varied, but their 
extent is probably exaggerated. The average yearly output from 
1 90 1 to 1905 was worth less than £300,000. Copper is mined in 
southern Portugal. Common salt (chiefly from Alcacer do Sal 
near Setubal), gypsum, lime and marble are exported; marble and 
granite of fine quality abound in the southern provinces. Iron is 
obtained near Beja^ and Evora, tin in the district of Braganza. 
Lead, wolfram, antimony and auriferous quartz exist in the dis- 
tricts of Coimbra, Evora, Beja and Faro. Lignite occurs at many 
points around Coimbra, Leiria and Santarem; asphalt abounds 
near Alcobaca; phosphorite, asbestos and sulphur are common 
south of the Tagus. Petroleum has been found near Torres Vedras; 
pitchblende, arsenic, anthracite and zinc are also mined. Gold 
was washed from some of the Portuguese rivers before the Christian 
era, and among the Romans the auriferous sands of the Tagus 
were proverbially famous; it is, however, extremely improbable 
that large quantities of gold were ever obtained in this region, 
although small deposits of alluvial gold may still be found in the 
valleys of the Tagus and Mondego. 

Manufactures. — The Met hue n Treaty of 1703 prevented the 
establishment of some manufacturing industries in Portugal by 
securing a monopoly for British textiles, and it was only after 1892 
that Portuguese cotton-spinning and weaving were fostered by 
heavy protective duties. In 20 years these industries became the 
most important in the country after agriculture, the wine and 
cork trades and the fisheries. In connexion with the wine trade 
there are many large cooperages; cork products are extensively 
manufactured for export. Lisbon is the headquarters of the 
ship-building trade. Here, and in other cities, tanning, distilling, 
various metallurgical industries, and^ manufactures of soap, flour, 
tobacco, &c, are carried on; the entire output is sold in Portugal 
or its colonies. There is a steady trade in natural mineral waters, 
which occur in many parts of continental Portugal and the Azores. 
Frorn the 16th century to the 18th many artistic handicrafts were 
practised by the Portuguese in imitation of the fine pottery, cabinet- 
work, embroideries, &c, which they imported from India and Persia. 
Portuguese cabinet-work deteriorated in the io,th century; the glass- 
works and potteries of the Ayeiro and Leiria districts have lost 
much of their ancient reputation; and even the exquisite lace of 
Peniche and Vianna do^Castello is strangely neglected abroad. 
The finest Caldas da Rainha china-ware, with its fantastic repre- 
sentations of birds, beasts and fishes, still commands a fair/ price 
in foreign markets; but the blue and white ware originally copied 
from Delft and later modified under the influence of Persian pottery 
is now only manufactured in small quantities, of inferior quality. 
Skilful copies of Moorish metal-work may be purchased in the gold- 
smiths' and silversmiths' shops of Lisbon and Oporto; conspicuous 
among these are the filigree ornaments which are bought by the 
peasant women as investments and by foreign visitors as curiosities. 
In 1900 the total industrial population of Portugal was 455,296. 

Commerce. — The annual value of the foreign trade of Portugal 
amounts approximately to £19,000,000. The following table shows 
the value for five years of the exports, and of all imports not re- 
exported (exclusive of coin and bullion) : — - . -

In 19 10 the principal exports, in order of value, were wine (chiefly 
port, common wines and Madeira), raw and manufactured cork, 
preserved fish, fruits and vegetables, cottons and yarn, copper ore, 
timber, olive oil, skins, grain and flour, tobacco and wool. The 
imports were raw and manufactured cotton, wool and silk, wheat 
and maize, coal, iron and machinery, dried codfish, sugar, rice, 
hides and skins, oils. The United Kingdom, which annually 
purchases wine to the value of about £900,000 and cork to the 
value of about £500,000, is the chief consumer of Portuguese goods, 
and the chief exporter to Portugal. Germany and the United 
States rank respectively second and third among the countries 
which export to Portugal; Spain, which buys bullocks and pigs, 
Brazil, which buys wine, and the Portuguese colonies, which buy 
textiles, are among the chief purchasers of Portuguese products. 
In addition to its direct foreign commerce Portugal derives much 
benefit from its share in the trade between South America and 
Europe. Large liners from Liverpool, Southampton, London, 
Hamburg, Havre and Antwerp call regularly for passengers or 
cargo at Leixoes or Lisbon, or both ports, on their way to and 
from South America (especially Brazil). In connexion with this 
trade an important tourist traffic, chiefly from Great Britain and 
Germany, was developed towards the end of the 19th century. 
_ Banks and Money.— In 1910 the Bank of Portugal, to which the 



i 3 8 



PORTUGAL 



[CONSTITUTION 



treasury was deeply indebted, had a capital of £1,500,000, and a 
monopoly of note issue in continental Portugal, but the notes of the 
Ultramarine Bank circulated in the colonies. The notes of the Bank 
of Portugal in circulation amounted in value to about £14,000,000. 
For an account of the Monte Pio Geral, which is a combined bank, 
pawnbroking establishment and benefit society, see Pawnbroking; 
the deposits in the Monte Pio and the State Savings Bank amounted 
in 19 10 to some £5,228,000. There are also many private banks, 
including savings banks. Gold is the standard of value, but the 
actual currency is chiefly Bank of Portugal notes. The values of 
coin and notes are expressed in multiples of the real (plural rets), 
a monetary unit which does not actually exist. The milreis, 1000 
reis of the par value of 4s. §d. (or 4-5 milreis to the pound sterling) and 
the conto of reis (1000 milreis) are used for the calculation of large 
sums. Gold pieces of 10, 5, 2 and 1 milreis were coined up to 
1891 ; 10, 5, and 2 testoon (teslao) pieces, worth respectively 1000, 
500 and 200 reis, arc coined in silver; testoons of 100 reis and half 
testoons of 50 reis,, in nickel ; pieces of 20, 10 and 5 reis in bronze. 
The milreis fluctuates widely in value, the balance of exchange 
being usually adverse to Portugal; for the purposes of this article 
the milreis has been taken at par. The British sovereign is legal 
tender for 4500 reis, but in practice usually commands a premium. 
The metric system of weights and measures has been officially 
adopted, but many older standards are used, such as the libra 
(1-012 lb avoirdupois), alqueire (0-36 imperial bushel), moio (2-78 
imp. bushels), almude of Lisbon (3*7 imp. gallons) and almude of 
Oporto (5-6 imp. gallons). 

Finance. — For the five financial years, 1 901-1902 to 1 905-1 906, 
the average revenue of Portugal was about £13,300,000 and the 
average expenditure £13,466,000. The chief sources of revenue 
were customs duties, taxes on land and industries, duties on tobacco 
and breadstuffs, the Lisbon octroi, receiptsfrom national property, 
registration and stamps, &c. The heaviest expenditure (nearly 
£5,000,000) was incurred for the service of the consolidated debt; 
payments for the civil list, cortes, pensions, &c, amounted to more 
than £2,000,000, and the cost of public works to nearly as large 
a sum. The ministries of war and marine together spent about 
£2,500,000 each year. The practice of meeting deficits by loans, 
together with the great expenditure, after 1853, on public works, 
especially roads and railways, explains the rapid growth of the 
national debt in modern times. In 1853 the total public debt, 
internal and external, amounted to £2,082,680. It exceeded 
£90,000,000 in 1800, and in 1891-1892 the finances of the kingdom 
reached a crisis.from which there was no escape except by arrang- 
ing for a reduction in the amount payable as interest (see History, 
below). By the law of the 26th of February 1892 30% was de- 
ducted from the internal debt payable in currency; by the law of 
the 20th of April 189366!% was deducted from the interest on 
the external debt, due in gold. A law of the oth of August 1902 
provided for the conversion of certain gold debts into three 
series of consolidated debt, at reduced interest. In 1909 the total 
outstanding debt amounted to £161,837,430, made up as 
follows: new external 3% converted in three series, £34,223,^65; 
A\% tobacco loan £7,267,480; internal 3% (quoted in London) 
£113,132,979. Internal debt at 3, 4 and 4J% was also outstanding 
to the amount of £7,213,506. 

Constitution, — Up to October 19 10 the government was an 
hereditary and constitutional monarchy, based on the constitu- 
tional charter which was granted hy King Pedro IV. on the 29th of 
April 1826, and was afterwards several times modified; the most 
important changes were those effected by the acts of the 5th of 
July 1852, the 24th of July 1885, and the 28th of March and 25th 
of September 1895. The revolution of the 5th of October 1910 
hrought the monarchy to an end and substituted republican 
government for it. The monarchical constitution recognized four 
powers in the state — the executive, moderating, legislative and 
judicial. The two first of these were vested in the sovereign, who 
might be a woman, and who shared the legislative power with 
two chambers, the Camara dos Pares or House of Peers, and 
the Camara dos Depulados or House of Commons; these were 
collectively styled the Corles Geraes, or more briefly the Cortes, 
The royal veto could not be imposed on legislation passed 
twice by both houses. The annual session lasted four months, 
and a general election was necessary at the end of every four 
years, or immediately after a dissolution. A committee repre- 
senting both houses adjudicated upon all cases • of conflict 
between Peers and Commons; should it fail to reach a decision, 
the dispute was referred to the sovereign, whose award was 
final. Up to 1885 some members sat in the House of Peers by 
hereditary right, while others were nominated for life. It was 
then decided that such rights should cease, except in the case 
of princes of royal blood and members then sitting, and that 



when all the hereditary peerages had lapsed the house should 
be composed of the princes of the royal blood, the archbishops 
and bishops of the continental dioceses, a hundred legislative 
peers appointed by the king for life, and fifty elected every new 
parliament hy the Commons. In 1895 the number of nominated 
life peers was reduced to ninety and the elective branch was 
abolished. Subject to certain limitations and to a property 
qualification, any person over 40 years of age was eligible 
to a peerage. The titles and social position of the Portuguese 
aristocracy were not affected when its political privileges were 
abolished. In the nomination of life peers, and in certain 
administrative matters the sovereign was advised by a council of 
state, whose twelve members were nominated for life and were 
principally past or present ministers. The sovereign exercised 
his executive power through a cabinet which was responsible lo 
the cortes, and consisted of seven members, representing the 
ministries of (1) the interior, (2) foreign affairs, (3) finance, 
(4) justice and worship, (5) war, (6) marine and colonies, (7) 
public works, industry and commerce. The House of Commons 
was composed of 148 members, representing the 26 electoral 
divisions of Portugal, the Azores and Madeira, which returned 
113 elected members and 35 representatives of minorities, and 
of 7 members representing the colonies. Peers, naturalized 
foreigners and certain employees of the state were unable to sit in 
the House of Commons; members were required to be graduates 
of one of the highest, secondary or professional schools, or to 
possess an income of not less than 400 milreis (£88). All 
members might, in connexion with their official duties, travel free 
on railways and ships owned by the state; but since 1892 none 
had received any salary except the colonial members, who were 
paid 100 milreis (£22) per month during the session, and 50 
milreis (£11) per month during the remainder of the year. All 
male cjtizens 21 years old who could read and write, or who paid 
taxes amounting to 500 reis yearly, had the parliamentary 
franchise, except convicts, heggars, undischarged bankrupts, 
domestic servants, workmen permanently employed by the state 
and soldiers or sailors below the rank of commissioned officer. 
(For changes made under republican rule, see History, § 8.) 

Local Government. — Continental Portugal was formerly divided 
for administrative purposes into six provinces which corresponded 
to a great extent with the natural geographical divisions of the 
country and are described in separate articles; the names of these, 
which are still commonly used, are Entre-Minho-e-Douro (also 
called Entre-Douro-e-Minho or Minho), Traz-os-Montes, Beira, 
Estremadura, Alemtejo and Algarve. The province of Douro, 
another administrative division of less antiquity, comprised the 
present districts of Aveiro and Oporto, or part of Beira and Entrc- 
Minho-e- Douro. The six ancient provinces were subdivided on 
the 28th of June 1833 into districts, each named after its chief 
town, as follows: Entre-Minho-e-Douro into Vianna do Castello, 
Braga, Oporto; Traz-os-Montes, into Villa Real, Braganza; Beira, 
into Aveiro, Vizeu, Coimbra, Guarda, Castello Branco; Estremadura, 
into Leiria, Santarem, Lisbon; Alemtejo, into Portalegre, Evora, 
Beja; Algarve was renamed Faro. In 1910 the Azores comprised three 
districts and Madeira formed one. Each district was governed by a 
commission composed of (1) the civil governor, who was nominated 
by the^ central authority and presided over the commission; (2) the 
administrative auditor; and (3) three members chosen by indirect 
suffrage. The districts were divided into communes (concelkos), 
each administered by an elected council, and a mayor nominated 
by the central authority. The mayor could not preside over the 
council, which appointed one of its own members to preside and to 
give effect to its decisions. The communes were subdivided into 
parishes (freguesias), which were administered by the elected council 
(junta de parochia) over which the parish priest (presbitero) pre- 
sided, and by the regedor } an official who represented the mayor of 
the commune and was nominated by the civil governor. The central 
authority had almost complete control over local administration 
through its representatives, the civil governor, mayors and regedores. 

Justice, — In 1910 Portugal was divided into 193 judicial districts 
(comarcas), in each of which there was a court of first instance. The 
three courts of appeal (tribunaes de relacao) sat at Lisbon, Oporto and 
Ponta Delgada (Azores), and there was a Supreme Court in Lisbon. 

Colonies, — At the beginning of the 19th century Portugal 
possessed a larger colonial empire than any European power 
except Great Britain and Spain. At the beginning of the 20th 
century its transmarine possessions had heen greatly reduced in 
size hy the loss of Brazil, but were still only surpassed in extent

by those of three powers— Great Britain, France and Germany. 
Their total area was about 803,000 sq. m., of which 794,ooo sq. m. 
are in Africa. They comprised, in Africa, the Cape Verde 
Islands, St Thomas and Prince's Islands, Portuguese Guinea, 
Angola and Portuguese East Africa, or Mozambique; in India, 
Goa, Damaun and Diu; in China, Macao; and in the Malay 
Archipelago part of Timor. All these are described in separate 
articles. In all the white population is in a minority; in most 
the climate is unsuitable for European colonization, nor is the 
commercial value of the colonics commensurate with their 
extent. Viewed as a whole, Portuguese administration has been 
carried on under difficulties which have rendered it costly and 
inefficient, the home government being compelled to contribute 
a large annual subsidy towards its maintenance. The amount 
paid in subsidies from 1870 to 1900 was about £15,000,000. 

Religion. — Roman Catholicism was the state religion until 1910, 
but other creeds were tolerated, and the Church lost its temporal 
authority in 1834, when the monasteries were suppressed and their 
property confiscated for the first time. There are three ecclesiastical 
provinces — Braga, Lisbon and Evora, each under an archbishop. 
The archbishop of Braga, whose see is the most ancient, has the 
title of Primate; the archbishop of Lisbon has the honorary title of 
Patriarch, and is usually elected a cardinal. His province includes 
Madeira, the Azores and the West African colonies. There are four- 
teen dioceses, of which Oporto is the most important. The annual 
revenues of the upper hierarchy of the Church amounted, up to 1910, 
to about £65,000. In some of the larger towns the foreign residents 
have their own places of worship. (Sec further under history.) 

Education. — Primary education is regulated by a law of 1844, 
under which children between the ages^ of 7 and 15 arc bound to 
attend a school, should there be one within a mile, under penalty 
to the parents of a fine and deprivation of civil rights. This law 
has not been strictly enforced; primary education was never 
properly organized; and, according to census returns, the pro- 
portion of the population (including children) unable to read was 
82-4% in 1878, 79-2 in 1890 and 78-6 in 1900. There were in 1910 
5250 public and 1750 private primary schools. In the chief towns 
there are training schools for teachers. The system of secondary 
education was reorganized in 1894. In 1905 there were state 
lyceums in each district capital and in Guimaraes, Lamcgo and 
Amarante;5 municipal lyceums, at Cclorico de Basto, Chaves, 
Ponte de Lima, Povoa de Varzimand Setubal; military and naval 
colleges; a secondary school for girls in Lisbon; numerous private 
secondary schools and ecclesiastical seminaries; industrial, com- 
mercial and technical schools; and pilot schools at Lisbon, Oporto, 
Faro and Ponta Delgada (Azores). Other important educational 
institutions are described under LisnoN and Oporto. The national 
university is at Coimbra (q.v.). 

Defence. — Under the monarchy, the army was maintained at its 
normal strength partly by voluntary enlistment and conscription, 
the chief law regulating it being that of 1887, as variously modified 
in subsequent years. The cortes fixed the number of conscripts to 
be enrolled in each year: in 1905, 15,000 men for the army, 1000 
for the navy, 500 for the municipal guards and 400 for the fiscal 
guards. The organization of the army was based on the acts of the 
7th of September 1899 and the 24th of December 1901. With cer- 
tain exceptions all men over 21 years of age were liable for service — 
3 years in the regular army, 5 years in the first reserve and 7 years 
in the second reserve; but exemption could always be purchased. 
In time of war, the municipal guards, numbering about 2200, and 
the fiscal guards, numbering about 5200, might be incorporated in 
the army. The total effective force of the active army on a peace 
footing was 1787 officers, 31,281 men, 6479 horses and mules and 100 
guns. The total effective force on a war footing, inclusive of re- 
servists, municipal guards and fiscal guards, was 4221 officers, 178,603 
men, 19,600 horses and mules and 336 guns. Lisbon, Elyas and 
Angra in the Azores, were considered first-class fortresses, but only 
Lisbon had modern defences. The Portuguese navy in 1910 con- 
sisted of 1 armoured vessel, 5 protected cruisers, 2 third-class 
cruisers, 19 gunboats, 1 torpedo gunboat, 4 torpedo boats, 16 
nver gunboats, 4 transports and 3 training ships. Twelve other 
vessels, including 2 submarines, were under construction. The 
whole fleet was manned by about 5000 men.

History 

Throughout the centuries which witnessed the destruction 
of Carthaginian power by Rome, the establishment and decline 
of Latin civilization, the invasion by Alani,; Suevi and other 
barbarian races, the resettlement under Visigothic rule and the 
overthrow of the Visigoths by Arab and Berber tribes from 
Africa, Portugal remained an undifferentiated part of Hispania, 
without sign of national consciousness. The Iberian Peninsula 
was one: and its common history is related under Spain. It is 
true that some Portuguese writers have sought to identify 
their race with the ancient Lusitani, and have claimed for it a 
separate and continuous existence dating from -the 2nd century 
B.C. The revolt of Lusitania against the Romans has been 
regarded as an early manifestation of Portuguese love of liberty, 
Viriathus as a national hero. But this theory, which originated 
in the 15th century and was perpetuated in the title of The 
LusiadSy has no historical foundation. In 1095 Portugal was an 
obscure border fief of the kingdom of Leon. Its territories, far 
from the centres of European civilization and consisting largely 
of mountain, moorland and forest, were bounded on the north 
by the Minho, on the south by the Mondego. Its name (Porlu- 
calia, Terra portucalensis) was derived from the little seaport of 
Port us Cale or Villa Nova de Gaia, now a suburb of Oporto, at 
the mouth of the Douro. Its inhabitants, surrounded by 
Moorish or Spanish enemies and distracted by civil war, derived 
such rudiments of civilization as they possessed from Arabic or 
Leonese sources. But from these obscure beginnings Portugal 
rose in four centuries to be the greatest maritime, commercial 
and colonial power in Europe. 

The history of the nation comprises eight periods. (1) Be- 
tween 1095 and 1279 a Portuguese kingdom was established and 
extended until it reached its present continental limits. (2) 
Between 1279 and 141 5 the monarchy was gradually consolidated 
in spite of resistance from the Church, the nobles and the rival 
kingdom of Castile. (3) In 14 15 began a period of crusades and 
discoveries, culminating in the discovery of an ocean-route to 
India (1497-1499). (4) From 1499 to 1580 Portugal acquired 
an empire stretching from Brazil eastward to the Moluccas, 
reached the zenith of its prosperity and entered upon a period 
of swift decline. (5) Spanish kings ruled over Portugal from 
1581 to 1640. (6) The chief event of the years 1640 to 1755 was 
the restoration of the Portuguese monarchy. (7) Between 1755 
and 1826 the reforms of Pombal and the Peninsular War prepared 
the country for a change from absolutism to constitutional 
monarchy. (8) In 1826 the era of constitutional government 
began. 

1. The Establishment of the Monarchy. — The origin of Portugal, 
as a separate state, was an incident in the Christian reconquest 
of Spain. Towards the close of the nth century 
crusading knights came from every part of Europe ^."0%. 
to aid the kings of northern and central Spain in 
driving out the Moors. Among these adventurers was Count 
Henry of Burgundy, an ambitious warrior who, in 1005, married 
Theresa, natural daughter of Alphonso VI., king of Leon. The 
county of Portugal, which had already been won back from the 
Moors (1055-1064), was included in Theresa's dowry. Count 
Henry ruled as a vassal of Alphonso VI., whose Galician marches 
were thus secured against any sudden Moorish raid. But in

[HISTORY 



1 109 Alphonso VI. died, bequeathing all his territories to his 
legitimate daughter Urraca, and Count Henry at once invaded 
Leon, hoping to add to his own dominions at the expense of his 
suzerain. After three years of war against Urraca and other 
rival claimants to the throne of Leon, Count Henry himself died 
in 1112. He left Theresa to govern Portugal north of the 
Mondego during the minority of her infant son AfTonso Henriques 
(Alphonso I.): south of the Mondego the Moors were still 
supreme. 

Theresa renewed the struggle against her half-sister and 
suzerain Urraca in 1116-1117, and again in 1120; in 1121 she 

was besieged in Lanhoso and captured. But a 
1112*128* P eace was negotiated by the archbishops Diogo 

Gelmires of Santiago de Compostela and Burdino of 
Braga, rival churchmen whose wealth and military resources 
enabled them to dictate terms. Bitter jealousy existed between 
the two prelates, each claiming to be primate of " all the Spains," 
and their antagonism had some historical importance in so far 
as it fostered the growth of separatist tendencies among the 
Portuguese. But the quarrel was temporarily suspended 
because both Gelmires and Burdino had reason to dread the 
extension of Urraca's authority. It was arranged that Theresa 
should be liberated and should continue to hold the county of 
Portugal as a fief (honor) of Leon. During the next five years 
she lavished wealth and titles upon her lover Fernando Peres, 
count of Trava, thus estranging her son, the archbishop of Braga 
and the nobles, most of whom were foreign crusaders. In 11 28, 
after her power had been crushed in another unsuccessful conflict 
with Leon and Castile, she was deposed by her own rebellious 
subjects and exiled in company with Peres. She died in 1130. 

Alphonso, who became count of Portugal in 1128, was one of 
the warrior heroes of medieval romance; his exploits were sung 
by troubadours throughout south-western Europe, and even in 
Africa " ibn Errik " — the son of Henry — was known and 

feared. The annals of his reign have been encum- 
1128-1185* "bered with a mass of legends, among which must be 

included the account of a cortes held at Lamego in 
1143; probably also the description of the Valdevez tournament, 
in which the Portuguese knights are said to have vanquished the 
champions of Leon and Castile. Alphonso was occupied in 
almost incessant border fighting against his Christian or Moorish 
neighbours. Twelve years of campaigning on the Galician 
frontier were concluded in 1143 by the peace of Zamora, in which 
Alphonso was recognized as independent of any Spanish sover- 
eign, although he promised to be a faithful vassal of the pope 
and to pay him a yearly tribute of four ounces of gold. In 1167, 
however, the war was renewed. Alphonso succeeded in con- 
quering part of Galicia,but in attempting to capture the frontier 
fortress of Badajoz he was wounded and forced to surrender to 
Ferdinand II. of Leon (1169). Ferdinand was his son-in-law, 
and was probably disposed to leniency by the imminence of a 
Moorish invasion in which Portugal could render useful assistance. 
Alphonso was therefore released under promise to abandon all 
his conquests in Galicia. 

He had already won many victories over the Moors. At 
the beginning of his reign the religious fervour which had 
sustained the Almoravide dynasty was rapidly subsiding; in 
Portugal independent Moorish chiefs ruled over cities and petty 
states, ignoring the central government; in Africa the Almohades 
were destroying the remnants of the Almoravide power. 
Alphonso took advantage of these dissensions to invade Alemtejo, 
reinforced by the Templars and Hospitallers, whose respective 
headquarters were at Soure and Thomar. On the 25th of July 
1 139 he defeated the combined forces of the Moors on the plains 
of Ourique, in Alemtejo. Legend has magnified the victory 
into the rout of 200,000 Moslems under five kings; but so far was 
the battle from being decisive that in 1140 the Moors were able 
to seize the fortress of Leiria, built by Alphonso in 1135 as an 
outpost for the defence of Coimbra, his capital. In 1144 they 
defeated the Templars at Soure. But on the 15th of March 
1 147 Alphonso stormed the fortress of Santarem, and about the 
same time a band of crusaders on their way to Palestine landed 



at Oporto and volunteered for the impending siege of Lisbon. 
Among them were many Englishmen, Germans and Flemings, 
who were afterwards induced to settle in Portugal. Aided by 
these powerful allies, Alphonso captured Lisbon on the 24th of 
October 1147. This was the greatest military achievement of 
his reign. The Moorish garrisons of Palmella, Cintra and Almada 
soon capitulated, and in 11 58 Alcacer do Sal, one of the chief 
centres of Moorish commerce, was taken by storm. At this 
time, however, the Almohades had triumphed in Africa and 
invaded the Peninsula, where they were able to check the 
Portuguese reconquest, although isolated bands of crusading 
adventurers succeeded in establishing themselves in various 
cities of Alemtejo. The most famous of these free-lances was 
Giraldo Sempavor (" Gerald the Fearless "), who captured 
Evora in 11 66. In 11 71 Alphonso concluded a seven years' 
truce with the Moors; weakened by his wound and by old age, he 
could no longer take the field, and when the war broke out afresh 
he delegated the chief command to his son Sancho. Between 
1179 and 1184 the Moors retrieved many, of their losses in Alem- 
tejo, but were unable to retake Santarem and Lisbon. Alphonso 
died on the 6th of December 1185. He had secured for Portugal 
the status though not the name of an independent kingdom, and 
had extended its frontier southwards from the Mondego to the 
Tagus. He had laid the foundation of its navy and had strength- 
ened, if he did not inaugurate, that system of co-operation 
between the Crown and the military orders which afterwards 
proved of incalculable service in the maritime and colonial 
development of the nation'. 

Sancho I. continued the war against the Moors with varying 
fortune. In 11 89 he won Silves, then the capital of Algarve; 
in 1 192 he lost not only Algarve but the greater part 
of Alemtejo, including Alcacer do Sal. A peace was u^^iu 
then arranged, and for the next eight years Sancho 
was engaged in hostilities against Alphonso IX. of Leon. The 
motives and course of this indecisive struggle are equally 
obscure. It ended in 1201, and the last decade of Sancho's 
reign was a period of peaceful reform which earned for the king 
his popular name of Povoador, the " maker of towns." He 
granted fresh charters to many cities, legalizing the system of 
self-government which the Romans had bequeathed to the 
Visigoths and the Moors had retained or improved. Lisbon had 
already (11 79) received a charter from Alphonso I. Sancho also 
endeavoured to foster immigration and agriculture, by granting 
estates to the military orders and municipalities on condition 
that the occupiers should cultivate or colonize their lands. 
Towards the close of his reign he became embroiled in a dispute 
with Pope Innocent III. He bad insisted that priests should 
accompany their flocks in battle, had made them amenable to 
secular jurisdiction, had withheld the tribute due to Rome and 
had even claimed the right of disposing of ecclesiastical domains. 
Finally he had quarrelled with Martinho Rodrigues, the unpopu- 
lar bishop of Oporto, who was besieged for five months in his 
palace and then forced to seek redress in Rome (1209). As 
Sancho was in weak health and had no means of resisting Papal 
pressure, he made full submission (12 10); and after bestowing 
large estates on his sons and daughters, he retired into the monas- 
tery of Alcobaca (g.v.), where he died in 1211. 

The reign of Alphonso II. (" the Fat ") is noteworthy for 
the first meeting of the Portuguese cortes, to which the upper 
hierarchy of the Church and the nobles (fidalgos and Alphonso 
ricos homens) were summoned by royal writ. The H.,i2tt- 
king was no warrior, but in 1212 a Portuguese con- t223 * 
tingent aided the Castilians to defeat the Moors at Las Navas 
de Tolosa, and in 1217 the ministers, bishops and captains of 
the realm, reinforced by foreign crusaders, retook Alcacer do Sal. 
Alfonso II. repudiated the will of his father, refused to surren- 
der the estates left to his brothers, who went into exile, and only 
gave up the property bequeathed to his sisters after a prolonged 
civil war in which Alphonso IX. of Leon took part against them. 
Even then he compelled the heiresses to take the veil. His 
attempts to strengthen the monarchy and fill the treasury at 
the expense of the Church resulted in his excommunication by

Pope Honorius III., and Portugal remained under interdict until 
Alphonso II. died in 1223. 

Sancho II. succeeded at the age of thirteen. To secure the 
removal of the interdict the leading statesmen who were identified 
with the policy of his father — Goncalo Mendes the 
^223-uis! chancellor, Pedro Annes the lord chamberlain 
(mordomo-mdr) and Vicente, dean of Lisbon — 
resigned their offices. Estevao Soares, archbishop of Braga, 
placed himself at the head of the nobles and churchmen who 
threatened to usurp the royal power during Sancho II. 's minority, 
and negotiated an alliance with Alphonso IX., by which it was 
arranged that the Portuguese should attack Elvas, the Spaniards 
Badajoz. Elvas was taken from the Moors in 1226, and in 1227 
Sancho assumed control of the kingdom. He reinstated Pedro 
Annes, made Vicente chancellor, and appointed Martim Annes 
chief standard-bearer {alferes mdr). He continued the crusade 
against the Moors, who were driven from their last strongholds 
in Alcmtejo, and in 1 230-1 244, after a dispute with Rome 
which was once more ended by the imposition of an interdict 
and the submission of the Portuguese ruler, he won many 
successes in the Algarve. But his career of conquest was cut 
short by a revolution (1245), for which his marriage to a Castilian 
lady, D. Mecia Lopez de Haro, furnished a pretext. The legiti- 
macy of the union has been questioned, on grounds which appear 
insufficient; but of its unpopularity there can be no doubt. 
The bishops, resenting the favour shown by Sancho to his father's 
anti-clerical ministers, took advantage of this unpopularity to 
organize the rebellion. They found a leader in Sancho's brother 
Alphonso, count of Boulogne, who owed his title to a marriage 
with Matilda, countess of Boulogne. The pope issued a bull of 
deposition in favour of Alphonso, who reached Lisbon in 1246; 
and after a civil war lasting two years Sancho H. retired to 
Toledo, where he died in January 1248. 

One of the first acts of the usurper, and one of the most 
important, was to abandon the semi-ecclesiastical titles of visitor 
Alphonso (visitador) or defender (curador) of the realm, and to 
w. t 1248- proclaim himself king (ret). Hitherto the position 
** 7P * of the monarchy had been precarious; as in Aragon 

the nobles and the church had exercised a large measure of con- 
trol over their nominal head, and though it would be pedantry 
to over-emphasize the importance of the royal title, its assump- 
tion by Alphonso III. does mark a definite stage in the evolution 
of a national monarchy and a centralized government. A 
second stage was reached shortly afterwards by the conquest 
of Algarve, the last remaining stronghold of the Moors. This 
drew down upon Portugal the anger of Alphonso X. of Leon 
and Castile, surnamed the Wise, who claimed suzerainty over 
Algarve. The war which followed was ended by Alphonso III. 
consenting to wed Donna Beatriz de Guzman, illegitimate 
daughter of Alphonso X., and to hold Algarve as a fief of Castile. 
The celebration of this marriage, while Matilda, countess of 
Boulogne and first wife of Alphonso III., was still alive, entailed 
the imposition of an interdict upon the kingdom. In 1254 
Alphonso III. summoned a cortes at Leiria, in which the chief 
cities were represented, as well as the nobles and clergy. Forti- 
fied by their support the king refused to submit to Rome. At 
the cortes of Coimbra (1261), he further strengthened his position 
by conciliating the representatives of the cities, who denounced 
the issue of a debased coinage, and by recognizing that taxation 
could not be imposed without consent of the cortes. The clergy 
suffered more than the laity under a prolonged interdict, and in 
1262 Pope Urban VI. legalized the disputed marriage and 
legitimized Dom Diniz, the king's eldest son. Thus ended the con- 
test for supremacy between Church and Crown. The monarchy 
owed its triumph to its championship of national interests, to 
the support of the municipalities and military orders, and to the 
prestige gained by the royal armies in the Moorish and Castilian 
wars. In 1263 Alphonso X. renounced his claim to suzerainty 
over Algarve, and thus the kingdom of Portugal simultaneously 
reached \ts present European limits and attained its complete 
independence. Lisbon was henceforth recognized as the capital. 
Alphonso III. continued to reign until his death in 1279, but the 



peace of his later years was broken by the rebellion (1277-1270) 
of D. Diniz, 1 the heir-apparent. 

2. The Consolidation of the Monarchy: 1270-1415. — The 
chief problems now confronting the monarchy were no longer 
military, but social, economic and constitutional. It is true 
that the reign of Diniz was not a period of uninterrupted peace. 
At the outset his legitimacy was disputed by his brother 
Alphonso, and a brief civil war ensued. Hostilities between 
Portugal and the reunited kingdoms of Leon and Castile were 
terminated in 1297 by a treaty of alliance, in accordance with 
which Ferdinand IV. of Leon and Castile married Constance, 
daughter of Diniz, while Alphonso, son of Diniz, married Beatrice 
of Castile, daughter of Ferdinand. A further outbreak of civil 
war, between the king and the heir-apparent, was averted in 
1 293 by the queen-consort Isabella of Portugal, who had married 
Diniz in 1281, and was canonized for her many virtues in the 
1 6th century. She rode between the hostile camps, and 
succeeded in arranging an honourable peace between her 
husband and her son. 

These wars were too brief to interfere seriously with the 
social reconstruction to which the king devoted himself. At 
his accession the Portuguese people was far from 
homogeneous; it would be long before its component i2°g^i32S. 
races — Moors and Mozarabs of the south, Galicians 
of the north, Jews and foreign crusaders — could be fused into 
one nationality. There were also urgent economic problems 
to be solved. The Moors had made Alemtejo the granary of 
Portugal, but war had undone their work, and large tracts of 
land were now barren and depopulated. Commerce and educa- 
tion had similarly been subordinated to the struggle for national 
existence. The machinery of administration was out of date 
and complicated by the authority of feudal and ecclesiastical 
courts. The supremacy of the Crown, though recognized, was 
still unstable. It was Diniz who initiated the needful reforms. 
He earned his title of the reilavrador or "farmer king "by intro- 
ducing improved methods of cultivation and founding agricul- 
tural schools. He encouraged maritime trade by negotiating 
a commercial treaty with England (1294) and forming a royal 
navy (13 17) under the command of a Genoese admiral named 
Emmanuele di Pezagna (Manoel Pessanha). In 1200 he founded 
the university of Coimbra (q.v.). He was a poet and a patron 
of literature and music (see Literature^ below). His chief 
administrative reforms were designed to secure centralized 
government and to limit the jurisdiction of feudal courts. He 
encouraged and nationalized the military orders. In 1290 the 
Portuguese knights of Sao Thiago (Santiago) were definitely 
separated from the parent Spanish order. The orders of Crato 
and of St Benedict of Aviz had already been established, the 
traditional dates of their incorporation being 1113 and 1162. 
After the condemnation of the Templars by Pope Clement V. 
(1312) an ecclesiastical commission investigated the charges 
against the Portuguese branch of the order, and found in its 
favour. As the Templars were rich, influential and loyal, 
Diniz took advantage of the death of Clement V, to maintain 
the order under a new name; the Order of Christ, as it was 
henceforth called, received the benediction of the pope in 13 19 
and subsequently played an important part in the colonial 
expansion of Portugal. 

Alphonso IV. adhered to the matrimonial policy initiated 
by Diniz. He arranged that his daughter Maria should wed 
Alphonso XI. of Castile (r328), but the marriage Atphoaso 
precipitated the war it was intended to avert, and /v., 1325- 
peace was only restored (1330) after Queen Isabella i3S7 * 
had again intervened. Pedro, the crown prince, afterwards 
married Constance, daughter of the duke of Penafiel (near 
Valladolid), and Alphonso IV. brought a strong Portuguese 
army to aid the Castilians against the Moors of Granada and their 
African allies. In the victory won by the Christians on the banks 
of the river Salado, near Tarifa, he earned his title of Alphonso 
the Brave (1340). In 134 £ he married his daughter Leonora

(Lenor) to Pedro IV. of Aragon. The later years of his reign 
were darkened by the tragedy of Inez de Castro (q.v.). He died 
in 1357, and the first act of his successor, Pedro the Severe, 
Pedro r. was t0 *^e ven S eance on the murderers of Inez. 
1357-1367. Throughout his reign he strengthened the central 
government at the expense of the aristocracy and 
the Church, by a stern enforcement of law and order. In 1361, 
at the cortes of Elvas, it was enacted that the privileges of the 
clergy should only be deemed valid in so far as they did not 
conflict with the royal prerogative. Pedro maintained friendly 
relations with England, where in 1352 Edward III. issued a 
proclamation in favour of Portuguese traders, and in 1353 the 
Portuguese envoy Affonso Martins Alho signed a covenant with 
the merchants of London, guaranteeing mutual good faith in all 
commercial dealings. 

The foreign policy of Diniz, Alphonso IV. and Pedro I. had 
been, as a rule, successful in its main object, the preservation 
of peace with the Christian kingdoms of Spain; in consequence, 
the Portuguese had advanced in prosperity and culture. They 
had supported the monarchy because it was a national institu- 
tion, hostile to the tyranny of nobles and clergy. During the 
reign of Ferdinand (1 367-1 383) and under the regency of Leonora 
the ruling dynasty ceased to represent the national will; the 
Portuguese people therefore made an end of the dynasty and 
chose its own ruler. The complex events which brought about 
this crisis may be briefly summarized. 

Ferdinand, a weak but ambitious and unscrupulous king, 
claimed the thrones of Castile and Leon, left vacant by the 
Ferdinand death of Pedro I. of Castile (1369); he based his 
and Leonora, claim on the fact that his grandmother Beatrice 
1367-1385. belonged to the legitimate line of Castile. When 
the majority of the Castilian nobles refused to accept a 
Portuguese sovereign, and welcomed Henry of Trastamara 
(see Spain: History), as Henry II. of Castile, Ferdinand allied 
himself with the Moors and Aragonese; but in 137 1 Pope Gregory 
XL intervened, and it was decided that Ferdinand should 
renounce his claim and marry Leonora, the daughter of his 
successful rival. Ferdinand, however, preferred his Portuguese 
mistress, Leonora Telles de Menezes, whom he eventually 
married. To avenge this slight, Henry of Castile invaded 
Portugal and besieged Lisbon. Ferdinand appealed to John 
of Gaunt, who also claimed the throne of Castile, on behalf of 
his wife Constance, daughter of Pedro I. of Castile. An alliance 
between Portugal and England was concluded; and although 
Ferdinand made peace with Castile in 1374, he renewed his 
claim in 1380, after the death of Henry of Castile, and sent Joao 
Fernandes Andeiro, count of Ourem, to secure English aid. 
In 138 1 Richard II. of England despatched a powerful force to 
Lisbon, and betrothed his cousin Prince Edward to Beatrice, only 
child of Ferdinand, who had been recognized as heiress to the 
throne by the cortes of Leiria (1376). In 1383, however, 
Ferdinand made peace with John I. of Castile at Salvaterra, 
deserting his English allies, who retaliated by ravaging part of 
his territory. By the treaty of Salvaterra it was agreed that 
Beatrice should marry John I. Six months later Ferdinand 
died, and in accordance with the terms of the treaty Leonora 
became regent until .the eldest son of John I. and Beatrice should 
be of age. 

Leonora had long carried on an intrigue with the count of 
Ourem, whose influence was resented by the leaders of the 
The aristocracy, while her tyrannical rule also aroused 

Rebellion of bitter opposition. The malcontents chose D.John, 
1383. grand-master of the knights of Aviz and illegitimate 

son of Pedro the Severe, as their leader, organized a revolt 
in Lisbon, and assassinated the count of Ourem within the 
royal palace (Dec. 6, 1383). Leonora fled to Santarem and 
summoned aid from Castile, while D. John was proclaimed 
defender of Portugal. In 1384 a Castilian army invested Lisbon, 
but encountered a heroic resistance, and after five months an 
outbreak of plague compelled them* to raise the siege. John I. 
of Castile, discovering or alleging that Leonora had plotted to 
poison him, imprisoned her in a convent at Tordesillas, where 



she died in 1386. Before this, Nuno Alvares Pereira, con- 
stable of Portugal, had gained his popular title of "The Holy 
Constable " by twice defeating the invaders, at Atoleiro and 
Trancoso in the district of Guarda. 

On the 1 6th of April 1385 the cortes assembled at Coimbra 
declared the crown of Portugal elective, and at the instance of 
Joao das Regras, the chancellor, D. John was 
chosen king. No event in the early constitutional ?*f* e ? o/ 
history of Portugal is more important than this 
election, which definitely affirmed the national character of 
the monarchy. The choice of the grand-master of Aviz ratified 
the old alliance between the Crown and the military orders; 
his election by the whole cortes not only ratified the alliance 
between the Crown and the commons, but also included the 
nobles and the Church. The nation was unanimous. 

Ferdinand had been the last legitimate descendant of (jjount 
Henry of Burgundy. With John I. began the rule of a new 
dynasty, the House of Aviz. The most urgent . hnl 
matter which confronted the king — or the group is85-M33. 
of statesmen, led by Joao das Regras and the 
" Holy Constable " who inspired his policy — was the menace of 
Castilian aggression. But on the 14th of August 1385 the Por- 
tuguese army, aided by 500 English archers, utterly defeated 
the Castilians at Aljubarrota. By this victory the Portuguese 
showed themselves equal in military power to their strongest 
rivals in the Peninsula. In October the " Holy Constable " 
won another victory at Valverde; early in 1386 5000 English 
soldiers, under John of Gaunt, reinforced the Portuguese; and 
by the treaty of Windsor (May 9, 1386), the alliance between 
Portugal and England was confirmed and extended. Against 
such a combination the Castilians were powerless; a truce 
was arranged in 1387 and renewed at intervals until 141 1, 
when peace was concluded. D. Diniz, eldest son of Inez de 
Castro, claimed the throne and invaded Portugal in 1398, 
but his supporters were easily crushed. The domestic and 
foreign policy pursued by John I. until his death in 1433 may 
be briefly described. At home he endeavoured to reform 
administration, to encourage agriculture and commerce, and 
to secure the loyalty of the nobles by grants of land and . 
privileges so extensive that, towards the end of his reign, many 
nobles who exercised their full feudal rights had become 
almost independent princes. Abroad, he aimed at peace with 
Castile and close friendship with England. In 1387 he had 
married Philippa of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt; 
Richard II. sent troops to aid in the expulsion of D. Diniz; 
Henry IV., Henry V. and Henry VI. of England successively 
ratified the treaty of Windsor; Henry IV. made his ally a knight 
of the Garter in 1400. The convent of Batalha (q.v.) t founded 
to commemorate the victory of Aljubarrota, is architecturally 
a monument of the English influence prevalent at this time 
throughout Portugal. 

The cortes of Coimbra, the battle of Aljubarrota and the 
treaty of Windsor mark the three final stages in the consoli- 
dation of the monarchy. A period of expansion oversea began 
in the same reign, with the capture of Ceuta in Morocco. The 
three eldest sons of King John and Queen Philippa — Edward, 
Pedro and Henry, afterwards celebrated as Prince Henry the 
Navigator — desired to win knighthood by service against the 
Moors, the historic enemies of their country and creed. In 
141 5 a Portuguese fleet, commanded by the king and the three 
princes, set sail for Ceuta. English men-at-arms were sent 
by Henry V. to take part in the expedition, which proved suc- 
cessful. The town was captured and garrisoned, and thus the 
first Portuguese outpost was established on the mainland of 
Africa. 

3. The Period of Discoveries:* 141 5- 1499. — Before describing 
in outline the course of the discoveries which were soon to render 
Portugal the foremost colonizing power in Europe it is necessary 
to indicate the main causes which contributed to that result. 
As the south-westernmost of the free peoples of Etfrope, the 
Portuguese were the natural inheritors of that work of ex- 
ploration which had been carried on during the middle ages f

chiefly by the Arabs. They began where the Arabs left off, 
by penetrating far into the Atlantic. The long littoral of their 
country, with its fine harbours and rivers flowing westward to 
the ocean, had been the training-ground of a race of adven- 
turous seamen. It was impossible, moreover, to expand or 
reach new markets except by sea: the interposition of Castile 
and Aragon, so often hostile, completely prevented any 
intercourse by land between Portugal and other European 
countries. Consequently the Portuguese merchants sent their 
goods by sea to England, Flanders, or the Hansc towns. The 
whole history of the nation had also inspired a desire for fresh 
conquests among its leaders. Portugal had won and now held 
its independence by the sword. The long struggle to expel the 
Moors, with the influence of foreign Crusaders and the military 
orders, had given a religious sanction to the desire for martial 
fame. Nowhere was the ancient crusading spirit so active a 
political force. To make war upon Islam seemed to the Portu- 
guese their natural destiny and their duty as Christians. 

It was the genius of Prince Henry the Navigator (q.v.) that 
co-ordinated and utilized all these tendencies towards ex- 
Prince pansion. Prince Henry placed at, the disposal of 
Henry the his captains the vast resources of the Order of 
Navigator. q\^ s ^ the best information and the most accurate 
instruments and maps whicji could be obtained. He 
sought to effect a junction with the half -fabulous Christian 
Empire of " Prester John " by way of the " Western Nile," 
i.e. the Senegal, and, in alliance with that potentate, to crush 
the Turks and liberate Palestine. The conception of an ocean 
route to India appears to have originated after his death. On 
land he again defeated the Moors, who attempted to re-take 
Ceuta in 1418; but in an expedition to Tangier, undertaken 
in 1436 by King Edward (1433-1438), the Portuguese army was 
defeated, and could only escape destruction by surrendering 
as a hostage Prince Ferdinand, the king's youngest brother. 
Ferdinand, known as " the Constant," from the fortitude with 
which he endured captivity, died unransomed in 1443. By 
sea Prince Henry's captains continued their exploration of 
Africa and the Atlantic. In 1433 Cape Bojador was doubled; in 
1434 the first consignment of slaves was brought to Lisbon; and 
slave trading soon became one of the most profitable branches 
of Portuguese commerce. The Senegal was reached in 1445, 
Cape Verde was passed in the same year, and in 1446 Alvaro 
Fernandes pushed on almost as far as Sierra Leone. This was 
probably the farthest point reached before the Navigator died 
(r46o). Meanwhile colonization progressed in the Azores and 
Madeira, where sugar and wine were produced; above all, the 
gold brought home from Guinea stimulated the commercial 
energy of the Portuguese. It had become clear that, apart 
from their religious and scientific aspects, these voyages of dis- 
covery were highly profitable. Under Alphonso V., surnamed 
the African (1443-1481), the Gulf of Guinea was explored as far 
as Cape St Catherine, and three expeditions (1458, 1461, 1471) 
were sent to Morocco; in 147 1 Arzila (Asila) and Tangier were 
captured from the Moors. Under John II. (1481-1495) the fort- 
ress of Sao Jorge da Mina, the modern Elmina {q.v.), was founded

mn<UobnlI.p {dz ^ doubled the Cape of Good Hope in I4 g 8) 

thus proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible by sea. 
After 1492 the discovery of the West Indies by Columbus ren- 
dered desirable a delimitation of the Spanish and Portuguese 
spheres of exploration. This was accomplished by the treaty 
of Tordesillas (June 7, 1494) which modified the delimitation 
authorized by Pope Alexander VI. in two bulls issued on the 
4th of May, 1493. The treaty gave to Portugal all lands which 
might be discovered east of a straight line drawn from the 
Arctic Pole to the Antarctic, at a distance of 370 leagues west 
of Cape Verde. Spain received the lands discovered west of 
this line. As, however, the known means of measuring lon- 
gitude were so inexact that the line of demarcation could not 
in practice be determined (see J. de Andrade C9rvo in Journal 



das Sciencias Malhematicas, xxxi. 147-176, Lisbon, 1881), the 
treaty was subject to very diverse interpretations. On its 
provisions were based both the Portuguese claim to Brazil and 
the Spanish claim to the Moluccas (see Malay Archipelago: 
History). The treaty was chiefly valuable to the Portuguese 
as a recognition of the prestige they had acquired. That prestige 
was enormously enhanced when, in 1497-1499, Vasco da Gama 
(q.v.) completed the voyage to India. 

While the Crown was thus acquiring new possessions, its 
authority in Portugal was temporarily overshadowed by the 
growth of aristocratic privilege. At the cortes The 
of Evora (1433) Kmg Edward had obtained the Monarchy 
enactment of a law 1 declaring that the estates and the 
granted by John I. to his adherents could only be Nobie ** 
inherited by the direct male descendants of the grantees, and 
failing such descendants, should revert to the Crown. After 
the death of Edward further attempts to curb the power of the 
nobles weie made by his brother, D. Pedro, duke of Coimbra, 
who acted as regent during the minority of Alphonso V. (1438- 
1447). The head of the aristocratic opposition was the duke of 
Braganza, who contrived to secure the sympathy of the king 
and the dismissal of the regent. The quarrel led to civil war, 
and in May 1449 D. Pedro was defeated and killed. Thence- 
forward the grants made by John I. were renewed, and ex- 
tended on so lavish a scale that the Braganza estates alone 
comprised about a third of the whole kingdom. An unwise 
foreign policy simultaneously injured the royal prestige, for 
Alphonso married his own niece, Joanna, daughter of Henry IV. 
of Castile, and claimed that kingdom in her name. At the 
battle of Toro, in 1476, he was defeated by Ferdinand and 
Isabella, and in 1478 he was compelled to sign the treaty of 
Alcantara, by which Joanna was relegated to a convent- His 
successor, John II. (1481-1495) reverted to the policy of matri- 
monial alliances with Castile and friendship with England. 
Finding, as he said, that the liberality of former kings had left 
the Crown "no estates except the high roads of Portugal," 
he determined to crush the feudal nobility and seize its 
territories. A cortes held at Evora (1481) empowered 
judges nominated by the Crown to administer justice 
in all feudal domains. The nobles resisted this infringement 
of their rights; but their leader, Ferdinand, duke of Braganza, 
was beheaded for high treason in 1483; in 1484 the king stabbed 
to death his own brother-in-law, Ferdinand, duke of Vizeu; and 
80 other members of the aristocracy were afterwards executed. 
Thus John " the Perfect," as he was called, assured the supre- 
macy of the Crown. He was succeeded in 1495 by Emanuel 
(Manoel) I., who was named " the Great " or " the Fortunate," 
because in his reign the sea route to India was discovered and 
a Portuguese Empire founded. 

4. The Portuguese Empire: 1499-1580.-1x1 1 500 King 
Emanuel assumed the title " Lord of the conquest, navigation 
and commerce of India, Ethiopia, Arabia and Persia," which 
was confirmed by Pope Alexander VI. in 1502. It was now 
upon schemes of conquest that the energy of the nation was to 
be concentrated, although the motives which called forth that 
energy were unchanged. " We come to seek Christians and 
spices," said the first of Vasco da Gama's sailors who landed 
in India: and the combination of missionary ardour with 
commercial enterprise which had led to the exploration of the 
Atlantic led also to the establishment of a Portuguese Empire. 
This expansion of national interests proceeded rapidly in almost 
every quarter of the known world. In the North Atlantic 
Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real penetrated as far as Green- 
land (their " Labrador ") in 1500-1501; but these voyages were 
politically and commercially unimportant. Equally barren was 
the intermittent fighting in Morocco, which was regarded as a 
crusade against the Moors. In the South Atlantic, however, 
the African coast was further explored, new settlements were 
founded, and a remarkable development of Portuguese-African 
civilization took place in the kingdom of Kongo (see Angola). 

t l Known as the lei mental, because it was supposed to fulfil the 
intention which John I. had in mind when the grants were made.

[HISTORY 



Pedro Alvares Cabral, sailing to India, hut steering far westward 
to avoid the winds and currents of the Guinea coast, reached 
Brazil (1500) and claimed it for his sovereign. Joao da Nova 
discovered Ascension (1501) and St Helena (1502); Tristao 
da Cunha was the first to sight the archipelago still known by 
his name (1506). In East Africa the small Mahommedan 
states along the coast — Sofala, Mozambique, Kilwa, Brava, 
Mombasa, Mah'ndi — either were destroyed or became subjects 
or allies of Portugal. Pedro de Covilham had reached Abys- 
sinia (q.v.) as early as 1490; in 1520 a Portuguese embassy 
arrived at the court of " Prester John," and in 1541 a military 
force was sent to aid him in repelling a Mahommedan invasion. 
In the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, one of Cabral's ships 
discovered Madagascar (1501), which was partly explored by 
Tristao da Cunha (1507); Mauritius was discovered in 1507, 
Socotra occupied in 1506, and in the same year D. Lourenco 
d'Almeida visited Ceylon. In the Red Sea Massawa was the 
most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, 
when a fleet under Estevao da Gama penetrated as far as Suez. 
Hormuz, in the Persian Gulf, was seized by Alphonso d'Albu- 
querque (1515), who also entered into diplomatic relations 
with Persia. On the Asiatic mainland the first trading-stations 
were established by Cabral at Cochin and Calicut (1501); more 
important, however, were the conquest of Goa (1510) and Ma- 
lacca (1511) by Albuquerque, and the acquisition of Diu (153s) 
by Martim Affonso de Sousa. East of Malacca, Albuquerque 
sent Duarte Fernandes as envoy to Siam (1511), and despatched 
to the Moluccas two expeditions (1S12, 1514), which founded 
the Portuguese dominion in the Malay Archipelago (q.v.). 
Fernao Pires de Andrade visited Canton in 1517 and opened up 
trade with China, where in 1557 the Portuguese were permitted 
to occupy Macao. Japan, accidentally discovered by three 
Portuguese traders in 1542, soon attracted large numbers of 
merchants and missionaries (see Japan, § viii.). In 1522 one of 
the ships of Ferdinand Magellan (q.v.) — a Portuguese sailor, 
though in the Spanish service — completed the first voyage 
round the world. 

Up to 1505 the Portuguese voyages to the East were little 
more than trading ventures or plundering raids, although* a 
Almeida few " factories " for the exchange of goods were 
andAibu- founded in Malabar. In theory, the objects of 
querque. ]^ n g EmanueFs policy were the establishment of 
friendly commercial relations with the Hindus (who were at 
first mistaken for Christians " not yet confirmed in the faith," 
as the king wrote to Alexander VI.) and the prosecution of a cru- 
sade against Islam. But Hindu and Mahommedan interests were 
found to be so closely interwoven that this policy became imprac- 
ticable, and it was superseded when D. Francisco d'Almeida 
(q.v.) went to India as first Portuguese viceroy in 1505. Almeida 
sought to subordinate all else to sea power and commerce, 
to concentrate the whole naval and military force of the 
kingdom on the maintenance of maritime ascendancy; to annex 
no territory, to avoid risking troops ashore, and to leave the 
defence of such factories as might be necessary to friendly native 
powers, which would receive in return the support of the Portu- 
guese fleet. Almeida's statesmanship was to a great extent 
sound. The Portuguese could never penetrate far inland; 
throughout the 16th century their settlements were confined 
to the coasts of Asia, Africa or America, and the area they were 
able effectively to occupy was far less than the area of their 
empire in the 20th century. A Chinese critic, quoted by Faria 
y Sousa, said of them that they were like fishes, " remove them 
from the water and they straightway die." It is thus absurd 
to speak of a "Portuguese conquest of India"; in a land 
campaign they would have been outnumbered and destroyed 
by the armies of any one of the greater Indian states. But 
their artillery and superior maritime science made them almost 
invulnerable at sea, and their principal military achievements 
consisted in the capture or defence of positions accessible from 
the sea, e.g. the defence of Cochin by Duarte Pacheco Pereira 
in 1504, the defence of Diu (q.v.) in 1538 and 1546. 

Alphonso d'Albuquerque (qv.), who succeeded Almeida in 



1509, found it necessary to modify the policy formulated by 
his predecessor. Command of the sea could not be maintained 
— least of all in the monsoon months — while the Portuguese 
fleets were based on Lisbon, which could only be reached after a 
six months' voyage; and experience had proved that almost 
every Portuguese factory required a fortress -for its defence 
when the fleets were absent. Portugal, like every great maritime 
trading community from Carthage to Venice, discovered that 
the ideal of " sea power and commerce " led directly to empire. 
In 1510 Albuquerque seized Goa, primarily as a naval base, 
and in so doing recognized the fact that his country was com- 
mitted to a policy of territorial aggrandisement. Other sea- 
ports and islands were conquered or colonized in rapid succession, 
and by 1540 Portugal had acquired a line of scattered maritime 
possessions extending along the coasts of Brazil, East and West 
Africa, Malabar, Ceylon, Persia, Indo-China and the Malay 
Archipelago. The most important settlements in the East were 
Goa, Malacca and Hormuz. 

To a superficial observer the prosperity of Portugal might 
well seem to have culminated during this period of expansion. 
Vast profits were derived from the import trade in the innumer- 
able products of the tropics, of which Portugal was the sole 
purveyor in Europe. This influx of wealth furnished the 
economic basis for a sudden development of literary and artistic 
activity, inspired by contrast with the new world of the tropics. 
The 1 6th century was the golden age of Portuguese literature; 
humanists, such as Damiao de Goes (q.v.), and scientists, such 
as the astronomer Pedro Nunes (Nonius), played conspicuous 
parts in the great intellectual movements of the time; a dis- 
tinctive school of painters arose, chief among them being the 
so-called " Grao Vasco " (Vasco Fernandes of Vizeu); in 
architecture the name of King Emanuel was given to a new 
and composite style (the Manoeline or Manoellian), in which 
decorative forms from India and Africa were harmonized with 
Gothic and Renaissance designs; palaces, fortresses, cathedrals, 
monasteries, were built on a scale never before attempted in 
Portugal; and even in the minor arts and handicrafts — in gold- 
smith's work, for example, or in pottery — the influence of the 
East made itself felt. Oriental splendour and Renaissance 
culture combined to render social life in Lisbon hardly less 
brilliant than in Rome or Venice. 

In order to understand the apparently sudden collapse of 
Portuguese power in 1 578-1 580 it is necessary to examine 
certain facts and tendencies which from the first rendered a 
catastrophe inevitable. Chief among these were the extent of 
the empire and its organization, the financial and commercial 
policy of its rulers, the hostility, often wantonly provoked, 
of the chief Oriental states, the depopulation of Portugal and 
the slave trade, the expulsion of the Jews, the growth of 
ecclesiastical influence in secular affairs, and the decadence 
of the monarchy. 

It is necessary to exclude Brazil from any survey of the Portu- 
guese imperial system, because the colonization of Brazil (q.v.) 
was effected on distinctive lines. Otherwise the imperial 
whole empire was governed on a more or less uniform Organlza~ 
system, although it included communities of the most tloa * 
diverse nature — protectorates such as Hormuz and Ternate in the 
Moluccas, colonies such as Goa and Madeira, captaincies under 
military rule such as Malacca, tributary states such as Kilwa, 
fortified factories as at Colombo and Cochin. West of the Cape 
the settlements in Africa and the Atlantic were governed, as a 
rule, by officials directly nominated by the king. East of the 
Cape, the royal power was delegated to a viceroy or governor — 
the distinction was purely titular — whose legislative and execu- 
tive authority was almost unlimited during his term of office. 
The viceroyalty was created in 1505, and from 151 1 the Indian 
capital was Goa. Between 1505 and 1580 only four holders 
of the office— Almeida (1505-1500), Albuquerque (1500-1515), 
D. Vasco da Gama (1524) and D. Joao de Castro (1 545-1 548) — 
were men of marked ability and high character. All officials, 
including the viceroy and naval and military officers, were usually 
appointed for no more than three years. Although few large

salaries were paid, the perquisites attached to official positions 
were enormous; at the beginning of the 1 7th century, for example, 
the captain of Malacca received not quite £300 yearly as his 
pay, but his annual profits from other sources were estimated at 
£20,000. Even judges were expected to live on their perquisites, 
in the shape of bribes. The competition for appointments was 
naturally very keen; Couto mentions the case of one grantee 
who received the reversion of a post to which 30 applicants had 
a prior claim. 1 Such reversions could be sold, bequeathed, or 
included in the dowries of married women; the right of trading 
with China might be part of the endowment of a school; a 
monastery or a hospital might purchase the command of a 
fortress. In 1538 the viceroy, D. Garcia de Noronha, publicly 
sold by auction every vacant appointment in Portuguese India — 
an example followed in 1614 by the king. Hardly less disas- 
trous than the system by which officials were chosen and paid 
was the influence exercised by the Church. Simao Botelho, an 
able revenue officer, was denied absolution in 1543 because he 
had reorganized the Malacca customs-house without previously 
consulting the Dominicans in that city. In 1560 a supposed 
tooth of Buddha was brought to Goa; the raja of Pegu offered 
£100,000 for the relic, and as Portuguese India was virtually 
bankrupt the government wished to accept the offer; but the 
archbishop intervened and the relic was destroyed. 

The empire in the East was rarely solvent. Almeida and 
Albuquerque had hoped to meet the expense of administration 
mainly out of the fees extorted for safe-conducts 
at sea and trading-licences, with the tribute wrung 
from native states and the revenue from Crown lands in India. 
But the growth of expenditure — chiefly of an unremunerative 
kind, such as the cost of war and missions — soon rendered these 
resources inadequate; and after 151 5 the empire became ever 
more dependent on the spoils of hostile states and on subsidies 
from the royal treasury in Lisbon. Systematic debasement of 
the coinage was practised both in India, where the monetary 
system was extremely complex, 2 and in Portugal; and owing 
to the bullionist policy adopted by Portuguese financiers little 
permanent benefit accrued to the mother country from its im- 
mense trade. Seeking for commercial profit, not in the exchange 
of commodities, but solely in the acquisition of actual gold and 
silver, and realizing that the home market could not absorb a 
tithe of the merchandise imported, the Lisbon capitalists sent 
their ships to discharge in Antwerp (where a Portuguese staple 
was established in 1503), or in some other port near the central 
markets of Europe. The raw materials purchased by Flemish, 
German or English traders were used in the establishment of 
productive industries, while Portugal received a vast influx of 
bullion, most of which was squandered on war, luxuries or 
the Church. 

In theory the most lucrative branches of commerce, such 
as the pepper trade, were monopolies vested in the Crown; 
Commercial the chartered companies and associations of merchant 
Policy. adventurers, which afterwards became the pioneers 
of British and Dutch colonial development, had no counterpart 
in Portuguese history, except in the few cases in which trading 
concessions were granted to military or monastic orders. But 
the Crown frequently farmed out its monopob'es to individual 
merchants, or granted trading-licences by way of pension or 
reward. These were often of great value; e.g. in 1612 the right 
of sending a merchant ship to China was valued at £25,000. 
Great loss was necessarily inflicted on native traders by the 
monopolist system, which pressed most hardly on the Mahom- 
medans, who had been the chief carriers in Indian waters. Two 
great powers, Egypt and Turkey, challenged the naval and 
commercial supremacy of the Portuguese, but an Egyptian 
armada was destroyed by Almeida in 1509, and though Ottoman 
fleets were on several occasions (as in 1517 and 1521) despatched 
from Suez or Basra, they failed to achieve any success, and the 
Portuguese were able to close the two principal trade routes

1898), pp. 67-72. 



between India and Europe. One of these trade routes passed 
up the Persian Gulf to Basra, and thence overland to Tripoli, 
for Mediterranean ports, and to Trebizond, for Constantinople. 
The other passed up the Red Sea to Suez, and thence to 
Alexandria, for Venice, Genoa and Ragusa. But by occupying 
Hormuz the Portuguese gained command of the Gulf route; 
and though they thrice failed to capture Aden (1513, 1517, 
1547), and so entirely to close the Red Sea, they almost destroyed 
the traffic between India and Suez by occupying Socotra and 
sending fleets to cruise in the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb. In 
Malacca they possessed the connecting link between the trade- 
routes of the Far and Middle East, and thus they controlled 
the three sea-gates of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea— the 
Straits of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb and Malacca — and diverted 
the maritime trade with Europe to the Cape route. 

During the critical period in which their empire was being 
established (c. 1505-1550) the Portuguese were fortunate in 
escaping conflict with any Oriental power of the first ReJniioBS 
rank except Egypt and Turkey; for the Bahmani W Hh 
sultanate of the Deccan had been already disinte- Oriental 
grated before 1498, and the Mughals and Mahrattas sutes - 
were still far off. A coalition of the minor Mahommedan states 
was prevented by the great Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar, which 
comprised the southern half of the Indian Peninsula. Vijaya- 
nagar gave the militant Mahommedanism of Northern India no 
opportunity for a combined attack on the Portuguese settle- 
ments. After 1565, when the power of Vijayanagar was broken 
at the battle of Talikot, a Mussulman coalition was at last 
formed, and the Portuguese were confronted by a line of hostile 
states stretching from Gujarat to Achin; but by this time they 
were strong enough to hold their own. It is characteristic of 
their native policy that they had not only refrained from aiding 
Vijayanagar in 1565, but had even been willing to despoil then- 
Hindu allies. In 1543 Martim Affonso de Sousa, governor of 
India, organized an expedition to sack the Hindu temples at 
Conjeveram in Vijayanagar itself, and similar incidents are 
common in Indo-Portuguese history. Albuquerque was almost 
the only Portuguese statesman who strove to deal justly with 
both Hindus and Mahommedans, to respect native customs, and 
to establish friendly relations with the great powers of the East. 
Apart from the rigorous restrictions imposed by his successors 
upon trade, the sympathies of the natives were estranged by the 
harshness and venality of Portuguese administration, by such 
barbarities as the wholesale mutilation of non-combatants in 
war-time, and by religious persecution. After the arrival of the 
Franciscan missionaries, in 1517, Goa gradually became the 
headquarters of an immense proselytizing organization, which 
by 1 561 had extended to East Africa, China, Japan and the 
Malay Archipelago (see Goa: Ecclesiastical History). Wherever 
the Portuguese were supreme they endeavoured to obtain con- 
verts by force. The widespread resentment thus aroused was a 
frequent cause of insurrection, and between 15 15 and 1580 not a 
single year passed without war between the Portuguese and at 
least one African or Asiatic people. 

Centuries of fighting against the Moors and Castilians had 
already left Portugal thinly populated; large tracts of land 
were uncultivated, especially in Alemtejo, and wolves Depopu- 
were still common throughout the kingdom. It was l*tion. 
impossible, from the first, to garrison the empire with trained 
men. As early as 1 505 one of Almeida's ships contained a crew 
of rustics unable to distinguish between port and starboard; 
soon afterwards it became necessary to recruit convicts and 
slaves, and in 1538 a royal pardon was granted to all prisoners 
who would serve in India, except criminals under sentence for 
treason and canonical offences. Linschoten estimates that of all 
those who went to the East not one in ten returned. The heaviest 
losses were due to war, shipwreck and tropical diseases, but large 
numbers of the underpaid or unpaid soldiers deserted to the 
armies of native states. It is impossible to give more than 
approximately accurate statistics of the resultant depopulation 
of Portugal; but it seems probable that the inhabitants of the 
kingdom decreased from about 1,800,000 or 2,000,000 in 1500 to

[HISTORY 



about 1,080,000 in 1586. The process of decay was hastened 
by frequent outbreaks of plague, sometimes followed. by famine; 
a contemporary manuscript estimates that no fewer than 500 
persons died daily in Lisbon alone during July, August and 
September 1569, and in some other years the joint effects of 
plague and famine were little less disastrous. 

While the country was being drained of its best citizens, 
hordes of slaves were imported to fill the vacancies, especially 
into the southern provinces. 1 Manual labour was 
Trade*™ tnus discredited; the peasants sold their farms and 
emigrated or flocked to the towns; and small hold- 
ings were merged into vast estates, unscientifically cultivated 
by slaves and comparable with the latifundia which caused so 
many agrarian evils during the last two centuries of the Roman 
republic. The decadence of agriculture partly explains the 
prevalence of famine at a time when Portuguese maritime 
commerce was most prosperous. The Portuguese intermarried 
freely with their slaves, and this infusion of alien blood profoundly 
modified the character and physique of the nation. It may be 
said without exaggeration that the Portuguese of the " age of 
discoveries " and the Portuguese of the 17 th and later centuries 
were two different races. Albuquerque, foreseeing the dangers 
that would arise from a shortage of population in his colonies, 
had encouraged his soldiers to marry captive Brahman and 
Mahommedan women, and to settle in India as farmers, shop- 
keepers or artisans. Under his rule the experiment was fairly 
successful, but the married colonists afterwards became a privi- 
leged caste, subsisting upon the labour of their slaves, and often 
disloyal to their rulers. Intermarriage led to the adoption, even 
by the rich, and especially by women (see Goa), of Asiatic dress, 
manners and modes of thought. Thus in the East, as in Europe, 
slavery reacted upon every class of the Portuguese. 

The banishment, or forcible conversion, of the Jews deprived 
Portugal of its middle class and of its most scientific traders and 
The Perse financiers. Though the Jews had always been 
cation of compelled to reside in separate quarters called 
the Jews, Juderias, or Jewries, they had been protected by 
the earlier Portuguese kings. Before 1223 their courts had 
received autonomy in civil and criminal jurisdiction; their chief 
rabbi was appointed by the king and entitled to use the royal 
arms on his seal. Alphonso V. even permitted his Jewish subjects 
to live outside the Juderias, relieved them from the obligation 
to wear a distinctive costume (enforced in 1325), and nominated 
a Jew, Isaac Abrabanel (q.v.) f as his minister of finance. In 
culture the Portuguese Jews surpassed their rulers. Many of 
them were well versed in Aristotelian and Arabic philosophy, in 
astronomy, mathematics, and especially in medicine. Three 
Hebrew printing-presses were established between 1487 and 1495; 
both John II. and Emanuel I. employed Jewish physicians; it 
was a Jew — Abraham Zacuto ben Samuel — who supplied Vasco 
da Gama with nautical instruments; and Jews were employed 
in the overland journeys by which the Portuguese court first 
endeavoured to obtain information on Far Eastern affairs. 
The Jews paid taxes on practically every business transaction, 
besides a special poll-tax of 30 dinheiros in memory of the 30 
pieces of .silver paid to Judas Iscariot ; and for this reason they 
were protected by the Crown. For centuries they were also 
tolerated by the commons; but the other orders — ecclesiastics 
and nobles — resented their religious exclusiveness or envied their 
wealth, and gradually fostered the growth of popular prejudice 
against them. In 1449 the Lisbon Juderias were stormed and 
sacked, and between 1450 and 1481 the cortes four times 
petitioned the Crown to enforce the an ti- Jewish provisions of 
the canon law. John II. gave asylum to 90,000 Jewish refugees 
from Castile, in return for a heavy poll-tax and on condition 
that they should leave the country within eight months, in ships 
furnished by himself. These ships were not provided in time, 
and the Jews who were thus unable to depart were enslaved, 

1 In the north, which had been relatively immune from wars 
agriculture was more prosperous and the peasants more tenacious 
of their land; hence the continuance of peasant proprietorship 
and the rarity of African types between the Douro and the Minho. 



while their children were deported to the island of St Thomas, 
and there left to survive as best they might. In 1496 Emanuel I. 
desired to wed Isabella, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, but 
found that he was first required to purify his kingdom of the 
Jews, who were accordingly commanded to leave Portugal before 
the end of October 1497. But in order to avoid the economic 
dangers threatened by such an exodus, every Jew and Jewess 
between the ages of 4 and 24 was seized and forcibly baptized 
(19th March): "Christians" were not required to emigrate. 
In October 20,000 adults were treated in the same way. These 
" New Christians " or " Maranos," as they were called, were 
forbidden to leave the country between 1498 and 1507. In 
April 1506 most of those who resided in Lisbon were massacred 
during a riot, but throughout the rest of Emanuel's reign they 
were immune from violence, and were again permitted to 
emigrate — an opportunity of which the majority took advantage. 
Large numbers settled in Holland, where their commercial talent 
afterwards greatly assisted the Dutch in their rivalry with the 
Portuguese. 

The Reformation never reached Portugal, but even here the 
critical tendencies which elsewhere preceded Reform, were 
already at work. Their origin is to be sought not Tne 
so much in the Revival of Learning as in the fact that inquisition 
the Portuguese had learned, on their voyages of * a <* the 
discovery, to see and think for themselves. The s * 

true scientific spirit may be traced throughout the Roteiros of 
D. Joao de Castro (q.v.) and the Colloquios of Garcia de Orta — 
men who deserted books for experiment and manifested a new 
interest in the physical world. But orthodox churchmen feared 
that even in Portugal this appeal from authority to experience 
would lead to an attack upon religious doctrines previously 
regarded as beyond criticism. To check this dangerous move- 
ment of ideas, they demanded the introduction of the Inquisition 
into Portugal. The agents of the " New Christians " in Rome 
long contrived, by lavish bribery and with the support of many 
enlightened Portuguese, to delay the preliminary negotiations; 
but in 1536 the Holy Office was established in Lisbon, where the 
first auto-da-fe* was held in 1540, and in 1560 its operations were 
extended to India. It seems probable that the influence of the 
tribunal upon Portuguese life and thought has been exaggerated, 
Autos-da-fi were rare events; their victims were not as a rule 
serious thinkers, but persons accused of sorcery or Judaizing, 
nor were they more numerous than the victims of the English 
laws relating to witchcraft and heresy. But the worst vices 
of the Inquisition were the widespread system of delation it 
encouraged by paying informers out of the property of the con- 
demned, and its action as a trading and landholding association. 
Quite as serious, in their effects upon national life, were the 
severe censorship to which all printed matter was liable before 
publication and the control of education by the Jesuits. Poetry 
and imaginative literature usually escaped censure; but histories 
were mutilated and all original scientific and philosophical work 
was banned. Portuguese education centred in the national 
university "of Coimbra, which had long shown itself ready to 
assimilate new ideas; between 1537 and 1547 John III. persuaded 
many eminent foreign teachers — among them the Scottish 
humanist George Buchanan (q.v.) and the French mathematician 
£lie Vinet — to lecture in its schools. But the discipline of the 
university needed reform, and the task was entrusted to the 
Jesuits. By 1555 they had secured control over Coimbra — a 
control which lasted for two centuries and extended to the whole 
educational system of the country. The effects of this change 
upon the national character were serious and permanent. 
Portugal sank back into the middle ages. The old initiative 
and self-reliance of the nation, already shaken by years of disaster, 
were now completely undermined, and the people submitted 
without show of resistance to a theocracy disguised as absolute 
monarchy. 

Emanuel I. had been a fearless despot, such as Portugal 
needed if its scattered dependencies were to remain subject to 
the central government. During his reign (1495-1521) the 
Church was never permitted to encroach upon the royal

prerogative. He even sent ambassadors to Rome to protest against 
ecclesiastical corruption, as well as to checkmate the Venetian 
Decadence diplomatists who threatened Europe with Ottoman 
o/the vengeance if the Portuguese commercial monopoly 
Monarchy. were not re j axec i. The Oriental magnificence of these 
embassies, notably that of 15 14, and the fact that a king of 
Portugal dared openly to criticize the morals- of the Vatican, 
temporarily enhanced the prestige of the monarchy. But 
Emanuel I. was the last great king of the Aviz dynasty. He had 
pursued the traditional policy of intermarriage with the royal 
families of Castile and Aragon, hoping to weld together the 
Spanish and Portuguese dominions into a single world-wide 



" Sebastianism " became a religion; its* votaries were numbyed 
by thousands, and four impostors arose in succession, each 
claiming to be the ret ettcuberto, or " hidden king," whose advent 
was so ardently desired (see Sebastian). 

There was no surviving prince of the Aviz dynasty except the 
aged, feeble and almost insane Cardinal Prince Henry, who, as a 
younger son of Emanuel I., now became king. Henry died on 
the 31st of January 1580, and the throne was thus left vacant. 
There were fivt principal claimants — Philip II. of Spain; Phili- 
bert, duke of Savoy; Antonio, prior of Crato; Catherine, duchess 
of Braganza; and Ranuccio, duke of Parma — whose relationship

empire ruled by the house of Aviz. His ambition narrowly 
missed fulfilment, for Prince Miguel, his eldest son, was recognized 
(1498) as heir to the Spanish thrones. But Miguel died in infancy, 
and his inheritance passed to the Habsburgs. Frequent inter- 
marriage, often so far within the prohibited degress as to require 
a papal dispensation, iflay possibly explain the weakened vitality 
of the Portuguese royal family, which was now subject to epilepsy, 
insanity and^premature decay. The decadence of the monarchy 
as a national institution was reflected in the decadence of the 
cortes, which was rarely summoned between 1521 and 1580. 
John III. (1521-1557) was a ruler of fair ability, who became in 
his later years wholly subservient to his ecclesiastical advisers. 
He was succeeded by his grandson Sebastian (1 557-1 578), aged 
three years. Until the king came of age (1568), his grandmother, 
Queen Catherine, a fanatical daughter of Isabella the Catholic, and 
his great-uncle, Prince Henry, cardinal and inquisitor-general, 
governed as joint regents. Both were dominated by their Jesuit 
confessors, and a Jesuit, D. Luiz Goncalves da Camara, became 
the tutor and, after 1568, the principal adviser of Sebastian. 
The king was a strong-willed and weak-minded ascetic, who 
entrusted his empire to the Jesuits, refused to marry, although 
The the dynasty was threatened with extinction, and 

Disaster of spent years in preparing for a crusade against the 
AlKasr. Moors. The wisest act of John III. had been his 
withdrawal of all the Portuguese garrisons in Morocco except 
those at Ceuta, Arzila and Tangier. Sebastian reversed tfcis 
policy. His first expedition to Africa (1574) was a mere recon- 
naissance, but four years later a favourable opportunity for 
invasion arrived. A dethroned sultan of Morocco, named 
Mulai Ahmad (Mahommed XI.), offered to acknowledge Portu- 
guese suzerainty if he were restored to the throne by Portuguese 
arms, and Sebastian eagerly accepted these terms. The flower 
of his army was in Asia and his treasury was empty; but he 
contrived to extort funds from the " New Christians," and col- 
lected a force of some 18,000 men, chiefly untrained lads, worn- 
out veterans, and foreign free-lances. At Arzila, where he landed, 
he was joined by Mulai Ahmad, who could only muster 800 
soldiers. Thence Sebastian sought to proceed overland to the 
seaport of El Araish, despite the advice of his ally and of others 
who knew the country. After a long desert march under an 
August sun, he took up an indefensible position in a valley near 
Al Kasr al Kebir (q.v.). On the morrow (Aug. 4, 1578) they 
were surrounded by the superior forces of Abd el Malek, the 
reigning sultan, and after a brave resistance Sebastian was killed 
and his army almost annihilated. So overwhelming was the 
disaster that the Portuguese people refused to believe the truth. 
It was rumoured that Sebastian still lived, and would sooner or 
later return and restore the past greatness of his country.

5. The " Sixty Years' Captivity "1 1581-1640. — The university 
of Coimbra declared in favour of Catherine, duchess of Braganza, 
but the prior of Crato was the only rival who offered any serious 
resistance to Philip II. D. Antonio proclaimed himself king and 
occupied Lisbon. The advocates of union with Spain, however, 
were numerous, influential, and ably led by their spokesmen in the 
cortes, Christovao de Moura and Antonio Pinheiro, bishop of 
Leiria. The duke of Braganza was won over to their side, chiefly 
by the promise that he should be king of Brazil if Philip H. 
became king of Portugal — a promise never fulfilled. Above all, 
the Church, including the Society of Jesus, naturally favoured 
the Habsburg claimant, who represented its two foremost 
champions, Spain and Austria. In 1581 a Spanish army, led 
by the duke of Alva, entered Portugal and easily defeated the 
levies of D. Antonio at Alcantara. The prior escaped to Paris 
and appealed to France and England for assistance. In 1582 a 
French fleet attempted to seize the Azores in his interest, but 
was defeated. In 1589 an English fleet was sent to aid the prior 
in a projected invasion of Portugal, but owing to a quarrel 
between its commanders, Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norris, 
the expedition was abandoned. D. Antonio returned to Paris, 
where he died in 1594. 

Meanwhile the victory of Alcantara left Philip II. supreme 
in Portugal, where he was soon afterwards crowned king. His 
constitutional position was defined at the Cortes of Thomar 
(1581). Portugal was not to be regarded as a conquered or 
annexed province, but as a separate kingdom, joined to Spain 
solely by a personal union similar to the union between Castile 
and Aragon under Ferdinand and Isabella. At Thomar Philip 
II. promised to maintain the rights and liberties conceded by his 
predecessors on the Portuguese throne, to summon the Cortes at 
frequent intervals, and to create a Portuguese privy council 
which should accompany the king everywhere and be consulted 
on all matters affecting Portuguese interests. Brazil and the 
settlements in Africa and Asia were still to belong to Portugal, 
not to Spain, and neither in Portugal nor in its colonies was any 
alien to be given lands, public office, or jurisdiction. On these 
terms the political union of the Iberian Peninsula was accom- 
plished. It was the final stage in a process of accretion dating 
back to the beginnings of the Christian reconquest in the 8th 
century. Asturias had been united with Leon, Leon with Castile, 
Castile with Aragon. All these precedents seemed to indicate 
that Spain and Portugal would ultimately form* one state; and 
despite the strong nationalism which their separate language and 



148 



PORTUGAL 



[HISTORY 



history had inspired among the Portuguese, the union of 1581 
might have endured if the terms of the Thomar compact had 
been observed. But few of the promises made in 158 1 were 
kept by the three Spanish kings who ruled over Portugal — 
Philip II. (1581-1598), Philip III. (1598-1621) and Philip IV. 
(1621-1640). 1 The cortes was only once summoned (1619), 
and the government of Portugal was entrusted by Philip III. 
chiefly to Francis duke of Lerma, by Philip IV. chiefly to OHvares 
(q.v.). The kingdom and its dependencies were also involved in 
the naval disasters which overtook Spain. Faro in Algarve was 
sacked in 1595 by the English, who ravaged the Azores in 1596; 
and .in many parts of the world English, French and Dutch 
combined to harass Portuguese trade and seize Portuguese 
possessions. (See especially Brazil; India; Malay Archi- 
pelago.) Union with Spain had exposed Portugal to the 
hostility of the strongest naval powers of western Europe, 
and had deprived it of the power to conclude an independent 
peace. 

Insurrections in Lisbon (1634) and Evora (1637) bore witness 
to the general discontent, but until 1640 the Spanish ascendancy 
The was never seriously endangered. In 1640 war with 

Rebellion France and a revolution in Catalonia had taxed the 
of 1640. military resources of Spain to the utmost. The 
royal authority in Portugal was delegated to Margaret of Savoy, 
duchess of Mantua, whose train of Spanish and Italian courtiers 
aroused the jealousy of the Portuguese nobles, while the harsh 
rule of her secretary of state; Miguel de Vasconcellos de Brito, 
provoked the resentment of all classes. Even the Jesuits, whose 
influence in Portugal had steadily increased since 1555, were 
now prepared to act in the interests of Cardinal Richelieu, and 
therefore against Philip IV. A leader was found in John, 8th duke 
of Braganza, who as a grandson of the duchess Catherine was 
descended from Emanuel I. The duke, however, was naturally 
indolent, and it was with difficulty that his ambitious and energetic 
Castilian wife, D. Luiza de Guzman, obtained his assent to the 
proposed revolution. He refused to take any active part in it; 
but D. Luiza and her confidential adviser, Joao Pinto Ribeiro, 
recruited a powerful band of conspirators among the disaffected 
nobles. Their plans were carefully elaborated, and on the 1st of 
December 1640 various strategic points were seized, the few 
partisans of Spain who attempted resistance were overpowered, 
and a provisional government was formed under D. Rodrigo da 
Cunha, archbishop of Lisbon, who was appointed lieutenant- 
general of Portugal. 

6. The Restoration: 1640-1755. — On the 13th of December 
1640 the duke of Braganza was crowned as John IV., and on the 
19th of January 1641 the cortes formally accepted him as king. 
The whole country had already declared in his favour and expelled 
the Spanish garrisons, an example followed by all the Portuguese 
dependencies. Thus the " Sixty Years' Captivity " came to an 
end and the throne passed to the house of Braganza. But the 
Portuguese were well aware that they could hardly maintain 
their independence without foreign assistance, and ambassadors 
were at once sent to Great Britain, the Netherlands and France. 
The struggle between the Crown and the parliament prevented 
Charles I. from offering aid, but he immediately recognized 
John IV. as king. Richelieu and the states-general of the Nether- 
lands despatched fleets to the Tagus; but commercial rivalry 
in Brazil and the East led soon afterwards to a colonial war 
with the Dutch, and Portugal was left without any aliy except 
France. 

The Portuguese armies were at first successful. D. Matheus 
d'Albuquerque defeated the Spaniards under the baron of 
War with Molingen at Monti jo (May 26, 1644), and through- 
Spain, out the reign of John IV. (1 640-1 656) they suffered 
1640-1668* no serious reverse. But great anxiety was caused 
by a plot to restore Spanish rule, in which the duke of Caminha 
and the archbishop of Braga were implicated; and especially 
by the action of Mazarin, who had assumed control of French 
foreign policy in 1642. At the congress of Miinster (1643) ne 
refused to make the independence of Portugal a condition of 
1 Philip I., II. and III. of Portugal. 



peace between France and Spain; and in a letter dated the 
4th of October 1647 he even offered the Portuguese Crown 
to the duke of Longueville — an offer which illustrates the 
weakness of John IV. and the dependence of Portugal upon 
France. 

John IV. was succeeded by his second son, Alphonso VI. 
(1656-1683), who was then aged thirteen. During the king's 
minority the queen-mother, D. Luiza, acted as regent. She 
prosecuted the war with vigour, and on the 14th of January 1659 
a Portuguese army commanded by D. Antonio Luiz de Menezes, 
count of Cantanhede, defeated the Spaniards under D. Luiz de 
Haro at Elvas. In March 1659, however, the war between 
France and Spain was ended by the treaty of the Pyrenees; and 
D. Luiz de Haro, acting as the Spanish plenipotentiary, obtained 
the inclusion in the treaty of a secret article by which France 
undertook to give no further aid to Portugal. Neither Louis 
XIV. nor Mazarin desired the aggrandisement of Spain at the 
expense of their own ally; they therefore evaded the secret article 
by sending Marshal Schomberg to reorganize the Portuguese 
army (1660), and by helping forward a marriage between 
Charles II. of England and Catherine of Braganza, the sister 
of Alphonso VI. This project had been already mooted by 
D. Luiza, who had foreseen the restoration of the Stuart 
monarchy, and had in 1650 welcomed the exiled princes 
Rupert and Maurice at the court of John IV. The dowry to 
be paid by Portugal was fixed at £500,000 and the cession to 
Great Britain of Bombay and Tangier. In May 1663 the 
marriage was celebrated, and thus Great Britain took the 
place of France as the active ally of Portugal. 

Meanwhile, on the 20th of June 1662, the regency had been 
terminated by a palace revolution. Alphonso VI. declared 
himself of age and seized the royal authority; D. schomberg 
Luiza retired to a convent. The king was feeble and Casteiio 
and vicious, but \ had wit enough to leave the Methor > 
conduct of affairs to stronger hands. D. Luiz de Sousa e 
Vasconcellos, count of Casteiio Melhor, directed the policy of the 
nation while Schomberg took charge of its defence. The army, 
reinforced by British troops under the earl of Inchiquin and by 
French and German volunteers or mercenaries, was led in the 
field by Portuguese generals, who successfully carried out the 
plans of Schomberg. On the 8th of June 1663 the count of 
Villa Flor utterly defeated D. John of Austria, and retook Evora, 
which had been captured by the invaders; on the 7th of July 
1664 Pedro de Magalhaes defeated the duke of Osuna at Ciudad 
Rodrigo; on the 17th of June 1665 the marquess of Marialva 
destroyed a Spanish army led by the marquess of Carracena at 
the battle of Montes Claros, and Christovao de Brito Pereira 
followed up this victory with another at Villa Vicosa. The 
Spaniards failed to gain any compensating advantage, and on 
the 13th of February 1668 peace was concluded at Lisbon, Spain 
at last consenting to recognize the independence of the Portuguese 
kingdom. 

The signature of the treaty of Lisbon had been preceded by 
another palace revolution. Casteiio Melhor, hoping to secure 
further French support for his country, had arranged a marriage 
between Alphonso VI. and Marie Francoise Elisabeth, daughter of 
Charles Amadeus of Nemours, and grand-daughter of Henry IV. 
of France. The marriage, celebrated in 1666, caused the down- 
fall both of Casteiio Melhor and of the king. Queen Marie 
detested Alphonso and fell in love with his brother D. Pedro; 
and after four months of a hated union she left the palace and 
applied to the chapter of Lisbon cathedral to annul her marriage 
on the ground of non-consummation. D. Pedro imprisoned 
the king and assumed the regency; on the 1st of January 1668 
his authority was recognized by the cortes; on the 24th of March 
the annulment of the queen's marriage was pronounced and 
confirmed by the pope; on the 2nd of April she married the 
regent. Casteiio Melhor was permitted to escape to France, while 
Alphonso VI. was banished to Terceira in the Azores. A 
conspiracy to restore him to the thrcne was discovered in 1674, 
and he was removed to Cintra, where he died in 1683. 

Pedro II., who had acted as regent for fifteen years, now

became king. His reign (1683-1706) is a period of supreme 
importance in the economic and constitutional history of Por- 
The Cortes tugal. The goldfields of Minas Gcraes in Brazil, 
and the discovered about 1693, brought a vast revenue in 
Methuen rova ities to the Crown, which was thus enabled to 
Treaty. govern without summoning the cortes to vote supply. 
In 1697 the cortes met for the last time before the era of con- 
stitutional government. Even more important was the change 
effected when the Whig ministry of Great Britain sent John 
Methuen to Lisbon to negotiate a commercial agreement. The 
Methuen Treaty, signed on the 27th of December 1703, detached 
Portugal from the French alliance, and made her for more than 
150 years a commercial and political satellite of Great Britain. 
Its most far-reaching provisions were those which admitted 
Portuguese wines to the British market at a lower rate of duty 
than was imposed upon French and German wines, in return 
for a corresponding preference to English textiles. The demand 
for "Port" and "Madeira" was thus .artificially stimulated 
to such an extent that almost the whole productive energy of 
Portugal was concentrated upon the wine and cork trades. 
Other industries, including agriculture, were neglected, and 
even food-stuffs were imported from Great Britain. The 
disastrous economic results of the treaty were temporarily 
concealed by the influx of gold from Brazil, the check upon 
emigration from the wine-growing northern provinces, and the 
military advantages of alliance with Great Britain. Nor was 
the virtual abolition of the cortes seriously felt at first, owing 
to the excellent internal administration of Pedro II. and his 
minister the duke of Cadaval. 

Pedro II. had at first wished to remain neutral in the impend- 
ing struggle between Philip V. and the archduke Charles, rival 
War of the claimants for the throne of Spain. B ut Queen 
Spanish Marie had died in 1683, and in 1687 Cadaval had 
Succession, induced the king to marry Maria Sophia de Neuberg, 
daughter of the elector-palatine. Louis XIV. of France, who 
had hoped through the influence of Queen Marie to secure 
Portuguese support for his own grandson Philip V., realized that 
this second marriage might thwart his policy, and strove to 
redress the balance by creating a strong party at the court of 
Lisbon. He so far succeeded that in 1700 Pedro II. recognized 
Philip V. as king of Spain and in 170 1 protected a French fleet 
in the Tagus against the British. It was this incident that caused 
the despatch of the Methuen mission and the renewal of the 
Anglo-Portuguese alliance in 1703. On the 7 th of March 1704 a 
British fleet under Sir George Rooke reached Lisbon, convoying 
the archduke Charles and 10,000 British troops, who were 
joined by a Portuguese army under D. Joao de Sousa, marquess 
das Minas, and at once invaded Spain. (For the campaigns of 
1704-13, see Spanish Succession, War of the.) In 1705 
Pedro II. was compelled by failing health to appoint a regent, 
and chose his sister, Catherine of Braganza, queen-dowager of 
England. On the death of the king (Dec. 9, 1706) Cadaval 
arranged a marriage between his successor John V. (1706- 
1750) and the archduchess Marianna, sister of the archduke 
Charles, thus binding Portugal more closely to the Anglo- 
Austrian cause. The strain of the war was acutely felt in 
Portugal, especially in 1711, when the French admiral Duguay- 
Trouin sacked Rio de Janeiro and cut off the Brazilian treasure- 
ships. At last, on the 6th of February 1715, nearly two years 
after the treaty of Utrecht K peace between Spain and Portugal 
was concluded at Madrid. 

Never was the Portuguese Crown richer than in the years 
1715-1755; rarely had the kingdom prospered less. The 
The Mob- commercial and financial evils rife under the last 
*ft C ^ Mrf ^ n ^ s °* ^e Aviz dynasty were now repeated. 
i e wrcA *More gold had been discovered in Matto Grosso, 
diamonds in Minas Geraes. As in the 16th century immense 
quantities of bullion were imported by the treasury, and were 
lavished upon war, luxury and the Church, while agriculture 
and manufactures continued to decline, and the countryside was 
depopulated by emigration to Brazil. John V. was a spendthrift 
and a bigot. He gave and lent enormous sums to successive 



popes, and at the bidding of Clement XI. he joined a " crusade " 
against the Turks in which his ships helped to win a naval 
action off Cape Matapan (1717). For these services he received 
the title of Fidelisstmus, "Most Faithful"; "Majesty" had 
already been adopted by John IV. instead of the medieval 
" Highness," and the new style was intended to place the king of 
Portugal on an equality with his Most Christian Majesty of 
France and his Most Catholic Majesty of Spain. John V. was 
also empowered to create a multitude of new ecclesiastical 
dignities, and the archbishop of Lisbon was granted the rank and 
style of Patriarch ex officio. To the patriarchate was appended 
a Sacred College of 24 prelates, who were privileged to officiate 
in the scarlet robes of cardinals, while the patriarch wore the 
vestments of a second pope. Though regiments were disbanded, 
fleets put out of commission and fortresses dismantled to save 
the cost of their upkeep, the Crown paid nearly £100,000 yearly 
for the maintenance of this new hierarchy, and squandered 
untold wealth on the erection of churches and monasteries. In 
the church of Sao Roque in Lisbon, the decoration of a single 
chapel measuring 17 ft. by 12 ft. cost £225,000; the expenditure 
on the convent-palace of Mafra (q.v.) exceeded £4,000,000. 

John V. was succeeded by his son Joseph (1 750-1777). Five 
years afterwards Portugal was overtaken by the tremendous 
disaster of the Lisbon earthquake (see Lisbon), which, as Oliveira 
Martins justly observes, was " more than a cataclysm of nature; 
it was a moral revolution." It brought the Restoration period 
to an end (1755). Throughout that period the monarchy had 
occupied a precarious position, dependent until 1668 for its 
very existence, and after 1668 for its stability, on foreign support. 
Its policy had been moulded to suit France or Great Britain, 
while its internal administration had normally been directed 
by the Church. The cortes had grown obsolete; the feudal 
aristocracy were become courtiers. Once more, as in 1580, 
Portugal was governed by ecclesiastics in the name of an absolute 
monarch; once more, as in 1580, the chief strength of the ecclesi- 
astical party was the Society of Jesus, which still controlled the 
conscience and mind of the nation and of its nominal rulers, 
through the confessional and the schools. 

7. The Reform of the Monarchy: 1755-1826. — The unity of 
Portuguese history is hard to perceive in the .years which 
witnessed the rise and fall of the Pombaline regime, the reign of 
the mad queen Maria, the Peninsular War and the subsequent 
chaos of revolutionary intrigue. At first sight it seems absurd 
to characterize this period of despotism ending in war, ruin and 
anarchy as a period of reform. Nevertheless, it is possible 
to trace through the apparent chaos an uninterrupted move- 
ment from absolutism to representative institutions. Pombal 
liberated the monarchy from clerical domination, and thus 
unwittingly opened the door to those " French principles," 
or democratic ideas, which spread rapidly after his downfall in 
1777. The destruction of an obsolete poUtical system, begun 
by Pombal, was completed by the Peninsular War; while French 
invaders and British governors together quickened among the 
Portuguese a new consciousness of their nationality, and a new 
desire for poUtical rights, which rendered inevitable the change 
to constitutional monarchy. 

Two days after the accession of King Joseph, Sebastiao Jos6 de 
Carvalho e Mello, better known as the marquess of Pombal (q.v.), 
was appointed secretary of state for foreign affairs 
and war. In a few months he gained an ascendancy ^^fjjfl- 
over the king's mind which lasted until the end of the 
reign, and was strengthened by the courage and wisdom shown 
by Pombal at the time of the great earthquake. His policy 
was to strengthen the monarchy and to use it for the furtherance 
of a comprehensive scheme of reform. Beginning with finance 
and commerce, he reversed the bullionist policy of his predeces- 
sors and reorganized the entire system of taxation. He sought 
to undo the worst consequences of the Methuen treaty by the 
creation of national industries, establishing a gunpowder factory 
and a sugar refinery in 1751, a silk industry in 1752, wool, paper 
and glass factories after 1759. Colonial development was 
fostered, and the commercial dependence of Portugal upon

PORTUGAL 



[HISTORY 



Great Britain was reduced, by the formation of chartered 
companies, the first of which (1753) was given control of the 
Algarve sardine and tunny fisheries. The Oldembourg Company 
(i7S4) received a monopoly of trade with the Portuguese colonies 
in the East; extensive monopolist rights were also conceded to 
the Para and Maranhao Company (1755) arid the Pernambuco 
and Parahyba Company (1759). In Lisbon a chamber of com- 
merce {Junta do commercio) was organized in 1756 to replace an 
older association of merchants, the Meza dos hotnens de negocio, 
which had attacked the Pari Company; and in the same year the 
Alto Douro Company was formed to control the port-wine trade 
and to break the monopoly enjoyed by a syndicate of British 
wine merchants. This company met with strong opposition, 
culminating in a rising at Oporto (February 1757), which was 
savagely suppressed. 

Both his commercial policy and his desire to strengthen the 
Crown brought Pombal into conflict with the Church and the 
aristocracy. In 175 1 he had made all sentences passed by the 
Inquisition subject to revision by the Crown. The liberation 
of all slaves in Para and Maranhao except negroes (1755), and the 
creation of the Para Company, were prejudicial to the interests 
of the Jesuits, whose administrative authority over the Indians 
of Brazil was also curtailed. Various charges were brought 
against the Society by Pombal, and in September 1759, after 
five years of heated controversy (see Jesuits), he published a 
decree of expulsion against all its members in the Portuguese 
dominions. His power at court had previously been strengthened 
by the so-called Tavora plot. The marquess and marchioness 
of Tavora and their two sons, with the duke of Aveiro, the count 
of Atouguia and other' noblemen, were accused of complicity 
in an attempt upon the life of King Joseph (September 1758). 
Pombal appointed a special tribunal to judge the case; many of 
the accused, including those already mentioned, were found 
guilty and executed; and an attempt was made to implicate 
the Jesuits. Pombars enemies declared that he himself had 
organized the attack upon the king, in such a manner as to throw 
suspicion upon his political opponents and to gain credit for 
himself. This accusation was not proved, but the history of the 
Tavora plot remains extremely obscure. The expulsion of the 
Jesuits involved Portugal in a dispute with Pope Clement XIII.; 
in June 1760 the papal nuncio was ordered to leave Lisbon, and 
diplomatic relations with the Vatican were only resumed after the 
condemnation of the Jesuits by Clement XIV., in July 1773. 

His victory over the Jesuits left Pombal free to develop his 
plans for reform. He devoted himself especially to education 
and defence. A school of commerce was founded in 1759; in 
1760 the censorship of books was transferred from an ecclesi- 
astical to a lay tribunal; in 1761 the former Jesuit college in 
Lisbon was converted into a college for the sons of noblemen; 
in 1768 a royal printing-press was established; in 1772 Pombal 
provided for a complete system of primary and secondary educa- 
tion, entailing the foundation of 837 schools. He founded' a 
college of art in Mafra; he became visitor of Coimbra University, 
recast its statutes and introduced the teaching of natural science. 
Funds for these reforms were to a great extent provided out of 
the sequestrated property of the Jesuits; Pombal also effected 
great economies in internal administration. He abolished the 
distinction between Old and New Christians, and made all 
Portuguese subjects eligible to any office in the state. Far- 
reaching reforms were at the same time carried out in the army, 
navy and mercantile marine. In 1760 Admiral Boscawen had 
violated Portuguese neutrality by burning four French ships off 
Lagos; Pombal protested and the British government apologized, 
but not before the military weakness of Portugal had been 
demonstrated. Two years later, when the Family Compact 
involved Portugal in a war with Spain, Pombal called in Count 
William of Lippe-Biickeburg to reorganize the army, which was 
reinforced by a British contingent under Brigadier-General John 
Burgoyne, and was increased from 5006 to 50,000 men. The 
Spaniards were at first successful, and captured Braganza and 
Almeida; but they were subsequently defeated at Villa Velha 
and Valencia de Alcantara, and the Portuguese fully held their 



own up to the signature of peace at Fontainebleau, in February 
1763. Towards the close of the reign, a long-standing contro- 
versy with Spain as to the frontier between Brazil and the 
Spanish colonies threatened a renewal of the war; but in this 
crisis Pombal was deprived of power by the death of King 
Joseph (Feb. 20, 1777) and the accession of his daughter Maria I. 

The queen was married to her uncle, who became king consort 
as Pedro III. PombaTs dismissal, brought about by the 
influence of the queen-mother Mariana Victoria, Maria I., 
did not involve an immediate reversal of his policy. Pedro ///. 
The controversy with Spain was amicably settled and D.John. 
by the treaty of San Ildefonso (1777 )\ and further industrial 
and educational reforms were inaugurated, chief among them 
being the foundation, in 1780, of the Royal Academy of Sciences. 
Queen Maria, who had previously shown signs of religious mama, 
became wholly insane after 1788, owing to the deaths of Pedro 
III. (May 1786), of the crown prince D. Joseph, and of her con- 
fessor, the inquisitor-general D. Ignacio de San Caetano. Her 
second son, D. John, assumed the conduct of affairs in 1792, 
although he did not take the title of regent until 1799. Mean- 
while a two-fold reaction — on one side clericalist, on the other 
democratic — had set in against the reforms of Pombal. D.John 
told William Beckford in 1786 that "the kingdom belonged to 
the monks," and his consort Carlota Joaquina, daughter of 
Charles IV. of Spain, exercised a powerful influence in favour of 
the Church. But new ideas had been introduced with the new 
system of education, and the inevitable revolt against absolutism 
had resulted in the formation of a Radical party, which sympa- 
thized with the Revolution in France and carried' on an active 
propaganda through the numerous masonic lodges which were in 
fact political clubs. D. John became alarmed, and the intendant 
of police in Lisbon, D. Diogo Ignacio de Pina Manique, organized 
an elaborate system of espionage which led to the imprisonment 
or exile of many harmless enthusiasts. 

From similar motives, a treaty of alliance with Spain was 

signed at Aranjuez in March 1793; 5000 Portuguese troops were 

sent to assist in a Spanish invasion of France: a „ , ,,

the ally of Great Britain, was deliberately excluded. fi^fo 0tf 
In 1796 Spain declared war upon Great Britain, and in 
1797 a secret convention for the partition of Portugal was signed 
by the French ambassador in Madrid, General Perignon, and by 
the Spanish minister Godoy. D. John appealed for help to 
Great Britain, which sent him 6000 men, under Sir Charles Stuart, 
and a subsidy of £200,000. Though Spain, through the influence 
of D. John's father-in-law Charles IV., still remained neutral, 
a state of war between Portugal and France existed until 1799. 
D. John then reopened negotiations with Napoleon, and Lucien 
Bonaparte was sent to dictate terms in Madrid. But D. John 
dared not consent to close the harbours of Portugal against 
British ships. England was the chief market for Portuguese 
wine and grain; and the long Portuguese littoral w^as at the mercy 
of the British navy. Compelled to choose between fighting on 
land and fighting at sea, D. John rejected the demands of Lucien 
Bonaparte, and on the 10th of February 1801 declared war 
upon Spain. His territories were at once invaded by a Franco- 
Spanish army, and on the 6th of June 1801 he was forced to 
conclude the peace of Badajoz, by -which he ceded the frontier 
fortress of Olivenza to Spain, and undertook to pay 20,000,000 
francs to Napoleon and to exclude British ships from Portuguese 
ports. Napoleon was dissatisfied with these terms, and although 
he ultimately ratified the treaty, he sent General Lannes to 
Lisbon as his ambassador, instructing him to humiliate the 
Portuguese and if possible to goad them into a renewal of the 
war. The same policy was continued by General Junot, who 
succeeded Lannes in 1804. Junot required D. John to declare 
war upon Great Britain, but this demand was not immediately 
pressed owing to the preoccupation of Napoleon with greater 
affairs, and in October 1805 Junot left Portugal. 
By his Berlin decree of the 21st of November 1806 Napoleon

to Louis II. of Etruria in exchange for his Italian kingdom; 
Algarvc and Alemtejo were to form a separate principality for 
Godoy ; the remaining provinces were to be garrisoned by French 
troops until a general peace should be concluded. To give effect 
to these terms, General Junot hastened westward across Spain, 
at the head of 30,000 French soldiers and a large body of 
Spanish auxiliaries. So rapid were his movements that there 
was no time to organize effective resistance. On the 29th of 
November D. John, acting on the advice of Sir Sidney Smith, 
British naval commander in the Tagus, appointed a council of 
regency and sailed for Brazil, convoyed by Sir Sidney Smith's 
squadron. For a detailed account of the subsequent military 
operations, see Peninsular War. 

Junot, who was everywhere well received by the Portuguese 
democrats, entered Lisbon at the end of November 1807. He 
assumed command of the Portuguese army, divided 
jjnou** Y tne kingdom into military governments, and, on the 
November 1st of February 1808 announced that the Braganza 
1807- dynasty had forfeited its right to the throne. He him- 

«o# /S ' se ^ h°P e( l t0 succeed D.John, and sought to conciliate 
the Portuguese by reducing the requisition demanded 
by Napoleon from 40,000,000 francs to 20,000,000. But the 
action of the French troops in occupying the fortresses of northern 
Spain provoked in May 1808 a general rising in that country, 
which soon spread to Portugal. The Spanish garrison in Oporto 
expelled the French governor and declared for the Braganzas, 
compelling Junot to march towards the north. He left Lisbon 
under the control of a regency, headed by the bishopof Oporto, 
who applied to Great Britain for help, promoted an insurrection 
against the French, and organized juntas (committees) of 
government in the larger towns. On the 1st of August 1808 
Sir Arthur Welleslcy, with 9000 British troops, landed at 
Figueira da Foz. He defeated a French division at Rolica 
(" Roleia ") on the 17th, and on the 21st won a victory over 
Junot at Vimeiro ("Vimiera"). Fearing an attack by Portu- 
guese auxiliaries and the arrival of British reinforcements under 
Sir John Moore, Junot signed the convention of Cintra by which, 
on the 30th of August 1808, he agreed to evacuate Portugal 
(sec Wellington). The regency appointed by D. John was 
now reconstituted and in October Sir John Moore assumed 
command of all the allied troops in Portugal. From Lisbon 
Moore marched north-eastward with about 32,000 men to assist 
the Spanish armies against Napoleon; his subsequent retreat 
to join Sir David Baird in Galicia, in January 1809, diverted 
the pursuing army under Napoleon to the north-west, and 
temporarily saved Portugal from attack. 

In February Major-General William Carr Beresford was 
given command of the Portuguese army. Organized and 
invasion by disciplined by British officers, the native troops played 
Souit, a gallant part in the subsequent campaigns. In 

March-May March 1809 the second invasion of Portugal began; 
,809 ' Soult crossed the Galician frontier and captured 

Oporto, while an auxiliary force under General Lapisse advanced 
from Salamanca. On the 22nd of April, however, Wellesley, 
who had been recalled after the convention of Cintra, landed in 
Lisbon. On the 12th of May he forced the passage of the 
Douro, subsequently retaking Oporto and pursuing Soult into 
Spain. Valuable assistance had been rendered by the Portu- 
guese generals Antonio da Silveira and Manoel de Brito 
Mousinho — the first a leader, the second an organizer. 

After the battle of Wagram (July 6, 1809) the French 
armies in the Peninsula received large reinforcements, and 
invasion ^Marshal MassSna, with 120,000 men, was ordered 
Mdssena, to operate against Portugal. He crossed the frontier 
June 1810- in June 1810 and besieged Almeida, which capitu- 
Apniwi. lated on the 27th of August> Wellesley, who had 

now become Viscount Wellington, opposed his march south- 



wards, and won a victory at Bussaco on the 27th of September; 
but Masscna subsequently turned the position of the allied army 
on the Serra de Bussaco, and caused Wellington to fall back 
upon the fortified lines which he had already constructed at 
Torres Vcdras. Here he stood upon the defensive until the 
invaders should be defeated by starvation. The Portuguese 
troops cut MassSna's communications; the peasants, under 
instructions from Wellington, had already laid waste their own 
farms, destroyed the roads and bridges by which Mass6na might 
retreat, and burned their boats on the Tagus. On the 5th of 
March 181 1, after a winter of terrible sufferings, MassSna's 
retreat began; he was harassed*by-the allied troops all the way 
to Sabugal, where the last rearguard action in Portugal took 
place on the 3rd of April. The invaders retired with a loss of 
nearly 30,000 men; Almeida was retaken on the 6th; and the 
remainder of the war was fought out on Spanish and French 
soil. The Portuguese troops remained under Wellington's 
command until 18 14, and distinguished themselves in many 
actions, notably at Salamanca and on the Nivelle. 

At the congress of Vienna (181 4-1 8 1 5) Portugal was represented 
by three plenipotentiaries, who were instructed to press for the 
retrocession of Olivenza and to oppose the restora- 
tion of French Guiana, which the Brazilians had th^Wan 
conquered in 1809. Neither object was attained; 
and this failure, which was attributed to the lack of British 
support, hastened the reaction against British influence 
which had already begun. Since 1808 Portugal had theoretic- 
ally been governed by the regency representing D. John. 
But as the regency was corrupt and unable to co-operate with 
Wellington and Beresford, the British government had demanded 
that Sir Charles Stuart (son of the Sir Charles Stuart mentioned 
above) should be appointed one of its members. The real 
control of affairs soon afterwards passed into the strong hands of 
Stuart and Beresford; and while the war lasted the Portuguese 
acquiesced in what was in fact an autocracy exercised by 
foreigners. In 181 5, however, they desired to resume their 
independence. A further cause of dissatisfaction was the mutual 
jealousy of Portugal and Brazil. The colony claimed as high 
a political status as the mother-country, and by a decree dated 
the 1 6th of January 1815 it was raised to the rank of a separate 
kingdom. Thenceforward, until 1822, the Portuguese sover- 
eignty was styled the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and 
the Algarves. The importance of this change hecame apparent 
when Queen Maria I. died (March 1816) and D. John succeeded 
to the united thrones as John VI. The king refused to leave 
Brazil, partly owing to the intrigues of Carlota Joaquina, who 
hoped to become queen of an independent Brazilian kingdom. 
Thus Portugal, which had been almost ruined by the war, was 
now humiliated by the failure of her diplomacy at Vienna and 
by her continued dependence upon Great Britain and Brazil. 
The resultant discontent found expression in the cry of " Por- 
tugal for the Portuguese " and in the demand for a constitution. 

In 181 7 a military revolt (pronunciamento) in Lisbon was 
crushed by Beresford, and the leader, General Gomes Freire de 
Andrade, was executed; hut on the 16th of August j ne con' 
1820, after Beresford had sailed to Brazil to secure stltutlonai 
the return of John VI., a second rising took place Movement, 
in Oporto. It soon spread southward. A new I820 ~ 1S26 * 
council of regency was established in Lishon, the British officers 
were expelled from the army; Beresford, on his return from 
Brazil, was not permitted to land; a constituent assemhly was 
summoned. This body suppressed the Inquisition and drew 
up a highly democratic constitution, by which all citizens were 
declared equal before the law and eligible to any office; all class 
privileges were abolished, the liberty of the Press was guaranteed, 
and the government of the country was vested in a single 
chamber, subject only to the suspensive veto of the Crown. 
So extreme a change was disliked by most of the powers and 
by many Portuguese, especially those of the clerical party. 
Great Britain insisted on the return of John VI., who entrusted 
the government of Brazil to his elder son D. Pedro and landed 
in Portugal on the 3rd of July 1821. In 1822, on the advice of

[HISTORY 



D. Pedro, he swore to obey the constitution (thenceforward 
known as the " constitution of 1822 "). But his younger son, 
D. Miguel, and the queen, Carlo ta Joaquina, refused to take the 
oath; and in December 1822 sentence of banishment was pro- 
nounced against them, though not enforced. They had many 
supporters at home and abroad. French troops had invaded 
Spain in the interests of Ferdinand VII. (1823), and the French 
government was prepared to countenance the absolutist 
party in Portugal in order to check British influence there. 
Another military revolt broke out in Traz-os-Montes on the 3rd 
of February 1823, its leader being the count of Amarante, who 
was opposed to the constitution. D. Miguel appealed to the 
army to " restore liberty to their king/' and the army, incensed 
by the loss of Brazil (1822), gave him almost unanimous support. 
At this juncture John VI., vainly seeking for a compromise, 
abrogated the constitution of 1822, but appointed as his minister 
D. Pedro de Sousa Holstein, count (afterwards duke) of Palmella 
and leader of the " English " or constitutional party. These 
half-measures did not satisfy D. Miguel, whose soldiers seized 
the royal palace in Lisbon on the 30th of April 1824. Palmella 
was arrested, and John VI. forced to take refuge on the British 
flagship in the Tagus. But the united action of the foreign 
ministers restored the king and reinstated Palmella; the insur- 
rection was crushed; D. Miguel submitted and went into exile 
(June 1824). 

In Brazil also a revolution had taken place. The Brazilians 
demanded complete independence, and D. Pedro sided with 
them. The Portuguese garrison of Rio de Janeiro was over- 
powered; on the 7th of September 1822 D. Pedro declared the 
country independent, and on the 12th of October he was pro- 
claimed constitutional emperor. He took no notice of the 
constituent assembly in Lisbon, which on the 19th of September 
had ordered him to return to Portugal on pain of forfeiting 
his right to inherit the Portuguese Crown. By the end of 1823 
all Portuguese resistance to the new regime in Brazil had been 
overcome. 

John VI. died on the 10th of March 1826, leaving (by will) 
his daughter D. Isabel Maria as regent for Pedro I. of Brazil, 
who now became Pedro IV. of Portugal. A crisis was evidently 
imminent, for Portugal would not tolerate an absentee sovereign 
who was far more Brazilian than Portuguese, The unsatisfied 
ambition of Carlota Joaquina and the hostility between abso- 
lutists and constitutionalists might at any moment precipitate 
a civil war. To conciliate the Portuguese, Pedro IV. drew up 
a charter (known as the " charter of 1826 ") which provided 
for moderate parliamentary government on the British model. 
To conciliate the Brazilians, he undertook (by decree dated May 
2nd 1826) to surrender the Portuguese Crown to his daughter D. 
Maria da Gloria (then aged seven) ; but this abdication was made 
contingent upon her marriage with her uncle D. Miguel, who was 
first required to swear fidelity to the charter. 

8. Constitutional Government. — The charter of 1826 forms the 
basis of the present Portuguese constitution and the starting- 
point of modern Portuguese history. That history comprises 
four periods: (a) From 1826 to 1834 the clerical and absolutist 
parties led by D. Miguel united every reactionary element 
throughout the kingdom in a last unsuccessful stand against 
constitutional government; (b) From 1834 to 1853 the main 
problem for Portuguese statesmen was whether the constitution, 
now accepted as inevitable, should embody the radical ideas of 
1822 or the moderate ideas of 1826; (c) From 1853 to 1889 
there was a period of transition marked by the rise of three new 
parties — Progressive, Regenerator, Republican; (d) From 1889 
to 1908 the Progressives and Regenerators monopolized the 
control of public affairs, but the strength of Republicanism was 
not to be gauged by its representation in the cortes. At the 
beginning of the 20th century the question whether the monarchy 
should be replaced by a republic had become a living political 
issue, which was decided by the revolution of October 5, 1910. 

The charter was brought to Lisbon by Sir Charles Stuart 
in July 1826. The absolutists had hoped that D. Pedro would 
abdicate unconditionally in favour of D. Miguel, and the council 



of regency at first refused to publish the charter. They were 
forced to do so (July 12) by a pronunciamento issued by D. 
Joao Carlos de Saldanha de Oliveira e Daun, count The 
of Saldanha and commander of the army in Oporto. Absolutist 
Saldanha, a prominent constitutionalist, threatened Reactioa * 
to march on Lisbon if the regency did not swear obedience to* 
the charter by the 31st of July. Amid wild enthusiasm the 
charter was proclaimed on that day, and on the 3rd of August 
Saldanha became head of a Liberal ministry. An absolutist 
counter-revolution at once broke out in the north. It was 
organized by the marquess of Chaves, and supported openly by 
the Church and the Miguelite majority of the army; secret 
assistance was also given, by Spain. As civil war appeared 
imminent, Canning despatched 5000 British troops under Sir 
William Clinton to restore order, and to disband the troops 
under Chaves. By March 1827 Clinton and Saldanha had 
secured the acceptance of the charter throughout Portugal. 

In October 1826 D. Miguel also swore to obey the charter 
and was betrothed to his niece D. Maria da Gloria (Maria II.). 
Pedro IV. appointed him regent in July 1827 and in February 
1828 he landed in Lisbon, where he was received with cries of 
" Viva D. Miguel I., rei absoluto! " In March he dissolved the 
parliament which had met in accordance with the charter. In 
April the Tory ministry under Wellington withdrew Clinton's 
division, which was the mainstay of the charter. In May D. 
Miguel summoned a cortes of the ancient type, which offered him 
the Crown; and on the 7th of July 1828 he took the oath as king. 
Saldanha, Palmella, the count of Villa Flor (afterwards duke of 
Terceira), and the other constitutionalist leaders were driven 
into exile, while scores of their adherents were executed and thou- 
sands imprisoned. Austria and Spain supported D. Miguel, 
who was able to dispose of the vast wealth of Carlota Joaquina; 
Great Britain and France remained neutral. Only the emperor 
D. Pedro and a handful of exiles upheld the cause of Maria II. , 
who returned to Brazil in 1829. 

The Azores, although the majority of their inhabitants 
favoured absolutism, now became a centre of resistance to 
D. Miguel. In 1828 the garrison of Angra declared The 
for Maria II., endured a siege lasting four months, Miguetite 
and finally took refuge in the island of Terceira, Wars. 
where it was reinforced by volunteers from Brazil and constitu- 
tionalist refugees from England and France. In March 1820 
Palmella established a regency on the island, on behalf of 
Maria II.; and D. Miguel's fleet was defeated in Praia Bay on 
the 1 2th of August. Fortune played into the hands of Palmella, 
Saldanha, Villa Flor and their followers in Terceira. In 183c* 
a Whig ministry came into office in Great Britain; the "July 
revolution " placed Louis Philippe on the throne of France; 
Carlota Joaquina, the power behind D. Miguel's throne, died on 
the 7th of January. The fanaticism of the clerical and abso- 
lutist parties in Portugal (collectively termed apostolicos) was 
enhanced by recrudescence of Sebastianism. Men saw in the 
brutal boor D. Miguel (q.v.) a personification of the hero-king 
Sebastian, whose second advent had been expected for two 
and a half centuries. In the orgy of persecution, outrages were 
committed on British and French subjects; and a French squad- 
ron retaliated- by seizing D. Miguel's fleet in the Tagus (July 
183 1). In Brazil, D. Pedro abdicated (April 183 1); he deter- 
mined to return to Europe and conduct in person a campaign 
for the restoration of Maria II. He was received with enthusiasm 
by Louis Philippe. In Great Britain Palmella raised a loan of 
£2,000,000 and purchased a small fleet, of which Captain Sartor- 
ius, a retired British naval officer, was appointed admiral. In 
February 1832 the "Liberators," as they were styled, sailed 
from Belleisle to the Azores, with D. Pedro aboard the flagship. 
In July they reached Portugal and occupied Oporto, but the 
expected constitutionalist rising did not take place. The 
country was almost unanimous in its loyalty to D. Miguel, who 
had 80,000 troops against the 6500 (including 500 French and 
300 British) of D. Pedro. But the Miguelites had no navy, 
and no competent general. They besieged D. Pedro in Oporto 
from July 1832 to July 1833, when the duke of Terceira and

Captain Charles Napier, who had succeeded Sartorius, effected 
a daring and successful diversion which resulted in the capture 
of Lisbon^ (July 2 4» l $33)* Maria II. arrived from France in 
September. The war went in her favour, largely owing to the 
brilliant generalship of Saldanha and the financial straits to 
which D. Miguel was reduced. In April 1834 a Quadruple 
Alliance was concluded between France, Spain, Great Britain 
and the government of Maria II. The allied army defeated the 
Miguelitcs at Asseiceira on the 16th of May, and D. Miguel 
surrendered at Evora-Monte on the 24th. By the convention 
of Evora-Monte he was condemned to perpetual banishment 
from the Peninsula. On the 24th of September D. Pedro died. 
During the few months in which he acted as regent for his 
daughter, he had transformed Portugal from a semi-feudal into 
a modern state. Tithes, many hereditary privileges and all 
monopolies were abolished; every convent was closed and its 
property nationalized; the Jesuits, who had returned after the 
death of Pombal, were again expelled; the charter of 1826 was 
restored. 

Maria II. was fifteen years old at her accession. She was 
twice married — in December 1834 to Augustus, duke of Leuch- 

tenberg, who died four months afterwards; and in 
183^1853. April 1836 to Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, who received 

the title of king consort in September 1837. Both 
the queen and the king consort were strangers to Portugal, 
and could exercise little control over the turbulent factions 
whose intrigues and pronunciameiitos made orderly govern- 
ment impossible. There were three political parties: the 
Miguelites, who were still strong enough to cause trouble; 
the Chartists, who advocated the principles of 1826; the 
Septembrists, who advocated those of 1822 and took their name 
from the successful coup d'itat of the gth-nth of September 
1836. By this coiip d Hat the constitution of 1822 was sub- 
stituted for the charter of 1826; and a Septembrist ministry 
under the Viscount Sa da Bandeira replaced the Chartist 
ministry under Saldanha, Terceira and Palmella. A counter- 
revolution, planned in the royal palace at Belem and hence 
known as the Belemzada, was frustrated in November 1836; 
and in 1837 a Chartist insurrection was crushed after severe 
fighting. This was known as the " War of the Marshals, " from 
the rank of the two Chartist leaders, Saldanha and Terceira. 
In 1839 a moderate ministry took office, with Antonio Bermudo 
da Costa Cahral as its real, though not its ostensible, head. A 
pronunciamento by Costa Cabral led to the restoration of the 
charter on the 10th of February 1842, and a Cahral government 
was formed under the nominal leadership of Terceira. Costa 
Cabral, who became count of Thomar in 1845, ruled despotically, 
despite many insurrections, until May 1846, when a coalition 
of Miguelites, Septembrists and Chartist malcontents drove 
him into exile. On this occasion the rebellion — known as the 
" War of Maria da Fonte " — proved formidable. Oporto was 
held by a revolutionary junta, and Saldanha, who had become 
prime minister, persuaded the Quadruple Alliance to intervene. 
In June 1847 the Oporto junta surrendered, under promise of an 
amnesty, to a combined British and Spanish force, and the 
convention of Gramido (July 24, 1847) ended the war. Saldanha 
was rewarded with a dukedom, and retained office until June 
1849. The dictatorial rule of his successor — the returned 
exile, Thomar — provoked another successful rising on the 7th 
of April 185 1. Thomar again fled from the country; Saldanha 
again became prime minister, but at the head of a moderate 
coalition. He remained in power during five years of unbroken 
peace (1851-1856), and carried many useful reforms. The 
most important of these was the so-called Additional Act of the 
5th of July 1852, which amended the charter of 1826 by pro- 
viding for the direct election of deputies, the decent ralization 
of the executive, the creation of representative municipal 
councils, and the abolition of capital punishment for political 
offences. Maria II. died on the 13th of November 1853, and was 
succeeded by her eldest son D. Pedro, during whose ministry 
the king consort D. Ferdinand acted as regent. 

Under the brothers Pedro V. (1853-1861) and Luiz (1861- 



1889) Portugal obtained a respite from civil strife. Both 
monarchs delegated the conduct of affairs to their ministers, 
who constructed new railways, reformed the edu- 
cational system, and gradually improved the economic ^J^uiL 
condition of the kingdom and its colonies. Pedro V. 
came of age and assumed the government on the 16th of 
November 1855, in 1857 he married Princess Stephanie of 
Hohenzollern. The only political disturbance which marred 
the peace of his reign arose out of the seizure of the "Charles 
ct Georges," a French slave-trader which was captured off 
Mozambique. Napoleon III. sent a fleet to the Tagus and 
demanded an indemnity, which Portugal was compelled to pay. 
In 1 860-1 861 cholera ravaged the whole kingdom, and especially 
the capital. The king died of this disease on the nth of 
November i86r, and two of his brothers, D. Ferdinand and 
D. John, died shortly afterwards. D. Luiz was absent at the 
time, and his father D. Ferdinand again became regent until 
his return, soon after which (1862) the new king married Maria 
Pia, daughter of Victor Emanuel II. of Italy. In 1869 slavery 
was abolished in every Portuguese colony. In 1870 the duke 
of Saldanha, the last survivor of the turbulent statesmen of 
Queen Maria's reign, threatened an appeal to arms if the king 
would not dismiss his minister, the duke of Louie, an advanced 
Radical and freemason, whose influence, dating from the reign 
of Pedro V., was viewed with disfavour by Saldanha, as well 
as by more conservative politicians. The king yielded; and 
Saldanha himself became prime minister, retaining office until 
1874, when, aj; the. age of 80, he was sent as ambassador to 
London. He had been by far the most influential man in 
Portugal, and his death in 1876 was followed by a regrouping 
of political parties. 

The party of the Regenerators (Regetieradores), formed in 
1852 out of a coalition of Septembrists and Chartists, had 
already been disintegrated. Its more radical ele- 
ments, known at first as the Historic Left, were in p&rttes. 
1877 reorganized as the Progressives (Progressislas). 
Its more conservative elements carried on the tradition 
and retained the name of the original Regenerators. Besides 
these two monarchist parties — the Regenerators or Conser- 
vative right and the Progressives or Constitutional left — a 
strong Republican party was formed in 1881. There were 
also the Miguelites, active but impotent intriguers; and the 
advocates of Iberian union, who became prominent in 1867, 
1869, 1874, and especially in July 1872, when many well- 
known politicians were implicated in a fantastic conspiracy 
for the establishment of an Iberian republic. Portuguese 
nationalism was too strong for these advocates of union 
with Spain, whose propaganda was discredited as soon as 
any national interest was seriously endangered- This was 
the case in 1872, when Great Britain claimed the southern 
part of Delagoa Bay. The claim was submitted to the arbitra- 
tion of M. Thiers, the French president, whose successor, 
Marshal Macmahon, delivered an award in favour of Portugal 
on the 19th of April 1875 (see Delagoa Bay). 

King Luiz died on the 19th of October 1889, and was succeeded 
by his son D. Carlos (q.v.). Colonial affairs had for some time 
received close attention. In 1885 Portugal recog- c^^/ 
nized the Congo Free State, and admitted its Affairs; 
sovereignty over the north bank of the Lower Retatloas 
Congo, although, in an unratified treaty of 1884, wlih <&*«' 
Great Britain had recognized both hanks of the Briubt * 
river as Portuguese territory. In 1886 Germany, France and 
Portugal defined by treaty the limits of their adjacent spheres 
of influence, and on the 26th of March 1887 Macao, hitherto 
leased to Portugal, was formally ceded by the Chinese 
government. In 1889 a resolution unanimously adopted by 
both chambers invited the ministry, of which Jose* de Castro 
was president and Barros Gomes foreign minister, to press 
forward the territorial claims of Portugal in East and Central 
Africa. Shortly after the accession of King Carlos this active 
policy led to a dispute with Great Britain (see Africa, § 5). A 
Portuguese force under Major Serpa Pinto had invaded the 



154 



PORTUGAL 



[HISTORY 



Shire highlands in order to forestall their annexation by the 
British, and the British government demanded satisfaction. 
Public opinion rendered compliance difficult until a British 
squadron was despatched to the mouth of the Tagus, and the 
British minister presented an ultimatum (Jan. n, 1890), requiring 
the withdrawal of all Portuguese forces from the Shire. Barros 
Gomes was then able to yield under protest; but disturbances 
at once broke out in Lisbon and Oporto, and the ministry 
resigned. A coalition government took office on the 14th of 
January, with Serpa Pimentel as prime minister and J. Hintze- 
Ribeiro as foreign minister. The king, in a letter to Queen 
Victoria, declined for the time being to receive the Order of the 
Garter, which had just been offered him, and on the 6th of 
February the government addressed a circular letter to the 
powers, proposing to submit the issues in dispute to a European 
conference. Meanwhile a Republican rising was suppressed in 
Lisbon, and many suspected officers were degraded. On the 
20th of August an Anglo-Portuguese agreement was negotiated 
in London, but the cortes refused to ratify it. The ministry 
therefore resigned, and on the 14th of October Abreu c Sousa 
fomed a new cabinet, which arranged with Great Britain a 
modus vivendi for six months, pending the conclusion of another 
agreement. The British government was ready to make con- 
cessions, but more than one collision took place between Portu- 
guese troops in Manica and the forces of the British South Africa 
Company. The defeat of the Portuguese was the chief cause of 
a .serious military rising in Oporto, which broke out on the 30th 
of January 1891. The suppression of this rising so far enhanced 
the prestige of the cabinet that the cortes forthwith approved 
the convention with Great Britain; and the definitive treaty, 
by which Portugal abandoned all claim to a trans-African 
dominion, was ratified by the cortes on the 28th of May- Rela- 
tions with Great Britain, however, remained far from cordial 
until the celebration of the fourth centenary of Vasco da Gama's 
voyage to India afforded the opportunity for a rapprochement 
in 1898. 

The extravagant management of the railways guaranteed by 
the state had entailed such heavy deficits that the payment of 
Financial the coupon of the railway state loan, due on the 
crisis of 2nd of January 1892 had to be suspended. Thus 
l892 * arose a serious financial crisis, involving three changes 

of ministry. In May the Portuguese government committed 
a formal act of bankruptcy by issuing a decree reducing 
the amount then due to foreign bondholders by two-thirds. 
The bondholders' committees, supported by some of the 
powers concerned, protested against this illegal action. A 
compromise was at last arranged by Hintze-Ribeiro, who 
assumed office in February 1893 as head of a Progressive 
government. His cabinet promised only slightly better terms 
to the foreign bondholders, but it relieved the financial tension 
in some degree; and by coming to an agreement with Germany 
in East Africa and with Great Britain in South Africa as to 
the delimitation of frontiers, he minimized the risks of conflict 
with either country. 

Portugal observed neutrality on the outbreak of the Anglo- 
Boer War, but the permission it conceded to the British consul at 
Lourenco Marques to search for contraband of war among goods 
imported there, and the free passage accorded to an armed 
force under General Carrington from Beira through Portu- 
guese territory to Rhodesia, were vehemently attacked in the 
Press and at public meetings. The award of the Swiss arbi- 
trators in the matter of the Delagoa Bay railway was given in 
1900 (see LorjRENgo Marques). Portugal was condemned to 
pay 15,314,000 francs compensation; and this sum (less 
than was expected) was immediately raised by loan from the 
Portuguese Tobacco Company. 

A law of the 8th of August 1901 regulated the conditions of 
election to the lower house, thus ending a long series of parlia- 
mentary reforms. The most important of these had provided 
for the gradual extinction of the right of hereditary peers to sit 
in the upper house (July 24, 1885), had reduced the number of 
deputies and fixed the qualifications required for the exercise of 



the franchise (March 28, 1895); and had abolished the elective 
branch in the upper house (Sept. 25, 1895). These changes 
left untouched the most serious evil in Portuguese consti* 
public life. The two great parties, Progressives and tutionai 
Regenerators, were largely composed of professional Changes, 
politicians whose votes were determined by their i88S ~ i90i ' 
private interests. Skilful manipulation of the electoral returns 
enabled these two parties to hold office in fairly regular rota- 
tion; hence arose the popular nickname of rotativos, applied 
to Progressives and Regenerators alike. The same methods 
enabled them to obstruct the election of Republican and 
Independent candidates. 

Under such a system of government it was natural that 
economic issues should still dominate Portuguese politics at 
the beginning of the 20th century. Year by year Republican* 
the budget showed a deficit, and the indebtedness ism and 
of the state increased. A large proportion of the tneArtn y* 
expenditure was unproductive, corruption was rife in the public 
services, and the poverty of the overtaxed peasant and artisan 
classes gave rise to sporadic outbreaks of violence. In 1902 the 
students at Coimbra and Oporto organized an agitation against 
the proposed conversion of the gold debt; and anti-clerical 
riots, followed by a strike, rendered necessary the proclamation 
of martial law in Aveiro. In January 1903 an insurrection of 
peasants armed with scythes took place at Fundao; the imposi- 
tion of a new market tax provoked riots at Coimbra in March; 
a serious strike of weavers took place at Oporto in June. In 
the same, year the general distress was intensified by the failure 
of the Rural and Mortgage Bank of Brazil. In these circum- 
stances Republicanism rapidly gained ground. Its real strength 
was masked by the system which enabled any ministry in power 
to control the election of candidates to the cortes. In April 
r8o6, for example, only one Republican deputy was returned, 
although it was notorious that the Republican party could 
command a majority in many constituencies. Though the army 
as a whole was monarchist, certain regiments had become 
imbued with revolutionary ideals, which were fortified by the 
unwise employment of soldiers and sailors for the suppression 
of industrial disputes. During the weavers' strike the cruiser 
" Rainha. D. Amelia " was converted into a temporary prison, 
and at Fundao, Aveiro and elsewhere troops had been ordered 
to fire on men with whom they sympathized. In November 
1902, while King Carlos was in England, a military rising was 
organized in Oporto, but never took place. On the 23rd of 
April 1903 a body of cavalry and artillery mutinied in Lisbon 
and proclaimed a republic; but they were overpowered and 
ultimately transported to Mozambique. Such incidents, unim- 
portant in themselves, were symptoms of a dangerous state of 
public opinion, which was debarred from expression in the 
cortes. 

The constitution empowered the sovereign to veto any bill, 
to dissolve or prorogue the cortes, and to govern by means of 
ministerial decrees. The use of these extraordinary The Die* 
powers would be a breach of constitutional practice, tatorship, 
but not of law. King Carlos had already been I9 06-1908. 
criticized for alleged excessive interferences in politics. An 
experiment in government by decree had been made in May — 
October 1894; it was repeated in September 1905, when the 
king consented to prorogue the cortes until January 1906 in 
order to postpone discussion of the terms upon which the 
tobacco monopoly was to be allocated. A general election, 
in February 1906, was followed by three changes of ministry, 
the last of which, on the 19th of May, inaugurated the regime 
known in Portugal as the dictodura or dictatorship. Joao 
Franco, the new prime minister, was conspicuous among 
Portuguese politicians for his integrity, energy and courage; he 
intended to reform the national finances and administration — 
by constitutional means, if possible. The cortes, opened on the 
6th of June 1906, was dissolved on the 14th; another election 
took place, preceded by an official announcement that on this 
occasion all votes would be fairly counted; and \ht-Franquistas 
or " New Regenerators " obtained a majority. When the

cortes met, on the 29th of September, the opposition accused 
King Carlos of complicity in grave financial scandals. It was 
admitted that he had borrowed largely from the treasury, on 
the security of his civil list, and the Republican deputies 
accused him of endeavouring to assign the tobacco monopoly 
to one of his own foreign creditors, in settlement of the debt. 
Franco organized a coalition in defence of the Crown, but in 
January 1907 business in the cortes was brought to a standstill 
and many sittings ended in uproar. The attacks on the king 
were repeated at the trial of the poet Guerra Junqueiro, who was 
indicted for Ibse-majesU. All parties believed that the ministry 
would fall, and the rolatlvos prepared once more to divide the 
spoils of office, when, on the 2nd of May 1907, Joao Franco 
reconstructed his cabinet, secured tbe dissolution of the cortes 
and announced that certain bills still under discussion would 
receive the force of law. His partisans in the press hailed 
the advent of a second Pombal, and their enthusiasm was 
shared by many enlightened Portuguese, who had previously 
held aloof from politics but now rallied to the support of an 
honest dictator. JJacked by these forces, as well as by the king 
and the army, Franco effected some useful reforms. But his 
opponents included not only the Republicans, the professional 
politicians and those officials who feared inquiry, but also the 
magistracy, the district and municipal councils, and the large 
body of citizens who still believed in parliamentary government. 
The existing debt owed by D. Carlos to the nation was assessed 
a t £1 54)OOo. This sum was ostensibly paid by the transference 
to the treasury of the royal yacht " Amelia " and certain palaces; 
but the cost and upkeep of the " Amelia " had been paid with 
public money, while the palaces had long been maintained as state 
property. These transactions, though perhaps necessary to 
save the credit of the sovereign at the least possible cost, 
infuriated the opposition. Newspapers and politicians openly 
advocated rebellion; Franco had recourse to coercion. Sedi- 
tious journals were suppressed ; gaols and fortresses were crowded 
with prisoners; the upper house, which was hostile to tbe 
dictator, was deprived of its judicial powers and reconstituted 
on a less democratic basis (as in 1826); the district and muni- 
cipal councils were dissolved and replaced by administrative 
commissions nominated by the Crown (Jan. 1, 1908). 

The ministerial press from time to time announced the dis- 
covery of sensational plots against the king and the dictator. 
A ina- ^ * s> nowever » uncertain whether the assassination 
tionofKiagoi King Carlos and the crown prince (see Carlos I.), 
Carlos. on the 1st of February 1908, was part of a widely 
Aecesston organized conspiracy; or whether it was the act of 
an isolated band of fanatics, unconnected with any 
political party. The republican press applauded the murder; 
the professional politicians benefited by it. But the regicide 
Buica and his associates probably acted on their own initiative. 
The immediate results were the accession of Prince Manoel or 
Manuel (Emanuel II.) to the throne and the resignation of 
Franco, who sailed for Genoa. A coalition ministry, representing 
all the monarchist parties, was formed under the presidency of 
Admiral Ferreira do Amaral. The administrative commissions 
appointed by Franco were dissolved; the civil list was reduced; 
the upper house was reconstituted. A general election took 
place; in April the cortes met and the balance of power between 
Progressives and Regenerators was restored. On the 6th of 
May 1908 D. Manoel swore to uphold the constitution and was 
acclaimed king by the cortes. His uncle D. Affonso (b. 1865) 
took a similar oath as crown prince on the 22nd of March 1910. 

The failure of the dictatorship and the inability of the 
monarchists to agree upon any common policy had discredited 
The Revo- the existing regime, and at the general election of 
luthaof August 1910 the Republican candidates in Lisbon 
I9Wm and Oporto were returned by large majorities. On 

the 3rd of October the murder of a distinguished Republican 
physician, Dr Miguel Bombarda, precipitated the revolution 
which had been organized to take place in Lisbon ten days 
later. The Republican soldiers in Lisbon, aided by armed 
civilians and by the warships in the Tagus, attacked the loyal 



garrison and municipal guards, shelled the Neccssidades Palace, 
and after severe street-fighting (Oct. 4th-6tb) became masters 
of the capital. The king escaped to Ericeira, and thence, with 
the other members of the royal family, to Gibraltar. Soon 
afterwards they travelled undisturbed to England, where 
the king was received by the duke of Orleans. Through- 
out Portugal the proclamation of a republic was either 
welcomed or accepted without further resistance. A provi- 
sional government was formed under the presidency of Dr 
Theophilo Braga (b. 1843), a native of the Azores, who had 
since 1865 been prominent among Portuguese men of letters 
(see Literature, below). The new government undertook to 
carry out part of the Republican programme before summon- 
ing a constituent assembly to remodel the constitution. Among 
its most important acts were the expulsion of the religious con- 
gregations which had returned after 1834, the nationalization 
of their property, and the abolition, by decree, of the council 
of state, the upper house and all hereditary titles or privileges. 
The Republican programme also included the separation of 
Church and State, and the concession of local autonomy (on 
federal lines, if possible) to the provinces and colonies of Portugal.

Literature 
The Portuguese language can be most conveniently described 
in relation to the other languages of the Peninsula (see Spain; 
Language). Portuguese literature is distinguished by the 
wealth and variety of its lyric poetry, by its primacy in bucolic 
verse and prose, by the number of its epics and historical books, 
by the relative slightness of the epistolary element, and by the 
almost complete absence of the memoir. Rich as its romanceiro 
is, its volume is far less than the Spanish, but the cancioneiros

[LITERATURE 



remain to prove that the early love songs of the whole Peninsula 
were written in Portuguese, while the primitive prose redaction 
of Amadis, the prototype of all romances of chivalry, was 
almost certainly made in Portugal, and a native of the same 
country produced in the Diana of Montem6r (Montemayor) 
the masterpiece of the pastoral novel. The Lusiads may be 
called at once the most successful epic cast in the classical 
mould, and the most national of poems, and the great historical 
monuments and books of travel of the 16th and 17th centuries 
are worthy of a nation of explorers who carried the banner of 
the Quinas to the ends of the earth. On the other hand Portugal 
gave birth to no considerable dramatist from the time of Gil 
Vicente, in.the 16th century, until that of Garrett in the 19th, 
and it has failed to develop a national drama. 

Its geographical position and history have rendered Portugal 
very dependent for intellectual stimulus and literary culture 
on foreign countries, and writers on Portuguese literature are 
wont to divide their subjects into periods corresponding to the 
literary currents from abroad which have modified its evolution. 
To summarize, the first literary activity of Portugal was derived 
from Provence, and Provencal taste ruled for more than a 
century; the poets of the 15th century imitated the Castilians, 
and the 16th saw the triumph of Italian or classical influence. 
Spain again imposed its literary standards and models in 
the 17th century, France in the 18th, while the Romantic 
movement reached Portugal by way of England and France; and 
those countries, and in less degree Germany, have done much 
to shape the literature of the 19th century. Yet as regards the 
Peninsula, the literatures of Portugal and Castile act and react 
on one another and if the latter gave much, she also received 
much, for nearly every Portuguese author of renown from 1450 
until the 18th century, except Antonio Ferreira, wrote in Spanish, 
and some, like Jorge de Montem6r and Manoel de Mello, pro- 
duced masterpieces in that language and are numbered as 
Spanish classics. Again, in no country was the victory of the 
Italian Renaissance and the classical revival so complete, so 
enduring. 

But notwithstanding all its dependence on classical and 
foreign authors,- Portuguese literature has a distinct individuality 
which appears in the romanceiro, in the songs named cantares 
de amigo of the cancioneiros, in the Chronicles of Fernao Lopes, 
in the Historia tragico-viaritima, in the plays of Gil Vicente, 
in the bucolic verse and prose of the early 16th century, in the 
Letters of Marianna Alcoforado and, above all, in The Lusiads, 

Early Period. — Though no literary documents belonging to 
the first century of Portuguese history have survived, there is 
_ . evidence that an indigenous popular poetry both 

sacred and profane existed, and while Provencal 
influences moulded the manifestations of poetical talent for 
nearly two hundred years, they did not originate them. The 
close relations that prevailed between the reigning houses of 
Portugal, Provence and Aragon, cemented by intermarriages, 
introduced a knowledge of the gay science, but it reached Portugal 
by many other ways — by the crusaders who came to help in 
fighting the Moors, by the foreign prelates who occupied Penin- 
sular sees, by the monastic and military orders who founded 
establishments in Portugal, by the visits of individual singers 
to court and baronial houses, but chiefly perhaps by the pilgrims 
who streamed from every country along the Frankish way to 
the far-famed shrine of Santiago de Compostela. Already by 
the end of the 12th century the lyric poetry of the troubadours 
had found cultivators in Portugal, and a few compositions which 
have come down to us bear a date slightly anterior to the year 
1200. One of the earliest singers was D. Gil Sanches, an ille- 
gitimate son of Sancho I., and we possess a cantor de amigo in 
Galician-Portuguese, the first literary vehicle of the whole 
Peninsula, which appears to be the work of Sancho himself, 
and addressed to his concubine, A. Ribeirinha. The pre- 
Alphonsine period to which these men belong runs from 1200 to 
1245 and produced little of moment, but in 1248 the accession 
of King Alphonso III., who had lived thirteen years in France, 
inaugurated a time of active and rich production which is 



illustrated in the Cancioneiro da Ajuda, the oldest collection of 
Peninsular verse. The apogee of palace poetry dates from 
1275 to 1280, when young King Diniz displayed his exceptional 
talents in a circle formed by the best troubadours of his father 
Alphonso III. and the veterans of his grandfather Alphonso II., 
whose song-book, Cantigas de 5. Maria, contains the choicest 
religious verse of the age. Diniz, who had been educated 
by Amyeric of Cahors, proved himself the most fecund poet- 
king of his day, though the pleiad of fidalgos forming his court, 
and the jograes who flocked there from all parts, were fewer 
in number, less productive, and lacked the originality, vigour 
and brilliance of the singers who versified round Alphonso III. 

The principal names of the Dionysian period (1 284-1325) 
which is illustrated in the Cancioneiro da Vaticana are the king 
himself and his bastards D. Alphonso Sanches and D. Pedro, 
count of Barcellos. Of the two last, the former sings of love well 
and sincerely, while the latter is represented by love songs replete 
with false sentiment and by some rather gross songs of maldizer, a 
form which, if it rarely contains much poetical feeling or literary 
value, throws considerable light on the society of the time. 

The verses of Diniz, essentially a love poet, are conventional 
in tone and form, but he can write pretty ballads and pastorals 
when he allows himself to be natural. The Portuguese trouba- 
dours belonged to all social classes, and even included a few 
priests, and though love was their favourite topic they used 
every kind of verse, and in satire they hold the palm. In other 
respects they are inferior to their Provencal masters. Speaking 
generally, the cancioneiros form monotonous reading owing 
to their poverty of ideas and conventionality of metrical forms 
and expression, but here and there men of talent who were poets 
by profession and better acquainted with Provencal literature 
endeavoured to lend their work variety by the use of difficult 
processes like the lexaprem and by introducing new forms like 
the pastor ela and the descort. It is curious to note that no heroic 
songs are met with in the cancioneiros; they are all with one 
exception purely lyrical in form and tone. The death of King 
Diniz proved a severe blow to troubadour verse, and the reign 
of his successor Alphonso IV. witnessed a profound decadence 
of court poetry, while there is not a single poem by a Portuguese 
author in the last half of the 14th century, and only the names 
of a few authors have survived, among them the Galicians 
Vasco Pires de Camoens, an ancestor of Luiz de Camoens, and the 
typical lover Macias. The romanceiro, comprising romances of 
adventures, war and chivalry, together with religious and sea 
songs, forms a rich collection of ballad poetry which continued in 
process of elaboration throughout the whole of the middle ages, 
but unfortunately the oldest specimens have perished and scarcely 
any of those existing bear a date anterior to the 15th century. 

Epic poetry in Portugal developed much later than lyric, 
but the signal victory of the united Christian hosts over the 
Moors at the battle of the Salado in 1340 gave occasion to an 
epic by Alphonso Giraldes of which some fragments remain. 

The first frankly literary prose documents appear in the 14th 
century, and consist of chronicles, lives of saints and genealogical 
treatises. The more important are the Chronica 
breve do archivo national, the Chronicas de S. Cruz 
de Coimbra, the Chronica da conquista do Algarve and the 
Livros dos Linhagens, aristocratic registers, portions of which, 
like the story of King Arthur, have considerable literary interest. 
All the above may be found in the Portugaliae monumenta 
historica, scriptores, while the Life of St Elizabeth of Portugal 
is included in the Monorchia lusttana; Romania has printed 
the following hagiographical texts belonging to the same century 
— the Vida de Eufrosina, the Vida de Maria Egypcia and the 
Vida de Sancto Amaro; the Vida de Santo Eloy has appeared 
in the Instituto and the Vida dos Santos Barlado e Josafate has 
been issued by the Lisbon Academy of Sciences. 

Romances of chivalry belonging to the various cycles must 
have penetrated into Portugal at an early date, and the Nobili- 
ario of the Conde D. Pedro contains the genealogy of Arthur 
and the adventures of Lear and Merlin. There exists a mid- 
i4th-century Historia do Santo Graal, and an unprinted Josep

de Vasconcellos also belongs to the period, and there are other

The i$th Century. — In the reign of John I. the court 
became an important literary centre, the king himself composed 
a Livro de Montana, so far unedited, and his sons are 
rightly described as Camoens as " inclyta gera$ao, 
altos Infantes" King Edward (Duarte) collected a precious library 
composed of the ancient classics, some translated by his order, 
as well as medieval poems and histories, and he wrote a moral 
treatise Leal comselheiro, and hints on horsemanship, or Livro 
da ensinanca de hem cavalgar toda sella. His brother D. Pedro 
also wrote a moral treatise Da virtuoso Bemfcitoria, and caused 
Vegetius's De re militari and Cicero's De officiis to be turned into 
Portuguese. This travelled prince brought back from Venice a 
MS. of Marco Polo, the gift of the Senate, and is still remembered 
by the people through the story Livro das viagens do Infante 
D. Pedro qual andott ds sete partidas do mundo, reprinted almost 
yearly, of which he is the hero. All the monarchs of the 15th 
century were highly educated men and patrons of letters; indeed, 
even that typical medieval knight Alphonso V. confesses, in his 
correspondence with Azurara, that the sword avails nothing 
without the pen. The age is noted for its chronicles, beginning 
with the anonymous life of the Portuguese Cid, the Holy Con- 
stable Nuno Alvares Pereira, told in charming infantile prose, 
the translated Chronica dafundicao do moesteyro de Sam Vicente, 
and the Vida de D. Tello. Fernao Lopes (q.v.), the father of 
Portuguese history and author of chronicles of King Pedro, 
King Ferdinand and King John I., has been called by Sou they 
the best chronicler of any age or nation. Gomes Eannes de 
Azurara completed Lopes's chronicle of King John by describing 
the capture of Ceuta, and wrote a chronicle of D. Pedro de 
Menezes, governor of the town down to 1437, and a chronicle of 
D. Duarte de Menezes," captain of Alcacer, but his capital work 
is the chronicle of the conquest of Guinea (see Azurara). 

Though not a great chronicler or an artist like Lopes, Ruy de 
Pina (q.v.) is free from the rhetorical defects of Azurara, and his 
chronicles of King Edward and King Alphonso V. are character- 
ized by unusual frankness, and meritorious both as history and 
literature. All these three writers combined the posts of keeper 
of the archives and royal chronicler, and were, in fact, the king's 
men, though Lopes at least seems rather the historian of a 
people than the oracle of a monarch. Garcia de Resende (q.v.) 
appropriated Pina's chronicle of King John II., and after adding 
a wealth of anecdote and gossip and casting the glamour of poetry 
over a somewhat dry record, he reissued it under his own name. 
The taste for romances of chivalry continued throughout the 
15th century, but of all that were produced the only one that has 
come down to us is the Estorea do Imperador Vespasiano, an 
introduction to the Graal Cycle, based on the apocryphal gospel of 
Nicodemus. 

The Constable D. Pedro of Portugal, son of the prince of that 
name already referred to, has left some verses marked by 
elevation of thought and deep feeling, the Satyra de 
felice e infelice vida, and the death of his sister 
inspired his Tragedia de la reina Isabel; but he is best remem- 
bered by his Coplas del contempto del mundo in the Cancioneiro 
Geral. Though he actually drafted the first in his native tongue, 
all these poems are in Castilian, and D. Pedro is one of the first 
representatives of those Spanish influences which set aside the 
Provencal manner and in its place adopted a taste for allegory 
and a reverence for classical antiquity, both imported from Italy. 
It was to the constable that the marquis de Santillana addressed 
his historic letter dealing with the origins of Peninsular verse. 
The court, poetry of the reigns of King Alphonso V. and King 
John II., so far as it survives, is contained in the lyrical collection 
known Us the Cancioneiro Geral, compiled by Garcia de Resende 
and printed in 1516. Nearly three hundred authors are there 
represented by pieces in Portuguese and Castilian, and they 



Verse. 



include D. Joao Manuel, D. Joao de Menezes, Joao Rodrigues de 
Sa e Menezes, Diogo Brandao, Duarte de Brito and Fernao da 
Silveira. The literary progenitors of the cancioneiro were the 
Spanish poets Juan de Mena, Jorge Manrique, Garci-Sanchez 
de Badajos and Rodriguez del Padron, and its main subjects 
are love, satire and epigram. The epic achievements of the 
Portuguese in that century, the discoveries and the wars in 
Africa, hardly find an echo, even in the verses of those who had 
taken part in them. Instead, an atmosphere of artificiality 
surrounds these productions, and the verses that reveal genuine 
poetical feeling are very few. They include a lament of Garcia 
de Resende on the death of Ignez de Castro which probably 
inspired the inimitable stanzas dedicated to the same subject 
in The Lusiads, the Fingimento de Amores by Diogo Brandao, the 
Coplas of D. Pedro already referred to, and a number of minor 
pieces. However, some names appeared in the Cancioneiro Gerale 
which were to be among the foremost in Portuguese literature, 
e.g. Bernardim Ribeiro, Christovam Falcao, Gil Vicente, and 
Sa de Miranda, who represent the transition between the Spanish 
school of the 15th and the Italian school of the 1 6th century, 
the members of which are called Os Quinltentistas. Ribeiro and 
Falcao, the introducers of the bucolic style, put new life into 
the old forms, and by their eclogues in redondilhas, breathing 
the deepest and most genuine feeling in verses of perfect harmony, 
they gave models which subsequent writers worked by but could 
never equal. 

The Drama. — The history of the modern drama begins with 
religious plays, followed at a later period by moralities, and 
thence, by an easy transition, by the farce. This transition from 
the presentment of traditional types to the modern play can be 
traced in the works of Gil Vicente, the father of the Portuguese 
theatre. His first efforts belonged to the religious drama, and 
some of the more notable had edification for their object, e.g. 
the Barca do Inferno, but even in this class he soon introduces 
the comic element by way of relief, and in course of time he 
arrives at pure comedy and develops the study of character. 
For a detailed description and criticism of his work, see Vicente. 

In the various towns where he stayed and produced his plays, 
writers for the stage sprang up, and these formed the Eschola 
Velha or school of Gil Vicente. To name the best 0//v/c«i*tf 
known, Evora, the city of culture, produced Affonso mod the 
Alvarez, author of religious pieces, Antonio Ribeiro, Echols 
nicknamed "the Chiado," an unfrocked friar with Velba * 
a strong satirical vein who wrote farces in the Bazochian style, 
and his brother Jeronimo Ribeiro. In Santarem appeared 
Antonio Prestes, a magistrate who drew from his judicial 
experience but evinced more knowledge of folk-lore than 
dramatic talent, while Camoens himself was so far influenced 
by Gil Vicente, whose plays he had perhaps seen performed in 
Lisbon, that in spite of his Coimbra training he never exchanged 
the old forms for those of the classical comedy. His Amphi- 
tryons is a free imitation of the Latin, yet thoroughly national in 
spirit and cast in the popular redondilha; the dialogue is spirited, 
.the situations comic. King Sekucus derives from Plutarch and 
has a prose prologue of real interest for the history of the stage, 
while Filodemo is a clever tragi-comedy in verse with prose 
dialogues interspersed. Another poet of the s&ie school is 
Balthazar Dias, the blind poet, whose simple religious autos 
are still performed in the villages, and are continually reprinted, 
the best liked being the Auto of St Alexis, and the Auto of St 
Catherine. He is purely medieval in subject and spirit, his 
lyrics are perfect in form and expression, his diction thoroughly 
popular. One of the last dramatists of the 16th century 
belonging to the old school was Simao Machado, who wrote the 
Comedy of Diu and the Enchantments of Alfea, two long plays 
almost entirely in Spanish, and full of digressions only made 
tolerable by the beauty of their lyrics. 

Except Camoens, all these men, though disciples of Gil Vicente, 
are decidedly inferior to him in dramatic invention, fecundity 
and power of expression, and. they were generally of humble 
social position. Moreover the favour of the court was with- 
drawn on the death of Gil Vicente, and this meant much, for 



i 5 8 



PORTUGAL 



[LITERATURE 



there existed no educated middle class to support a national 
theatre. At the same time the old dramatists had to face the 
opposition of the classical school, which appealed to the cultured, 
and the hostility of the Inquisition, which early declared war 
on the popular plays on account of their grossness, and after- 
wards through the index prohibited altogether even the religious 
autos, as it had condemned the Italian comedies. The way was 
thus clear for the Jesuits, who, with their Latin tragi-comedies or 
dramatized allegories written to commemorate saints or for 
scholastic festivals, succeeded for a time in supplanting both 
the popular pieces of the old school and the plays modelled on 
the masterpieces of Greece and Rome. The old dramatists 
came to write for the lower classes only, and though the school 
lingered on, its productions were performed solely by travelling 
companies at country fairs. Though we know that much has 
perished, the four Indexes of the 16th century give some idea of 
the rich repertory of the popular theatre, and of the efforts 
necessary to destroy it; moreover, the Spanish Index of i559> 
by forbidding autos of Gil Vicente and other Portuguese authors, 
is interesting evidence of the extent to which they were appreci- 
ated* in the neighbouring country. 

The Renaissance. — The movement commonly called the 
Renaissance reached Portugal both indirectly through Spain 
and directly from Italy, with which last country it maintained 
close literary relations throughout the 15th century. King 
Alphonso V. had been the pupil of Matthew of Pisa and sum- 
moned Justus Balduinus to his court to write the national 
history in Latin, while later King John II. corresponded with 
Politian, and early in his reign the first printing-press got to 
work. In the next century many famous humanists took up 
their abode in Portugal. Nicholas Cleynarts taught the Infant 
Henry, afterwards cardinal and king, and lectured on the classics 
at Braga and Evora, Vasaeus directed a school of Latin at Braga, 
and George Buchanan accompanied other foreign professors 
to Coimbra when King John III. reformed the university. Many 
distinguished Portuguese teachers returned from abroad to 
assist <the king at the same time, among them Ayres Barbosa 
from Salamanca, Andr6 de Gouveia of the Parisian college of St 
Barbe, whom Montaigne' dubbed " the greatest principal of 
France," Achilles Estaco and Diogo de Teive. 

At home Portugal produced Andre de Resende (q.v.), author 
of the Historia da antiguidade da cidade de Evora and De 
anttquitatibus Lusitaniae, and Francisco de Hollanda, painter, 
architect, and author of, inter alia, the Quatro dialogos da 
pintura antiga. Moreover, women took a share in the intel- 
lectual movement of the time, and the sisters Luisa and Angela 
Sigea, Joanna Vaz and Paula Vicente, daughter of Gil Vicente, 
constituted an informal female academy under the presidency 
of the Infanta D. Maria, daughter of King Manoel. Luisa Sigea 
was both an orientalist and a Latin poetess, while Publia 
Hortensia de Castro, after a course of humanities, philosophy and 
theology, defended theses at Evora in her eighteenth year. 

The Italian school was founded by Sa de Miranda (q.v.)> a 
man of noble character who, on his return in 1526 from a six 
The Italian vears ' stav m Italy, where he had foregathered with 
School or Os the leading writers of the day, initiated a reform of 
Quia hen- Portuguese literature which amounted to a revolu- 
tion. He introduced and practised the forms of the 
sonnet, canzon, ode, epistle in oitava ritna and in tercets, and the 
epigram, and raised the whole tone of poetry. At the same time 
he gave fresh life to the national redondilha metre (medida velha) 
by his Cartas or Satiras which with his Eclogues, some in Portu- 
guese, others in Castilian, are his most successful compositions. 
His chief disciple, Antonio Ferreira (q.v.), a convinced classicist, 
went further, and dropping the use of Castilian, wrote sonnets 
much superior in form and style, though they lack the rustic 
atmosphere of those of his master, while his odes and epistles 
are too obviously reminiscent of Horace. D. Manoel de Portugal, 
Pero de Andrade Caminha, Diogo Bernardes, Frei Agostinho da 
Cruz and Andre Falcao de Resende continued the erudite 
school, which, after considerable opposition, definitely triumphed 
in the person of Luiz de Camoens. The Lima of Bernardes 



contains some beautiful eclogues as well as cartas in the bucolic 
style, while the odes, sonnets, and eclogues of Frei Agostinho 
are full of mystic charm. Camoens (q.v.) is, as Schlegel remarked, 
an entire literature in himself, and some critics rate him even 
higher as a lyric than as an epic poet. He unites and fuses the 
best elements of the Italian and the popular muse, using the 
forms of the one to express the spirit and traditions of the other, 
and when he employs the medida velha, it becomes in his hands 
a vehicle for thought, whereas before it had usually served 
merely to express emotions. 

His Lusiads, cast in the Virgilian mould, celebrates the 
combination of faith and patriotism which led to the discoveries 
and conquests of the Portuguese, and though the- pk . Poet 
voyage of Vasco da Gama occasioned its composition 
and formed the skeleton round which it grew, its true subject 
is the petto illustre lusitano. Immediately on its appearance 
The Lusiads took rank as the national poem par excellence, and 
its success moved many writers to follow in the same path; of 
these the most successful was Jeronymo Corte Real (q.v.). 
All these poems, like the Elegiada of Luis Pereira Brandao 
on the disaster of Al Kasr, the Primeiro ctrco de Diu of the 
chronicler Francisco de Andrade, and even the Affonso Ajricano 
of Quevedo, for all its futile allegory, contain striking episodes 
and vigorous and well-coloured descriptive passages, but they 
cannot compare with The Lusiads in artistic value. 

The return of Si de Miranda from Italy operated to transform 
the drama as well as lyric poetry. He found the stage occupied 
mainly by religious plays in which there appeared rhe 
no trace of the Greek or Roman theatre, and, classical 
admiring what he had seen in Italy, he and his Comedyand 
followers protested against the name auto, restored Tra s ed y* 
that of comedy, and substituted prose for verse. They generally 
chose the plays of Terence as models, yet their life is conventional 
and their types are not Portuguese but Roman-Italian. The 
revived classical comedy was thus so bound down by respect 
for authority as to have little chance of development, while 
its language consisted of a latinized 'prose from which the 
emotions were almost absent. Though it secured the favour 
of the humanists and the nobility, and banished the old popular 
plays from both court and university soon after Gil Vicente's 
death, its victory was shorttived. Jorge Ferreira de Vascon- 
cellos, who produced in the Eufrosina the first prose play, 
really belongs to the Spanish school, ' yet, though he wrote 
under the influence of the Celestina, which had a great vogue in 
Portugal, and of Roman models, his types, language and general 
characteristics are deeply national. However, even if they had 
stage^ qualities, the very length of this and his other plays, 
the Ulisipo and the Aulegraphia, would prevent their perform- 
ance, but in fact they are novels in dialogue containing a trea- 
sury of popular lore and wise and witty sayings with a moral 
object. So decisive was the success of Jorge Ferreira's new 
invention, notwithstanding its anonymity, that it decided Si 
de Miranda to attempt the prose comedy. He modelled himself 
on the Roman theatre as reflected by the plays of Ariosto, and he 
avowedly wrote the Estrangeiros to combat the school of Gil 
Vicente, while in it, as in Os Vilhalpandos, the action takes 
place in Italy. Antonio Ferreira, the chief dramatist of the 
classical school, knew both Greek and Latin as well as Miranda, 
but far surpassed him in style. He attempted both comedy 
and tragedy, and his success in the latter branch is due to the 
fact that he was not content to seek inspiration from Seneca, 
as were most of the tragedians of the 16th century, but went 
straight to the fountain heads, Sophocles and Euripides. His 
Bristo is but a youthful essay, but his second piece, Cioso, is 
almost a comedy of character, though both are Itatian even in 
the names of the personages. Ferreira's real claim to distinc- 
tion, however, rests on Ignez de Castro (see Ferreira). 

The principal form taken by prose writing in the 16th century 
was historical, and a pleiad of distinguished writers arose to 
narrate the discoveries and conquests in Asia, Africa and the 
ocean. Many of them saw the achievements they relate and 
were inspired by patriotism to record them, so that their writings 



LITERATURE] 



PORTUGAL

lack that serene atmosphere of critical appreciation which is 
looked for if history is to take its place as a science. In the four 
16th- decades of his Asia, Joao de Barros, the Livy 

Century of his country, tells in simple vigorous language 

Prose: tne "deeds achieved by the Portuguese in the dis- 

Hlstory. covery and conquest of the seas and lands of the 

Orient." His first decade undoubtedly influenced Camoens, and 
together the two men fixed the Portuguese written tongue, the 
one by his prose, the other by his verse. The decades, which 
were continued by Diogo do Couto, a more critical writer and 
a clear and correct stylist, must be considered the noblest 
historical monument of the century (see Barros)* Couto 
is also responsible for some acute observations on the causes of 
Portuguese decadence in the East, entitled Soldado practice 

The word encyclopaedist fits Damiao de Goes, a diplomatist, 
traveller, humanist and bosom friend of Erasmus. One of the 
most critical spirits of the age, his chronicle of King Manoel, 
the Fortunate Monarch, which he introduced by one of Prince 
John, afterwards King John II., is worthy of the subject and 
the reign in which Portugal attained the apogee of its greatness. 
Goes (q.v.) wrote a number of other historical and descriptive 
works in Portuguese and Latin, some of which were printed 
during his residence in the Low Countries and contributed to 
his deserved fame. After twenty years of investigation at 
Goa, Fernao Lopes de Castanheda issued his Historia do de- 
scobrimento e conquista da India pelos Portuguezes (Lisbon, 1552- 
1554 and 1 561), a book that ranks besides those of Barros and 
Couto. Antonio Galvao, who, after governing the Moluccas 
with rare success and integrity, had been offered the native 
throne of Ternate, went home in 1540, and died a pauper in a 
hospital, his famous- treatise only appearing posthumously. 
The Tratado dos diversos . . . caminhos por ondc a pimenta e 
especiaria veyo da India . . . e assim de todos as descubrimentas 
. . . que sao feitos em a era de 1560 has been universally recog- 
nized as of unique historical value. Like the preceding writers, 
Gaspar Correia or Correa lived long years in India and embodied 
his intimate knowledge of its manners and customs in the 
picturesque prose of the Lendas da India, which embraces the 
events of the years 1497 to 1550. Among other historical 
works dealing with the East are the Commentaries dc AJfonso 
a" Albuquerque t an account of the life of the great captain and 
administrator, by his natural son, and the Tratado das cousas 
da China e de Ormuz, by Frei Gaspar da Cruz. 

Coming back to strictly Portuguese history, we have the 
uncritical Chronica de D.Joao III. by Francisco de Andrade, 
and the Chronica de D. Sebastiao by Frei Bernardo da Cruz, 
who was with the king at Al Kasr al Kebir, while Miguel Leitao 
de Andrade, who was taken prisoner in that battle, related his 
experiences and preserved many popular traditions and customs 
in his Miscellanea. Bishop Osorio (q.v.), a scholar of European 
reputation, wrote chiefly in Latin, and his capital work, a 
chronicle of King Manoel, is in that tongue.- 

The books of travel of this century are unusually important 
because their authors were often the first Europeans to visit 
or at least to study the countries they refer to. They include, 
to quote the more noteworthy, the Descobrimento dc Frolida, 
the Itinerario of Antonio Tenreiro, the Vcrdadeira informacao 
das terras do Preste Joao by Francisco Alvares #nd the Ethiopia 
oriental by Frei Joao dos Santos, both dealing with Abyssinia, 
the Itinerario da terra santa by Frei Pantaleao de Aveiro, and 
that much- translated classic, the Historia da vida do padre 
Francisco Xavier by Padre Joao de Lucena. Fernao Cardim 
in his Narrativa epistolar records a journey through Brazil, and 
Pedro Teixeira relates his experiences in Persia. But the work 
that holds the palm in its class is the Peregrinaqao which Fernao 
Mendes Pinto (q.v.), the famous adventurer, composed in his 
old age for his children's reading. While Mendes Pinto and his 
book are typically Portuguese of that age, the Historia tragico- 
mariiima, sometimes designated the prose epic of saudade, is 
equally characteristic of the race of seamen which produced it. 
This collection of twelve stories of notable wrecks which befell 
Portuguese ships between 1552 and 1604 contains that of the 



galleon " St John " on the Natal coast, an event which inspired 
Corte-ReaPs epic poem as well as some poignant stanzas in 
The Lusiads, and the tales form a model of simple spontaneous 
popular writing. 

The romance took many forms, and in two of them at least 
works appeared which exercised very considerable influence 
abroad. The Mcnina e moqa of Bernardim Ribeiro, 
a tender pastoral story inspired by saudade for his ^J**™*** 
lady-love, probably moved Montemdr or Montemayor 
(q.v.) to write his Diana, and may some fifty years later have 
suggested the Lnsitania transformada to Fernao Alvares do 
Oriente, who, however, like Ribeiro,- owes some debt to San- 
nazaro's Arcadia. To name the Palmeirim d'Inglaterra of 
Moraes (q.v.) is to mention a famous book from which, we are 
told, Burke quoted in the House of Commons, while Cervantes 
had long previously declared that it ought to be" guarded as 
carefully as the works of Homer. Like most successful ro- 
mances of chivalry, it had a numerous progeny, but its sequels, 
D. Duardos by Diogo Fernandes, and D. Clarisel de Brctanha 
by Goncalves Lobato, are quite inferior. The historian Barros 
tried his youthful pen in a romance of chivalry, the Chronica 
do Imperador Clarimundo, while in another branch, and a popular 
one in Portugal, the Arthurian cycle, the dramatist Ferreira 
dc Vasconcellos wrote Sagramor or Memorial das proesas da 
segunda Tavola Redonda. A book of quite a different order is 
the Contos de proveito e exemplo by Fernandes Trancoso, con- 
taining a series of twenty-nine tales derived from tradition 
or imitated from Boccaccio and others, which enjoyed deserved 
favour for more than a century. 

Samuel Usque, a Lisbon Jew, deserves a place to himself 
for his ConsolaQam ds tribulacoes de Israel, where he exposes 
the persecutions endured by his countrymen in every age down to 
his time; the book takes the dialogue form, and its diction is 
elegant and pure. The important part taken by Portuguese 
prelates and theologians at the Council of Trent stimulated 
religious writing, most of it in Latin, but Frei Bartholomeu dos 
Martyres, archbishop of Braga, wrote a Cathecismo da doutrina 
Christ a, Frei Luiz de Granada a Cotnpendio de Doutrina Christ a 
and Services, all in Portuguese, and other notable pulpit orators 
include Diogo de Paiva de Andrade, Padre Luiz Alvares, Dom 
Antonio Pinheiro and Frei Miguel dos Santos, who preached at 
the obsequies of King Sebastian. 

Among the moralists of the time three at least deserve the 
title of masters of prose style, Heitor Pinto for his Imogens da 
vida Christa, Bishop Arraez for his Dialogos, and Frei Thome de 
Jesus for his noble devotional treatise Trabalhos de Jesus, while 
the maxims of Joanna da Gama, entitled Ditos da Frcira, 
though lacking depth, form a curious psychological document. 
The ranks of scientists include the cosmographer Pedro Nunes 
(Nonius), a famous mathematician, and the botanist Garcia da 
Orta, whose Colloqnios dos simples e drogas was the first book to 
be printed in the East (1563), while the form of Aristotelian 
scholastic philosophy known as Philosophia conimbricensis 
had a succession of learned exponents. As, however, their 
vehicle was Latin, a mere mention must suffice, and for the 
same reason only the title of a notable book by Francisco Sanches 
can be given, the De nobili ci prima tmiversali scientia quod 
nihil scitur. 

In 1536 Fernao de Oliveira published the first Portuguese 
grammar, and three years later the historian Barros brought out 
his Cartinha para aprender a ler, and in 1540 his Grammatica. 
Magalhaes Gandavo printed some rules on orthography in 1574. 
Nunes de Leao also produced a treatise on orthography in 1576 
and a work on the origins of the. language in 1605, and Jeronymo 
Cardoso gave his countrymen a Latin and Portuguese dictionary. 

The 17th Century. — The gigantic efforts put forth in every 
department of activity during the 16th century led to the 
inevitable reaction. Energy was worn out, patriotic OsSelscea- 
ardour declined into blind nationalist vanity, and ^^5. 
rhetoric conquered style. From a literary as from ^ rfc 
a political point of view the 17th century found PoeU ^ m 
Portugal in a lamentable state of decadence which dated from

[LITERATURE 



the preceding age. In 1536 the Inquisition began its work, 
while between 1552 and 1555 the control of higher education 
passed into the hands of the Jesuits. Following the Inquisition 
and the Jesuits came two other obstacles to the cultivation of 
letters, the censorship of books and the Indexes, and, as if these 
plagues were not enough, the Spanish domination followed. 
Next the taint of Gongorism appeared, and the extent to which 
it affected the literature of Portugal may be seen in the five 
volumes of the Fenix renascida, where the very titles of the 
poems suffice to show the futilities which occupied the attention 
of some of the best talents. The prevailing European fashion 
of literary academies was not long in reaching Portugal, and 
1647 saw the foundation of the Academia dos Generosos which 
included in its ranks the men most illustrious by learning and 
social position, and in 1663 the Academia dos Singular es came 
into being 1 ; but with all their pedantry, extravagances and bad 
taste, it must be confessed that these and similar corporations 
tended to promote the pursuit of good literature. In bucolics 
there arose a worthy disciple of Ribeiro in Francisco Rodrigues 
Lobo (q.v.), author of the lengthy pastoral romances Corte na 
aldea and Pritnavera, the songs in which, with his eclogues, 
earned him the name of the Portuguese Theocritus. The fore- 
most literary figure of the time was the encyclopaedic Francisco 
Manoel de Mello (q.v.), who, though himself a Spanish classic, 
strove hard and successfully to free himself from subservience 
to Spanish forms and style. Most of the remaining lyricists of 
the period were steeped in Gongorism or, writing in Spanish, 
have no place here. It suffices to mention Soror Violente do Ceo, 
an exalted mystic called " the tenth muse," Bernarda Ferreira 
de Lacerda, author of the Soledades de Bussaco, the Laura do 
Anfrizo of Manoel Tagarro, the Sylvia de Lizardo of Frei Bernardo 
de Brito, and the poems of Frei Agostinho das Chagas, who, 
however, is better represented by his Cartas espirituaes. Satiri- 
cal verse had two notable cultivators in D. Thomas de Noronha 
and Antonio Serrao de Castro, the first a natural and facile writer, 
the second the author of Os Ratos da Inquisicao, a facetious 
poem composed during his incarceration in the dungeons of the 
Inquisition, while Diogo de Sousa Camacho showed abundant 
wit at the expense of the slaves of Gongorism and Marinism. 

The gallery of . epic poets is a large one, but most of 
their productions are little more than rhymed chronicles and 
have almost passed into oblivion. The Ulyssea of 
Pbet/y. Gabriel Pereira de Castro describes the foundation 
of Lisbon by Ulysses, but, notwithstanding its 
plagiarism of The Lusiads and faults of taste, these ten cantos 
contain some masterly descriptive passages, and the oitava 
rima shows a harmony and flexibility to which even Camoens 
rarely attained; but this praise cannot be extended to the 
tiresome Ulyssipo of Sousa de Macedo. The Malaca conquistada 
of Francisco de S£ de Menezes, having Alphonso d' Albuquerque 
for its hero, is prosaic in form, if correct in design. Rodriguez 
Lobo's twenty cantos in honour of the Holy Constable do him 
no credit, but the Viriato tragico by that travelled soldier 
Garcia de Mascarenhas has some vigorous descriptions, and 
critics reckon it the best epic of the second class. 

In point of style the historians of the period are laboured 

and rhetorical; they were mostly credulous friars who wrote in 

History. ^eir cells, and no longer, as in the 16th century, 

travellers and men of action who described what 

they had seen. 

Frei Bernardo de Brito began his ponderous Monarchia 
Lusitana with the creation of man and ended it where he should 
have begun, with the coming of Count Henry to the Peninsula. 
His contribution is a mass of legends destitute of foundation or 
critical sense, but both here and in the Chronica de Cister he 
writes a good prose. Of the four continuers of Brito's work, 
three are no better than their master, but Frei Antonio Brandao, 
who dealt with the period from King Alphonso Henriques to 
King John II., proved himself a man of high intelligence and a 
learned, conscientious historian. 

Frei Luiz de Sousa, a typical monastic chronicler, although he 
had begun life as a soldier, worked up the materials collected by 



others, and after much labor limae produced the panegyrical 
Vida de D. Frei Bartholemeu dos martyres, the Historia de S. 
Domingos, and the Annaes oVel rei D. Joao III. His style is 
lucid and vivid, but he lacks the critical sense, and the speeches 
he puts into the mouths of his characters are imaginary. Manoel 
de Faria y Sousa (q.v.), a voluminous writer on Portuguese 
history and the arch-commentator of Camoens, wrote, by an 
irony of fate, in Spanish, and Mello's classic account of the 
Catalonian War is also in that language, while, by a still greater 
irony, Jacinto Freire de Andrade thought to picture and exalt 
the Cato-like viceroy of India by his grandiloquent Vida de D. 
Joao de Castro. 

Other historical books of the period are the valuable Discursos 
of Severim de Faria, the Portugal restaur ado of D. Luis de 
Menezes, conde de Ericeira, the ecclesiastical histories of Arch- 
bishop Rodrigo da Cunha, the Agiologio lusitano of Jorge Cardoso 
and the Chronica da Companhia de Jesus by Padre Balthazar 
Telles. The las\ also wrote an Historia da Ethiopia, and, though 
the travel literature of this century compares badly with that of 
the preceding, mention may be made of the Itinerario da India 
por terra ate a ilha de Chipre of Frei Gaspar de S. Bernardino, 
and the Relaqao do novo caminho atravts da Arabia e Syria of 
Padre Manoel Godinho. 

In the 17th century the religious orders and especially the 
Jesuits absorbed even more of the activities and counted for 
more in the public affairs of Portugal than in the oratory. 
preceding age. The pulpit discharged some of the 
functions of the modern press, and men who combined the gifts 
of oratory and writing filled it and distinguished themselves, 
their order and their country. The Jesuit Antonio Vieira (q.v.) , 
missionary, diplomat and voluminous writer, repeated the 
triumphs he had gained in Bahia and Lisbon in Rome, which 
proclaimed him the prince of Catholic orators. His 200 sermons 
are a mine of learning and experience, and they stand out from 
all others by their imaginative power, originality of view, 
variety of treatment and audacity of expression. His letters 
are in a simple conversational style, but they lack the popular 
locutions, humour and individuality of those of Mello. Vieira 
was a man of action, while the oratorian Manoel Bernardes lived 
as a recluse, hence his sermons and devotional works, especially 
Luz e Calor and the Nova Floresta, breathe a calm and sweetness 
alien to the other, while they are even richer treasures of pure 
Portuguese. Perhaps the truest and most feeling human 
documents of the century are the five epistles written by 
Marianna Alcoforado (q.v.) known to history as the Letters of a 
Portuguese Nun. Padre Ferreira de Almeida's translation of the 
Bible has considerable linguistic importance, and philological 
studies had an able exponent in Amaro de Roboredo. 

The popular theatre lived on in the Comedies de Cordel, 
mostly anonymous and never printed its existence would 
hardly be known were it not for the pieces which The Drama. 
were placed on the Index. The popular autos that 
have survived are mainly religious, and show the abuse of 
metaphor and the conceits which derive from Gongora. All 
through this century Portuguese dramatists, who aspired to be 
heard, wrote, like Jacintho Cordeiro and Mattos Fragoso, in 
Castilian, though a brilliant exception appeared in the person of 
Francisco Manoel de Mello (q.v.), whose witty Auto do fidalgo 
aprendiz in redondilhas is eminently national in language, 
subject and treatment. Until the Restoration of 1640 the stage 
remained spellbound by the Spaniards, and when a court once 
more came to Lisbon it preferred Italian opera, French plays, 
and zarzuelas to dramatic performances in the vernacular, with 
the result that both Portuguese authors and actors of repute 
disappeared. 

• The 1 8th Century.— The first part of the 18th century 
differs little from the preceding age except that both affectation 
and bad taste tended to increase, but gradually signs appeared 
of a literary revolution, which preceded the political and 
developed into the Romantic movement. Men of liberal ideas 
went abroad, chiefly to France, to escape the stupid tyranny that 
ruled in Church and state, and to their exhortation and example

PORTUGAL

are largely due the reforms which were by degrees inaugurated 
in every branch of letters. Their names were among others 
Alexandre de Gusmao, the Cavalhciro de Oliveira, Ribeiro 
Sanches, Correa da Serra, Brotero and Nascimento. They had 
a forerunner in Luiz Antonio Verney, who poured sarcasm on 
the prevailing methods of education, and exposed to good effect 
the extraordinary literary and scientific decadence of Portugal 
in an epoch-making work, the Verdadeiro mcthodo de estudor. 

From time to time literary societies, variously called academies 
or arcadias, arose to co-operate in the work of reform. In 
1720 King John V., an imitator of Louis XIV., 
Mto£* of established the academy of history. The* fifteen 
volumes of its Memorias, published from 172 1 to 
1756, show the excellent work done by its members, among 
whom were Caetano de Sousa, author of the colossal Historia 
da Casa Real porlugueza, Barbosa Machado, compiler of the 
invaluable Bibliotkeca Lusitana, and Soares da Silva, chronicler 
of the reign of King John I. 

The Royal Academy of Sciences founded in 1 780 by the 2nd 
duke of Lafoes, uncle of Queen Maria I., still exists, though its 
Royal output and influence are small. Its chief contribu- 

Academy of tions to knowledge were the Diccionario da lingua 
Sciences. porlugueza, still unfinished, and the Memorias (1788- 
WS)* and it included in its ranks nearly all the learned men of 
the last part of the 18th century. Among them were the ecclesi- 
astical historian Frei Manoel do Cenaculo, bishop of Beja, the 
polygraph Ribeiro dos Santos, Caetano do Amaral, a patient 
investigator of the origins of Portugal, Joao Pedro Riberio, 
the founder of modern historical studies, D. Francisco Alexandre 
Lobo, bishop of Vizeu, whose essays on Camoens and other 
authors show sound critical sense and a correct style, Cardinal 
Saraiva, an expert on ancient and modern history and the 
voyages of his countrymen, and Frei Fortunato de S. Boa Ven- 
tura, a historical and literary critic. 

In 1756 Cruz e Silva (q.v.) t with the aid of friends, established 
the Arcadia Ulysiponense, " to form a school of good sayings 
and good examples in eloquence and poetry." The most 
Arcadias, considered poets of the day joined the Arcadia and 
Lyric individually wrote much excellent verse, but they 

Poetry, Ac a u lacked creative power. The principal Greek and 
Latin authors were the models they chose, and Garcao, the most 
prominent Arcadian, composed the Cantata de Dido, a gem of 
ancient art, as well as some charming sonnets to friends and 
elegant odes and epistles. The bucolic verse of Quita, a hair- 
dresser, has a tenderness and simplicity which challenge com- 
parison with Bernardim Ribeiro, and the Marilia of Gonzaga 
contains a celebrated collection of bucolic-erotic verse. Their 
conventionality sets the lyrics of Cruz e Silva on a lower plane, 
but in the Hyssope he improves on the Lutrin of Boileau. After 
a chequered existence, internal dissensions caused the dissolution 
of the Arcadia in 1774. It had only gained a partial success 
because the despotic rule of Pombal, like the Inquisition before 
him, hindered freedom of fancy and discussion, and drove the 
Arcadians to waste themselves on flattering the powerful. 
In 1790 a New Arcadia came into being. Its two most distin- 
guished members were the rival poets Bocage (q.v.) and Agostinho 
de Macedo (q.v.). The only other poet of the New Arcadia 
who ranks high is Curvo Semedo; but the Dissidents, a name 
bestowed on those who stood outside the Arcadias, included 
two distinguished men now to be cited, the second of whom 
became the herald of a poetical revolution. No Portuguese 
satirist possessed such a complete equipment for his office as 
Nicolao Tolentino, and though a dependent position depressed 
his muse, he painted the customs and follies of the time with 
almost photographic accuracy, and distributed his attacks or 
begged for favours in sparkling verse. The task of purifying 
and enriching the language and restoring the cult of the Quin- 
hentistas was perseveringly carried out by Francisco Manoel de 
Nascimento (q.v.) in numerous compositions in prose and verse, 
both original and translated. Shortly before his death in Paris 
he became a convert to the Romantic movement, and he 
prepared the wav for its definite triumph in the person of 
xxii. 6 



Almeida Garrett, who belonged to the Filinlistas, or followers 
of Nascimento, in opposition to the Elmanislas, or disciples of 
Bocage. 

Early in the 18th century the spirit of revolt against despotism 
led to an attempt at the restoration of the drama by authors 
sprung from the people, who wrote for spectators 
as coarse as they were ignorant of letters. Its e r * mm * 
centres were the theatres of the Bairro Alto and Mouraria, and 
the numerous pieces staged there belong to low comedy. The 
Operas porluguezas of Antonio Jos6 da Silva {q.v.) t produced 
between 1733 and 17-41, owe their name to the fact that arias, 
minuets and modinhas were interspersed with the prose dialogue, 
and if neither the plots, style, nor language are remarkable, 
they have a real comic force and a certain originality. Silva 
is the legitimate representative in the 18th century of the popular 
theatre inaugurated by Gil Vicente, and though born in Brazil, 
whence he brought the tnodinka, he is essentially a national writer. 
Like Silva's operas, the comedies of Nicolao Luiz contain a 
faithful picture of contemporary society and enjoyed consider- 
able popularity. Luiz divided his attention between heroic 
comedies and comedies de capa y espada, but of the fifty-one 
ascribed to him, all in verse, only one bears his name, the rest 
appeared anonymously. His method was to choose some Spanish 
or Italian play, cut out the parts he disliked, and substitute 
scenes with dialogues in his own way, but he has neither ideals, 
taste nor education; and, except in Os Maridos Per alias, his 
characters are lifeless and their conventional passions .are 
expressed in inflated language. Notwithstanding their de- 
merits, however, his comedies held the stage from 1760 until 
the end of the century. 

Meanwhile the Arcadia also took up the task of raising the 
tone of the stage, but though the ancients and the classic writers 
of the 16th century were its ideals, it drew immediate inspiration 
from the contemporary French theatre. All its efforts failed, 
however, because its members lacked dramatic talents and, 
being out of touch with the people, could not create a national 
drama. 

Garcao (q.v.) led the way with the Theatro Novo, a bright 
little comedy in blank verse, and followed it up with another, 
Assemblia on partida\ but he did not persevere. Figueiredo 
felt he had a mission to restore the drama, and wrote thirteen 
volumes of plays in prose and verse, but, though he chose national 
subjects, and could invent plots and draw characters, he could 
not make them live. Finally, the bucolic poet Quita produced 
the tragedies Segunda Castro, Hermionc and two others, but 
these imitations from the French, for all the taste they show, 
were stillborn, and in the absence of court patronage, which 
was exclusively bestowed on the Lisbon opera, then the best 
equipped in Europe, Portugal remained without a drama of its 
own. 

Sacred eloquence is represented by Fr. Alexandre Palhares, 
a student of Vieira, whose outspoken attack on vice in high 
places in a sermon preached before Queen Maria led to his exile 
from court. The art of letter-writing had cultivators in Abbade 
Costa, Ribeiro Sanches, physician of Catherine II. of Russia, 
Alexandre de Gusmao, and the celebrated Cavalheiro de Oli- 
veira, also author of Memorias poliiicas e liter arias, published at 
the Hague, whither he had fled to escape the Inquisition. 
Philological studies were pursued with ardour and many valuable 
publications have to be recorded, among them Bluteau's Voca- 
bulario Portuguez, the Reflexdes sobre a lingoa portugueza and 
an Arte poetica by Francisco Jos6 Freire, the Exercicios and 
Espirito da lingoa e eloquencia of Pereira de Figueiredo, trans- 
lator of the Vulgate, and Viterbo's Elucidario, a dictionary of 
old terms and phrases which has not been superseded. Finally 
the best literary critic and one of the most correct prose writers 
of the period is Francisco Dias Gomes. 

The igth Century and After. — The 19th century witnessed a 
general revival of letters, beginning with the Romantic move- 
ment, of which the chief exponents were Garrett (q.v.) and 
Herculano (q.v.), both of whom had to leave Portugal on account 
of their political liberalism, and it was inaugurated in the

field of poetry. Garrett read the masterpieces of contemporary 
foreign literature during his exiles in England and France, and, 
The imbued with the national spirit, he produced in 1825 

Romantic the poem Camoes, wherein he broke with the estab- 
Movement: Hshed rules of composition in verse and destroyed 
Poe *° r * the authority of the Arcadian rhymers. His poetry 
like that of his fellow emigre', the austere Herculano, is eminently 
sincere and natural, but while his short lyrics are personal in 
subject and his longer poems historical, the verse of Herculano 
is generally subjective and the motives religious or patriotic. 
The movement not only lost much of its virility and genuineness, 
but became ultra-Romantic with A. F. de Castilho (q.v.) y whose 
most conspicuous followers were Joao de Lemos and the poets 
of the collection entitled O Trovador; Soares de Passos, a 
singer for the sad; the melodious Thomas Ribeiro, who drew 
his inspiration from Zorilla and voiced the opposition to a 
political union with Spain in the patriotic poem D. Jayme. 
Mendes Leal, a king in the heroic style, Gomes de Amorim 
and Bulhao Pato, belong more or less to the same school. 
On the other hand Jos6 Simoes Dias broke with the Romantic 
tradition in which he had been educated, and successfully 
sought inspiration from popular sources, as his Peninsulares 
proves. 

In 1865 there .arose a serious and lengthy strife in the Por- 
tuguese Parnassus, which came to be known as the Coimbra 
The question, from its origin in the university city. 

Coimbra Its immediate cause was the preface which Castilho 
Question, contributed to the poem Mocidade of Pinheiro 
Chagas, and it proclaimed the alliance of poetry with philosophy. 
The younger men of letters regarded Castilho as the self-elected 
pontiff of a mutual-praise school, who, ignorant of the literary 
movement abroad, claimed to direct them in the old paths, and 
would not tolerate, criticism. The revolt against his primacy 
took the form of a fierce war of pamphlets, and led ultimately 
to the dethronement of the blind bard. The leaders in the 
movement were Ant hero de Quental (q.v.) and Dr Theophilo 
Braga, the first a student of German philosophy and poetry, 
the second a disciple of Comte and author of an epic of humanity, 
Visao dos tempos, whose immense work in the spheres of poetry, 
criticism and literary history, marred by contradictions, but 
abounding in life, cannot be judged at present. In the issue 
literature gained considerably, and especially poetry, which 
entered on a period of active and rich production, still un- 
checked, in the persons of Joao de Deus (q.v.) and the Coim- 
brans and their disciples. The Campo de flares contains some 
of the most splendid short poems ever written in Portuguese, 
and an Italian critic has ventured to call Joao de Deus, to whom 
God and women were twin sources of inspiration, the greatest 
love poet of the 19th century. Simplicity, spontaneity and 
harmony distinguished his earlier verses, which are also his 
best, and their author belongs to no school but stands alone. 
A preponderance of reflection and foreign influences distinguish 
the poets now to be mentioned. Anthero de Quental, the chief 
of the Coimbrans, enshrined ' his metaphysical neo-Buddhistic 
ideas overshadowed by extreme pessimism, and marked the 
stages of his mental evolution, in a sequence of finely-wrought 
sonnets. These place him in the sacred circle near to Heine 
and Leopardi, and, though strongly individualistic, it is curious 
to note in them the influence of Germanism on the mind of a 
southerner and a descendant of the Catholic navigators of the 
16th century. Odes modernas, written in youth, show " Santo 
Anthero," as his friends called him, in revolutionary, free- 
thinking and combative mood, and are ordinary enough, but 
the prose of his essays, e.g. Considerations on the Philosophy 
of Portuguese Literary History *, has that peculiar refinement, 
clearness and conciseness which stamped the later work of 
this sensitive thinker. A subtle irony pervades the Rimas of 
Joao Penha, who links the Coimbrans with Guerra Junqueiro and 
the younger poets. Partly philosophical, partly 
naturalistic, Junqueiro began with the ironical com- 
position, A Morte de D. Joao; in Patria he evoked 
in a scries of dramatic scenes and lashed with satire the kings of 



Recent 
Verse. 



the Braganza dynasty, and in Os Simples he interprets in 
sonorous stanzas the life of country-folk by the light of his 
powerful imagination and pantheistic tendencies. The Clari- 
dades de Sul of Gomes Leal, a militant anti-Christian, at times 
recall Baudelaire, and flashes of genius run through Anti- 
ChristOy which is alive with the instinct of revolt. The S6 
of the invalidish Antonio Nob re is intensely Portuguese in 
subjects, atmosphere and rhythmic sweetness, and had a deep 
influence. Cesario Verde* sought to interpret universal nature 
and human sorrow, and the Parnassian Goncalves Crespo may 
be termed a deeper, richer Coppee. His Miniaturas and Noc- 
turnos have been re-edited by his widow, D. Maria Amalia Vaz de 
Carvalho, a highly gifted critic and essayist whose personality 
and cercle call to mind the 18th-century poetess, the Marqueza 
de Alorna. The French symbolists found an enthusiastic 
adept in Eugenio de Castro. Antonio Feijo and Jose de Sousa 
Monteiro have written verse remarkable by its form, while 
perhaps the most considered of the later poets are Antonio 
Correa de Oliveira and Lopes Vieira. Many other genuine 
bards might be mentioned, because the Portuguese race can 
boast of an unceasing flow of lyric poetry. 

Garrett took in hand the reform of the stage, moved by a 
desire to exile the translations on which the playhouses had long 
subsisted. He chose his subjects from the national 
history, and began with the Auto de Gil Vicente , in 
which he resuscitated the founder of the theatre, and followed 
this up with other prose plays, among which the Alfageme 
de Santarem takes the palm; finally he crowned his labours 
by Frei Luiz de Sousa, a tragedy of fatality and pathos and one 
of the really notable pieces of the century. The historical bent 
thus given to the drama was continued by the versatile Mendes 
Leal, by Gomes da Amorim and by Pinheiro Chagas, who all 
however succumbed more or less to the atmosphere and machi- 
nery of ultra-Romanticism, while the plays of Antonio Ennes 
deal with questions of the day in a spirit of combative liberalism. 
In the social drama, Ernesto Biester, and in comedy Fernando 
Caldeira, also no mean lyric poet, are two of the principal names, 
and the latter's pieces, A Mantilha da Renda and A Madrugada, 
have a delicacy and vivacity which justifies their success. The 
comedies of Gervasio Lobato are marked by an easy dialogue 
and a sparkling wit, and some of the most popular of them were 
written in collaboration with D. Joao de Camara, the leading 
dramatist of the day, one of whose pieces, Os Velhos, has been 
translated and staged abroad. To Henrique Lopes de Men- 
donga, scholar, critic and poet, we owe some strong historical 
plays as well as the piece Z6 Palonso, written with Lobato, 
which made a big hit. The playwrights also include Julio 
Dantas, and Dr Marcellino Mesquita, author of Leonor Telles 
and other historical dramas, as well as of a powerful piece, 
Ddr suprema. 

Herculano led the way in the historical romance by his Lendas 
e narrativas and Monasticvn, two somewhat laboured pro- 
ductions, whose progenitor was Walter Scott; they TheNovet 
still find readers for their impeccable style. Their 
most popular successors have been A Moqidade de D. Joao V. 
and A ultima corrida de touros reaes em Salvaterra by Rebello 
da Silva, and Um Anno na Corte by the statesman, Andrade 
Corvo, the first and the last superior books. The novel shares 
with poetry the predominant place in the modern literature of 
Portugal, and Camillo Castello Branco (q.v.), Gomes Coelho and 
Eca de Queiroz are names which would stand very high in any 
country. The first, a wonderful impressionist though not per- 
haps a great novelist, describes to perfection the domestic and 
social life of Portugal in the early part of the 19th century. 
His remarkable works include Amor de Perdiqao, Amor de Sol- 
va0Oj Retrato de Ricardina, and the series entitled Novellas do 
Minho\ moreover some of his essays in history and literary 
criticism, such as Bohemia do Espirito, rank only next to his 
romances. Gomes Coelho, better known as Julio Diniz, records 
his experiences of English society in Oporto in A Familia 
ingleza, and for his romantic idealism he has been dubbed 
British; Portuguese critics have accused him of imitating Dickens.

His stories, particularly As Pupillas do Snr. Reitor, depict 
country life and scenery with loving sympathy, and hold the 
reader by the charm of the characters, but Diniz is a rather 
subjective monotonous writer who lacks the power to analyse, 
and he is no psychologist. Eca de Queiroz (q.v.) founded the 
Naturalist school in Portugal by a powerful book written in 
187 1, but only published in 1875, under the title The Crime of 
Father Amaro; and two of his great romances, Cousin Basil 
and Os Maias, were written during his occupancy of consular 
posts in England. The Relic conveys the impressions of a 
journey in Palestine and in parts suggests his indebtedness to 
Flaubert, but its mysticism is entirely new and individual; 
while the versatility of his talent further appears in The Cor- 
respondence of Fradique Mendes, where acute observation is 
combined with brilliant satire or rich humour. The later por- 
tion of The City and the Mountains, for the truth and beauty of 
its descriptive passages, is highly praised, and many pages are 
already quoted as classic examples of Portuguese prose. Among 
other novelists are Oliveira Marreca, Pinheiro Chagas, Arnaldo 
Gama, Luis dc Magalhacs and Teixeira de Queiroz, the last of 
whom is almost as distinctly national a writer as Castello Branco 
himself. 

Years of persevering toil in archives and editions of old 
chronicles prepared Herculano for his magnum opus, the Historia 
de Portugal. The Historia da Origem e. Estabele- 
cimento da Inquisicao em Portugal followed and 
confirmed the position of its author as the leading modern 
historian of the Peninsula, and he further initiated and edited 
the important series Portugaliae Monttntenta hislorica. The 
Visconde de Santarem, and Judice Biker in geography and 
diplomatics, produced standard works; Luz Soriano com- 
piled painstaking histories of the reign of King Joseph and 
of the Peninsular War; Silvestre Ribeiro printed a learned 
account of the scientific, literary and artistic establishments of 
Portugal, and Lieut.-Colonel Christovam Ayres was the author 
of a history of the Portuguese army. Rebello da Silva and the 
voluminous and brilliant publicists, Latino Coelho and Pin- 
heiro Chagas, wrote at second hand and rank higher as stylists 
than as historians. Gama Barros and Costa Lobo followed 
closely in the footsteps of Herculano, the first by a Historia 
da Administraqao publica em Portugal nos Seculos XII. a AT., 
positively packed with learning, the second by a Historia da 
Sociedade cm Portugal no Seculo XV. Though he had no time 
for original research, Oliveira Martins (q.v.) possessed psycho- 
logical imagination, a rare capacity for general ideas and the 
gift of picturesque narration; and in his philosophic Historia 
de Portugal, his sensational Portugal contemporaneo, Os Filhos 
de D. Joao and Vida de Ntm' Alvarez, he painted an admirable 
series of portraits and, following his master Michelet, made the 
past live again. Furthermore the interesting volumes of his 
Bibliotheca das Sciencias Sociaes show extensive knowledge, 
freshness of views and critical independence and they have 
greatly contributed to the education of his countrymen. 

Ramalho Ortigao, the art critic, will be remembered prin- 
cipally for the Farpas, a series of satirical and humorous sketches 
of Portuguese society which he wrote in collabora- 
m * tion with Queiroz. Julio Cesar Machado and Fialho 
de Almeida made their mark by many humorous publications, 
and, in the domain of pure literary criticism, mention must be 
made of Antonio Pedro Lopes de Mendonca, Rebello da Silva, 
Dr Joaquim de Vasconcellos, Mme Michaelis de Vascon- 
cellos, Silva Pinto, the favourite disciple of Castello Branco, 
and of Luciano Cordeiro, founder of the Lisbon Geographical 
Society, whose able monograph, Soror Marianna, vindicated 
the authenticity of the Letters of a Portuguese Nun and showed 
Marianna Alcoforado to be their authoress. Excellent critical 
work was also done by Moniz Barreto, whose early, death was a 
serious loss to letters. 

In scientific literature hardly a single department lacks a name 
of repute even outside Portugal. The press has accompanied 
the general progress, and ever since Herculano founded and 
wrote in the Panorama, the leading writers have almost without 



exception made both name and livelihood by writing for the 
papers, but as pure journalists none has excelled Antonio 
Rodriguez Sampaio, Antonio Augusto Teixeira dc Vasconcellos 
and Emygdio Navarro, 

The leading Portuguese orators of the 19th century, with the 
exception of Malhao, were not churchmen, as in the past, but 
politicians. The early days of parliamentary rule 
produced ManocI Fernandes Thomas and Manoel 0rator y* 
Borges Carneiro, but the most brilliant period was that of the 
first twenty-five years of constitutional government after 1834, 
and the historic names are those of Garrett, Manoel da Silva 
Passos, and the great tribune and - apostle of liberty, Jose 
Estevao Coelho de Magalhaes. The ill-fated Vieira de Castro 
excited the greatest admiration by his impassioned speeches 
in the Chamber of Deputies during the 'sixties; the nearest 
modern counterpart to these distinguished men is the orator 
Antonio Candido Ribeiro da Costa. 

Bibliography. — The corner-stones are the Bibliotheca Lusitana 
of Barbosa Machado and the Diccionario bibliographico portuguez, 
by Innocencio da Silva, with Brito Aranha's supplement ; while the 
Bibliotheca Hispana Nova of Nicolao Antonio (1783-1788) may also 
be referred to. Subsidiary to these are the Manual bibliographico 
portuguez of Dr Pinto de Mattos, the admirable Catalogo razonado 
de los Autores Portugueses que escribieron en Castcllano, compiled 
by Garcia Peres (1890), and such publications as Figamere's 
Catalogo dos Manuscriftos portuguezes no Muscu Britannico (1853). 
The only full general history of the literature comes from the prolific 
pen of Dr Theophilo Braga (second and revised edition in 32 vols.). 
The volumes positively^ bulge with information and contain much 
acute criticism, but their value is diminished by frequent and need- 
less digressions and by the fantastic theorizings of their author, a 
militant Positivist. Of one-volume books on the same subject, 
Dr Braga's Curso da Historia da Litteratura portugueza and his 
Theoria da Historia da Litteratura portugueza (3rd ed., 1881) may be 
-recommended, though the plainer Historia da Litteratura portu- 
gueza, by Dr Mendes dos Remedios (3rd ed., 1908) has the consider- 
able advantage for foreign students of including a large number 
of selected passages from the authors named. See also the Chresto- 
tnathia archaica of J. J. Nunes (1905). Among foreign studies 
the palm must be given to the " Geschichte der portugiesischen 
Litteratur " by the eminent scholar, Mme Michaelis dc Vasconcellos, 
in the Grundrtss der rom. Philologie of Grober (1893-1894). Among 
genera] critical studies are Costa e Silva's Ensaio biographico-critico 
and the masterly work of Menendez y Pelayo, Historia de las ideas 
estaticas en EspaHa. 

Coming to special periods, the student may consult, for the 
cancioneiros, Mme Michaelis de Vasconcellos, op. cit., and her 
great edition of the Cancionciro da Ajuda (1901); also H. R. Lang, 
Das Liederbuch der Konigs Denis von Portugal (1894). Lopes de 
Mendonca treats of the literature of the 16th and 17th centuries 
in articles in the Annaes das sciencias e letras; and the Memorias de 
litteratura portugueza printed by the Lisbon Academy of Sciences 
(1702-1814) contain essays on the drama and the Arcadia, but the 
19th century has naturally received most attention. For that 
period, see Lopes de Mendonca, Mcmoiras da litteratura contem- 
poranea (1855); Romero Ortiz, La Literatura portugueza en el siglo 
XIX. (1869), containing much undigested information; and Maxime 
Formont, Le Mouvement poHioue contemporain en Portugal, an able 
sketch; but the soundest review is due to Moniz Barreto, whose 
" Litteratura portugueza contemporanea " came out in the Revista 
de Portugal for July 1889. Students of the modern novel in Portugal 
should refer to the essays of J. Pereira de Sampaio (" Bruno ") 
A Geracao Nova (1886). 

Portugal still lacks a collection equivalent to Rivadeneyra's 
Biblioteca de autores espanoles, contenting itself with the Par* 
nasso lusitano (6 vols., 1826) and a Corpus illustrium poetarum 
lusitanorum qui Mine scripscrunt (1745-1748), and though much 
has been accomplished to make the classics more available, even yet 
no correct, not to say critical, texts of many notable writers exist. 
The Cancionciro de Ajuda by Mme Vasconcellos, is the perfection 
of editing, and there are diplomatic editions of other cancioneiros, 




and the Cancionciro Geral (1846). The Romanceiro portuguez of 
V. E. Hardung is incomplete. (E. Pr.) 

PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA, or Mozambique. This Por- 
tuguese possession, bounded E. by the Indian Ocean, N. by- 
German East Africa, \V. by the Nyasaland Protectorate, Rho- 
desia and the Transvaal, S. by Tongaland (Natal), has an area 
of 293,500 sq. m. It is divided in two by the river Zamhezi. 
The northern portion, between the ocean and Lake Nyasa and 
the Shire river, is a compact block of territory, squarish in

shape, being about 400 m. long by 360 m. broad. South of the 
Zambezi the province consists of a strip of land along the 
coast varying from 50 to 200 m. in depth. Along the Zambezi 
itself Portuguese territory extends west as far as the Loangwa 
confluence, some 600 m. by river. 

Physical Features, — The coast-line extends from 26 52' S. to io° 
40' S., and from south to north makes a double curve with a general 
trend outward, i.e. to the east. It has a length of 1430 m. Some 
40 m. north of the Natal (Tongoland) frontier is the deep indentation 
of Delagoa Bay {q.v.). The land then turns outward to Cape Cor- 
rientes, a little north of which is Inhambane Bay. Bending westward 
again and passing several small islands, of which the chief is Bazaruto, 
Sofala Bay is reached. Northward the Zambezi with a wide delta 
pours its waters into the ocean. From this point onward the coast 
is studded with small islands, mainly of coral formation. On one 
of these islands is Mozambique, and immediately north of that port 
• is Conducia Bay. Somewhat farther north are two large bays — 
Fernao Veloso and Memba. There is a great difference in the charac- 
ter of the coast north and south of Mozambique. To the north the 
coast is much indented, abounds in rocky headlands and rugged 
cliffs while, as already stated, there is an almost continuous fringe 
of islands. South of Mozambique the coast-line is low, sandy 
and lined with mangrove swamps. Harbours are few and poor. 
The difference in character of these two regions arises from the fact 
that in the northern half the ocean current which flows south between 
Madagascar and the mainland is close to the coast, and scours out 
all the softer material, while at the same time the coral animalcules 
are building in deep waters. But south of Mozambique the ocean 
current forsakes the coast, allowing the accumulation of sand 
and alluvial matter. North of Fernao Veloso and Memba the largest 
bays are Pemba (where there is commodious anchorage for heavy 
draught vessels), Montepuesi and Tunghi, the last named having 
for its northern arm Cape Delgado, the limit of Portuguese territory. 

Orographically the backbone of the province is^ the mountain 
chain which forms the eastern escarpment of the continental plateau. 
It does not present a uniformly abrupt descent to the plains, but in 
places — as in the lower Zambezi district — slopes gradually to the 
coast. The Lebombo Mountains, behind Delagoa Bay, nowhere 
exceed 2070 ft. in height; the Manica plateau, farther north, 
is higher. Mt Doe rises to 7875 ft.^ and Mt Panga to 7610 ft. 
The Gorongoza massif with Mt Miranga .(6550 ft.), Enhatete 
(6o5oft.),andGogogo (5900 ft.) lies north-east of the Manica plateau, 
and is, like it, of granitic formation. Gorongoza, rising isolated 
with precipitous outer slopes, has been likened in its aspect to a 
frowning citadel. The chief mountain range, however, lies north 
of the Zambezi, and east of Lake Chilwa, namely, the Namuli 
Mountains, in which Namuli Peak rises to 8860 ft., and Molisani, 
Mruli and Mresi attain altitudes of 6500 to 8000 ft. These moun- 
tains are covered with magnificent forests. Farther north the river 
basins are divided by well-marked ranges with heights of 3000 ft. 
and over. Near the south-east shore of Nyasa there is a high range 
(5000 to 6000 ft.) with an abrupt descent to the lake— ^some 3000 ft. 
in six miles. The country between Nyasa and Ibo is remarkable 
for the number of fantastically shaped granite peaks which rise 
from the plateau. The plateau lands west of the escarpment are 
of moderate elevation — perhaps averaging 2000 to 2500 ft. It 
is, however, only along the Zambezi and north of that river that 
Portuguese territory reaches to the continental plateau. 

Besides the Zambezi (q.v.) the most considerable river in Portu- 
guese East Africa is the Limpopo {q.v.) which enters the Indian 
Ocean about 100 m. north of Delagoa Bay. The Komati (q.v.) r 
Sabi, Busi and Pungwe south of the Zambezi; the Lukugu, Lurio, 
Montepuesi (Mtepwesi) and Msalu, with the Rovuma {q.v.) and its 
affluent the Lujenda, to the north of it, are the other rivers of the 
province with considerable drainage areas. The Sabi rises in 
Mashonaland at an altitude of over 3000 ft., and after flowing south 
for over 200 m. turns east and pierces the mountains some 170 m. 
from the coast, being joined near the Anglo-Portuguese frontier 
by the Lundi. Cataracts entirely prevent navigation above this 
point. Below the Lundi confluence the bed of the Sabi becomes 
considerably broader, varying from half a mile to two miles. ^ In the 
rainy season the Sabi is a large stream and even in the " dries " it 
can be navigated from its mouth by shallow draught steamers for 
over 150 m. Its general direction through Portuguese^ territory 
is east by north. At its mouth it forms a delta 60 m. in extent. 
The Busi (220 m.) and Pungwe (180 m.) are streams north of and 
similar in character to the Sabi. They both rise in the Manica 
plateau and enter the ocean in Pungwe Bay, their mouths but a 
mile or two apart. The lower reaches of both streams are navigable, 
the Busi for 25 m., the Pungwe for about 100 m. At the mouth of 
the Pungwe is the port of Beira. Of the north-Zambezi streams 
the Lukugu, rising in the hills south-east of Lake Chilwa, flows south 
and enters the ocean not far north of Quilimane. The Lurio, rising 
in the Namuli Mountains, flows north-east, having a course of 
some 200 m. The Montepuesi and the Msalu drain the country 
between the Lurio and Rovuma basins. Their banks are in general 
well defined and the wet season rise seems fairly constant. 



Geology, — The central plateau consists of gneisses, granites and 
schists of the usual East African type which in part or in whole are 
to be referred to the Archaean system. The next oldest rocks belong 
to the Karroo period. Their principal occurrence is in the Zambezi 
basin, where at Tetc they contain workable seams of coal, and have 
yielded plant remains indicating a Lower Karroo or Upper Carboni- 
ferous age. Sandstones and shales, possibly of Upper Karroo age, 
form a narrow belt at the edge of the foot-plateau. Upper Cretaceous 
rocks crop out from beneath the superficial deposits along the coast 
belt between Delagoa Bay and Mozambique. The Cenomanian 
period is represented in Conducia by the beds with Puzosia and 
AcanlkoceraSy and in Sofala and Busi by the beds with Alectryonia 
ungulata and Exogyra columba. The highest Cretaceous strata 
occur in Conducia, where they contain the huge ammonite Pachy- 
discus conduciensis. The Eocene formation is well represented in 
Gazaland by the nummuiitic limestones which have been found to 
extend for a considerable distance inland. Basalts occur at several 
localities in the Zambezi basin. On the flanks of Mount Milanje 
there are two volcanic cones which would appear to be of compara- 
tively recent date; but the most interesting igneous rocks are the 
rhyolitic lavas of the Lebombo range. 

Climate. — The climate is unhealthy on the coast and along the 
banks of the Zambezi, where malaria is endemic. With moderate 
care, however, Europeans are able to enjoy tolerably good health. 
On the uplands and the plateaus the climate is temperate and 
healthy. At Tete, on the lower Zambezi, the annual mean tempera- 
ture is 77-9° F., the hottest month being November, 83*3°, and 
the coldest J[uly, 72*5°. At Quilimane, on the coast, the mean 
temperature is 85*1°, maximum 106-7° and minimum 49-1°. The 
cool season is from April to August. The rainy season lasts from 
December to March, and the dry season from May to the end of 
September. November is a month of light rains. During the mon- 
soons the districts bordering the Mozambique Channel enjoy a 
fairly even mean temperature of 76*1°, maximum mean 88-7 , and 
minimum mean 65*3°. 

Fauna. — The fauna is rich, game in immense variety being 
plentiful in most districts. The carnivora include the lion, both 
of the yellow and black-maned varieties, leopard, spotted hyena, 
jackal, serval, civet cat, genet, hunting dog {Lycaon pictus) in the 
Mozambique district, mongoose and spotted otter, the last-named 
rare. Of ungulata the elephant is plentiful, though large tuskers are 
not often shot. The black rhinoceros is also common, and south of 
the Zambezi are a few specimens of white rhinoceros {R. simus). 
The rivers and marshes are the home of numerous hippopotami, 
which have, however, deserted the lower Zambezi. The wart-hog 
and the smaller red hog are common. A species of zebra is plentiful, 
and herds of buffalo {Bos caffer)are numerous in the plains and in 
open woods. Of antelopes the finest are the eland and sable antelope. 
The kudu is rare. Waterbuck, hartebeeste (Bubalislichiensteini), 
brindled gnu and tsescbe (south of the Zambezi, replaced north of 
that river by the lechwe and puku), reedbuck, bushbuck, impala, 
duiker, klipspringer and oribi are all common. The giraffe is not 
found within the province. Of edentata the scaly ant-eater and 
porcupine are numerous. Among rodentia hares and rabbits are 
abundant. There are several kinds of monkeys and lemuroids, 
but the anthropoids are absent. Crocodiles, lizards, chameleons, 
land and river tortoises are all very numerous, as are pythons 
(some 18 ft. long), cobras, puff-adders and vipers. Centipedes and 
scorpions and insects are innumerable. Among insects mosquitos, 
locusts, the tsetse fly, the hippo-fly, cockroaches, phylloxera, ter- 
mites, soldier ants and flying ants arc common plagues. As has been 
indicated, # the Zambezi forms a dividing line not crossed by 
certain animals, so that the fauna north of that river presents some 
marked contrasts with that to the south. 

Bird-life is abundant. Among the larger birds flamingoes are 
especially common in the Mozambique district. Cranes, herons, 
storks, pelicans and ibises are numerous, including the beautiful 
crested crane and the saddle-billed stork {Myctena senegalensis), 
the last-named comparatively rare. The eagle, vulture, kite, 
buzzard and crow are well represented, though the crested eagle is 
not found. Of game birds the guinea fowl, partridge, bustard, 
quail, wild goose, teal, widgeon, mallard and other kinds of duck 
arcall common. Other birds numerously represented are parrots 
(chiefly a smallish green bird — the grey parrot is not found), ravens, 
hornbills, buntings, finches, doves, a variety of cuckoo, small wag- 
tails, a starling with a beautiful burnished bronze-green plumage, 
spur- winged plovers, stilt birds, ruffs and kingfishers. 

Flora. — The flora is varied and abundant, though the custom of 
the natives to burn the grass during the dry season gives to large 
areas for nearly half the year a blackened, desolate appearance. 
Six varieties of palms are found — the coco-nut, raphia, wild date, 
borassus (or fan palm), hyphaene and Phoenix spinosa. The coco- 
nut is common in the coast regions and often attains 100 ft. ; the date 
palm, found 'mostly in marshy ground and by the banks of small 
rivers, is seldom more than 20 ft. in height. Of themany timber 
trees a kind of cedar is found in the lower forests; ironwood and 
ebony are common, and other trees resemble satin and rosewood. 
The Khaya senegalensis, a very large tree found in ravines and by 
river banks, affords durable and easily-worked timber; there are

several varieties of vitex and of ficus, notably the sycamore, 'which 
bears an edible fruit. Excellent hardwood is obtained from a 
species of grewia. Other characteristic trees are the mangrove 
(along the sea shore), sandal- wood, gum cepal, baobab and 
bombax, and, in the lower plain, dracaenas (dragon trees), 
candalabra euphorbia, and many species of creepers and flowering 
shrubs. The thorny smilax and many other prickly creepers and 
shrubs are abundant. Acacias are numerous, including the gum- 
yielding variety, while landolphia rubber vines grow freely in the 
forests. Among plants of economic value the coffee, cotton, 
indigo and tobacco plants are found, as well as the castor oil and other 
oleaginous plants. Bananas, mangoes and pineapples grow in 
great profusion. Among flowers crinum lilies, lotus, gentians, 
gladioli, lobelias, violets (scentless), red and yellow immortelles 
(confined to the higher elevations) and yellow and blue amomums 
are common. Of grasses the bamboo is common. Phragmiles 
communis, spear grass, with its waving, snowy plumes, grows 12 to 
14 ft. and is abundant along the river banks and along the edges of 
the marshes. (For the flora of the Nyasa region see British Central 
Africa.) 

Inhabitants. — Portuguese East Africa is sparsely inhabited, 
the estimated population (1909) being 3,120,000; 90% 
of the inhabitants belong to various Bantu tribes, from whose 
ranks most of the natives employed in the Transvaal gold 
mines are recruited. The most important in the northern half 
of the province are the Yaos (q.v.) and the Ma Kua (Makwa). 
The Makwa, notwithstanding the presence of Arabs, Banyans 
(Hindus) and Battias in all the coast districts, have preserved 
in a remarkable degree their purity of race, although their 
language has undergone considerable change (see Bantu 
Languages). Most of the country between the Rovuma and 
the Zambezi is populated by branches of this race, governed 
by numerous petty chiefs. The Makwa are divided into four 
families or groups — the Low Makwa, the Lomwe or Upper 
Makwa, the Maua and the Medo. Yao possess the country 
between the Msalu river and Nyasa. The dominant race be- 
tween the Zambezi and the Mazoe are the Tavala, other tribes 
in the same region being the Maravi, Senga, Muzimba and 
Muzuzuro. They are mainly of Zulu origin. Between the Zambezi 
and the Pungwe are the Barue, Batoka, &c. In the district 
south of the Pungwe river, known as Gazaland, the ruling tribes, 
are of Zulu origin, all other tribes of different stock being known 
as Tongas. For the most part these Tongas resemble the 
Basutos. They are of peaceful disposition. They occupy 
themselves with stock-raising and agriculture. The white 
inhabitants numbered about 9000 in 1909. They are chiefly 
Portuguese and British and nearly a half live in Lourenco 
Marques. There are many Portuguese half-castes. 

Chief Towns. — The chief towns are Lourenco Marques, 
Mozambique, Quilimane, Inhambane, Beira, Chinde and Sofala, 
all separately noticed. The other European settlements are 
Chingune (see Sofala), Angoxa and Ibo on the coast, and Sena, 
Tete and Zumbo on the Zambezi. Angoxa lies midway between 
Quilimane and Mozambique, dates from the 17th century, and 
is a small and little frequented port. Ibo, founded by the Portu- 
guese at the beginning of the 17th century, is built on an 
island, likewise called Ibo, in 12 20' S., 40 38' E. off the northern 
arm of Montepuesi Bay, and 180 m. north of Mozambique. Ibo 
Island is one of a group known as the Querimba archipelago. 
The harbour is sheltered but shallow. The town attained 
considerable dimensions in the 17th century and was made the 
headquarters of the Cape Dclgado district in the 18th century. 
The most prominent buildings are two forts, one disused. The 
other, called San Joao, is star-shaped and was built, according to 
an inscription over the gateway, in 1791. The Zambezi towns 
(Sena, Tete and Zumbo) mark the limits of penetration made 
by the Portuguese inland. Comparatively important places 
in the 17th and early part of the 18th centuries, with the 
decline of Portuguese power they fell into a ruinous condition. 
The opening up of Rhodesia and British Central Africa in the 
last quarter of the 19th century gave them renewed life. Sena, 
some 150 m. by river from Chinde, is built at the foot of a 
hill on the southern side of the Zambezi, from which it is 
now distant 2 m., though in the middle of the 16th century 
the river flowed by it. Sena possesses an 18th-century fort, a 



modern government house and a church dedicated to St 
Marcal. 

Tete, founded about the same time as Sena, is also on the 
south bank of the Zambezi. It is about 140 m. by the river 
above Sena. Since 1894 there has been a regular service of 
steamers between Tete and Chinde. Of the ancient town little 
remains save the strongly-built fort and the church. The new 
town dates from about i860, when there was a revival of the 
trade in gold dust and ivory. This trade, however, became practi- 
cally extinct by 1903; the gold dust traffic through exhaustion 
of supplies, and the ivory trade through diversion to other 
routes. A transit trade to British possessions north and south 
of Tete has been developed, and in 1906 some gold mines in the 
neighbourhood began crushing ore. Zumbo is picturesquely 
situated just below the Loangwe confluence and commands large 
stretches of navigable water on the Loangwe and middle Zambezi. 
The 17th-century town was deserted in consequence of the 
hostility of the natives. In 1859 David Livingstone found 
on its site nothing but the ruins of a few houses. Since then 
a new settlement has been made, and Zumbo has acquired some 
transit trade with Rhodesia. 

On the line of railway from Beira to Rhodesia the most 
important town is Massi Kessi (Portuguese Macequece) in the 
centre of the Manica goldfields. It lies 2500 ft. above the sea, 
194 m. north-west of Beira by rail, and is close to the British 
frontier. Along the railway from Lourenco Marques to the 
Transvaal frontier are stations marking the* position of small 
settlements. The last Portuguese station is named Ressano 
Garcia; the first Transvaal station Komati Poort. 

Communications. — The Zambezi is navigable by light draught 
steamers throughout its course in Portuguese territory with one 
break at the Kebrassa Rapids — 400 m. from its mouth. By means 
of the Shire^ affluent of the Zambezi there is direct steamer and rail- 
way connexion with British Central Africa. _ The navigability of the 
other rivers of the province has been indicated. From Lourenco 
Marques railways run to Swaziland and the Transvaal, and from 
Beira there is a railway to Rhodesia. These lines, built to foster 
trade with countries lieyond Portuguese territory, link the ports 
named to the British railway systems in South and Central Africa. 
The route for a railway to connect Beira with Sena was surveyed 
in 1906-1907, a route from Quilimane to the Zambezi being also 
surveyed. A light railway (50 m. long) goes inland from Matamba, 
on- Inhambane Bay, serving northern Gazaland. Native caravan 
routes traverse every part of the country, but these are mere tracks, 
and in general communication is difficult and slow. 

Lourenco Marques, Beira, Mozambique and other ports are in 
telegraphic communication with Europe via South Africa and 
Zanzibar, and a cable connects Mozambique with Madagascar. 
Inland telegraph lines connect the ports with the adjacent British 
possessions. British, German and Portuguese steamship lines 
maintain regular communication between Lourenco Marques and 
other ports and Europe and India. In 1908 some 1700 vessels of 
3,400,000 tons visited the ports of the province. 

Agriculture and Otlter Industries. — The country from the Rovuma 
to the Zambezi is of great fertility, the richest portion being that 
between Angoxa and Quilimane. In*the basin of the Zambezi the 
soil is fertilized by the inundations of the river. The low coast 
land of the Gaza country is almost equally fruitful. A great part 
of the country is suitable for the growth of the sugar-cane, rice, 
ground-nuts, coffee and tobacco. The two last named plants, as 
also cotton, vanilla, tea and cloves, are not a success in the Quili- 
mane region, where coco-nuts and ground-nuts are the chief crops. 
Rubber vines are largely grown in the Mozambique district and the 
Mozambique Company has lar^e plantations of coffee and sugar. 
There are numerous sugar factories and rice plantations in the Zam- 
bezi district. The natives devote their attention to the raising of 
oleaginous crops and of maize, cassava, beans, &c. Wheat and other 
cereals are grown in the valley of the Zambezi. Large herds of 
cattle are raised. The system prevails in many districts of dividing 
the land into prazos (large agricultural estates) in which the natives 
cultivate various crops for the benefit of the European leaseholder, 
who is also tax-collector for his district and can claim the tax either 
in labour or produce. 

Fish are plentiful along the coast, and pearls are obtained off the 
Bazaruto Isles. Turtles are caught in the Querimba archipelago. 
Spirits, sugar, fibres and pottery are practically the only commodi- 
ties manufactured. The hunting of game for ivory and skins affords 
employment to large numbers of people. 

Mineral Resources. — There are immense deposits of coal in the 
neighbourhood of Tete and near Dela^oa Bay, and adjoining the 
coalfields ironstone of the best quality is plentiful. Malachite and 
copper are found in the interior, north-west of Mozambique. The 



i66 



PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA 



whole of the region north of Delagoa Bay to the Zambezi and inland 
to and beyond the Portuguese frontier is auriferous, and ancient gold 
workings abound. Many writers have sought to identify this region 
with the land of Ophir. In Manica several gold mines are worked. 
In 1906-1907 a rich formation similar to the American " placer " 
deposits was discovered in the Manica goldfields. Gold mines are 
also worked at Missale and Chifumbaze, to the north of Tete. The 
Missale mines are just south of the frontier of British Central Africa. 
Petroleum is found near lnhambane, as is also a curious elastic- 
like substance named inhangellite, resembling bitumen, chiefly de- 
rived from masses of a gelatinous alga (see Kew Bulletin, No. 5, 
1907). 

Commerce. — The chief exports are rubber, sugar, coal (from the 
Transvaal), beeswax, coco-nuts, copra and mangrove bark, ivory 
(including hippopotamus teeth and rhinoceros horns), skins and 
hides, ground-nuts, and oilseeds, monkey-nuts, mealies, cattle (to 
Madagascar), cotton, tobacco, gold and other minerals. The prin- 
cipal imports for consumption in the province are cotton goods, 
hardware and foodstuffs. The " Kaffir " trade is largely in cheap 
wines of a highly deleterious character, blankets, hats and shoes, 
brass wire and Venetian beads. Immense quantities of cheap wine 
are bought by the natives. There is at Lourenco Marques and at 
Beira a large transit trade to and from the Transvaal and Rhodesia 
respectively. The average annual value of the external trade of 
the province for the five years 1 901-1905 was about £5,500,000. 
In 1909 the total trade of the province — including re-exports and 
goods in transit — exceeded £10,000,000. Fully 50% of this trade 
was in transit to or from the Transvaal. (See further Lourenco 
Marques; Beira, &c.) The trade of the province is chiefly with 
Great Britain, India, Germany and Portugal. # The retail trade both 
at the seaports and in the settlements inland is largely in the hands 
of British Indians — Banyans, Battias and Parsees. 

On the coast there are several native ports of call, between which 
and Madagascar a large surreptitious trade in slaves was carried on 
until 1877. With this island, and also with Zanzibar, there is a 
large general coasting trade. 

Administration, Revenue, &c. — Formerly called Mozambique, 
the province since 1 891 bears the official title of State of East Africa. 
It is under a governor-general, appointed for three years, and for 
administrative purposes is divided into several districts. There is 
a government council, instituted in 1907, composed partly of officials 
and partly of elected representatives of the commercial, industrial 
and agricultural communities. There is also a provincial coun- 
cil " with the attributions^ of an administrative and account 
tribunal." In each district is a subsidiary council. The 
governor-general resides at Lourenco Marques and has under his 
immediate direction the Delagoa Bay district. Gazaland (q.v.) 
and the district of lnhambane are also governed directly by Portu- 
guese officials. The greater part of the country between the Sabi 
River and the Zambezi, including the Manica and Sofala regions, 
is administered, under a charter granting sovereign rights for 50 years 
from 1 89 1, by the Companhia de Mozambique, which has its head- 
quarters at Beira. The Quilimane, Chinde and Zambezi regions 
are administered by representatives of the governor-general, with 
headquarters at "Mozambique. The Zambezi Company has large 
trading concessions over this district. North of the Quilimane 
district the coast region and adjacent islands go under the name of 
Angoxa. The territory between the Lurio and Rovuma rivers and 
Lake Nyasa is governed by the Companhia do Nyasa under a royal 
charter. Revenue is obtained largely from customs and a hut 
tax on natives. The annual revenue of the province is about 
£1,000,000. A military force, about 4000 strong, is maintained, 
including 1200 to 1400 Europeans. Education is chiefly in the 
hands of Roman Catholic missionaries. 

History. — It is uncertain at what period the east coast of 
Africa south of Somaliland was first visited by the maritime 
races of. the east. There is, however, no reason to doubt that 
by the 10th century a.d. the Arabs had occupied the seaboard 
as far south as Sofala, and that they carried on an active trade 
between East Africa and Arabia, the Persian Gulf and India. 
The Arabs built fine towns and exercised control over the coast 
peoples, but do not appear to have pushed their conquests 
far inland. They had extensive commercial dealings, chiefly 
in gold, ivory and slaves, with the Bantu potentates who ruled 
over the middle Zambezi valley and the country now known 
as Mashonaland. Until the close of the 15th century the Arab 
supremacy was unchallenged. But in 1498 Vasco da Gama 
entered the mouth of a river which he called Rio dos Bons 
Sinaes (River of Good Tokens), as there he first found himself 
in contact with the civilization of the East. This stream was 
the Quilimane River, taken by the Portuguese a little later to 
be the main mouth of the Zambezi. From this river da Gama 
continued his voyage, putting in at Mozambique and Mombasa 
on his way to India. Hostilities between the Arabs and Portu- 



guese'broke out almost immediately; da Gama, indeed, in his 
first voyage had some trouble with the sultan of Mozambique. 
In 1502 da Gama paid a visit to Sofala to make inquiries 
concerning the trade in gold carried on at that place, and the 
reports as to its wealth which reached Portugal led to the 
despatch in 1505 of a fleet of six ships under Pedro da Nhaya 
with instructions to establish Portuguese influence at Sofala. Da 
Nhaya was allowed to build a fort close to the Arab town. The 
fort 7 built in three months, was shortly afterwards attacked by 
a band of Bantus, who acted on the instigation of the Arabs. 
The attackers were driven off and the Arabs forced to acknow- 
ledge Portuguese rule. In 1509 a captain of Sofala and a factor, 
or chief trader, were sent out, and from this time the trade of 
the port fell to the Portuguese. Sofala, however, was not a 
suitable harbour for the refitting and provisioning of ships on 
the way to India, and to obtain such a port Mozambique was 
seized and fortified in 1507-. By 1510 the Portuguese were 
masters of all the former Arab sultanates on the East African coast. 
The northern half of this region, from Kilwa to Mukdishu, has 
passed out of their possession; here it is only necessary to out- 
line the history of the country still under the Portuguese Crown. 

For forty years Sofala was their only station south of the 
Zambezi. Thence they traded with the monomotapa or chief 
of the " Mocaranga " (i.e. the Makalanga or Karanga) in whose 
territory were the mines whence the gold exported from Sofala 
was obtained. At that time this chief was a powerful potentate 
exercising authority over a wide area (see Monomotapa). The 
efforts made by the Portuguese from Sofala to reach him were 
unsuccessful. It was probably the desire to penetrate to the 
"land of gold" by an easier route that led, in 1544, to the 
establishment of a station on the River of Good Tokens, a station 
from which grew the town of Quilimane. About the same 
time the Portuguese penetrated inland along the Zambezi, 
known then as the River of Sena, and founded the trading 
ports of Sena and Tete, or, perhaps, annexed already existing 
Arab towns of those names. It was at this period also that 
Lourenco Marques and a companion, sent out by the captain 
of Mozambique, entered Delagoa Bay and opened up trade 
with the natives. This was the most southerly point occupied 
by the Portuguese. For three centuries however the fine har- 
bour was little used, and its ultimate development was due 
to the discovery of another " land of gold " — the Witwaters- 
rand — beyond Portuguese territory. In the 16th century the 
Portuguese turned their energies towards the Zambezi valley. 
In 1569 their East African dominions, hitherto dependent on 
the viceroyalty of India, were made a separate government 
with headquarters at Mozambique. 

Francisco Barreto, a former viceroy of India, appointed 
governor of the newly formed province, was instructed by King 
Sebastian to conquer the country of the gold mines. The route 
via the Zambezi, and not that by Sofala, was chosen by Bar- 
reto — in opposition to the desires of his council, but in accord 
with the advice of a Dominican friar named De Monclares. 
This advice proved fatal owing to the deadly climate of the 
Zambezi valley. Barreto's expedition, including over 1000 
Europeans, started in November 1569, and from Sena marched 
south, an arrangement having been come to with the monomo- 
tapa by which the Portuguese were granted a right of way to 
the gold mines on condition of their attacking a rebel vassal of 
that chieftain. Barreto attacked and defeated this rebel, but 
received no help from the monomotapa, and his force was so 
greatly weakened by deaths and disease that he was obliged to 
return to Sena, whence he went to Mozambique to put down 
disorder among the Portuguese there. He returned to Sena 
in 1570, only to die a few days after his arrival. His successor 
Vasco Fernandes Homem, got together another expedition and 
made his way inland from Sofala to a region where he saw the 
ground being worked for gold. The comparative poorness of 
the mine filled him, it is stated, with disappointment, and he 
returned to Sofala. Thus these, the most important efforts 
made by the Portuguese to obtain possession of the interior, 
ended in failure. 



PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA

Towards the end of the 16th century the Portuguese posts 
on the Zambezi were attacked by hordes of savages known as 
Muzimba, and Tetc and Sena were destroyed. The captain- 
general of Mozambique — the province had been again attached 
to the Indian viceroyalty — was only able to make peace on 
promise not to interfere with matters which concerned only the 
native tribes. Thereafter the Portuguese often had to defend 
even the coast towns from attacks by the Bantus. Still they 
held one or two posts in the interior besides those on the Zam- 
bezi. Of these the chief appears to have been Masapa, on the 
river Mansovo, i.e. Mazoe, in what is now Mashonaland, and 
about 150 m. by road from Tete. Near Masapa dwelt the 
monomotapa, an insignificant chieftain, the power of the Maka- 
ianga having been broken by revolts of once subject tribes and 
by dissensions among the Makalanga themselves. In 1629 a 

» treaty was concluded with a claimant to the chieftainship who 
embraced Christianity. This man, known as the Monomotapa 
Filippe, declared himself a vassal of Portugal, and with the help 
of Dominican friars and a number of half-breeds established 
his authority. 

The Portuguese, however, failed to make any effective use 
of their East African possessions. Among the causes of their 
non-success in the years immediately following the period of con- 
quest must be reckoned the "Sixty Years' Captivity" (1580- 
1640), when the Spanish and Portuguese crowns were united, 
and the neglect of Africa for the richer possessions in India and 
the Far East. A more important and permanent reason for the 
non-development of Mozambique province was its unhealthy 
and enervating climate, which prevented European colonization. 
The few thousands of Portuguese who went out were chiefly 
officials, and they and the small body of planters led in general 
a life of indolence and debauchery. Commerce too was ham- 
pered and good government rendered impossible through the 
system of farming out the administration to officials who were 
in return granted a monopoly of trade, and even when this 
system was abandoned trade was confined to Portuguese sub- 
jects. 1 But for many years the Jesuits and Dominicans were 
unceasing in their endeavours to win the native races to 
Christianity, the friars being the most energetic section of the 
white community. The first Jesuit missionaries began work in 
the province in the neighbourhood of Inhambane in 1560; in the 
same year another Jesuit, Goncalo da Silveira, made his way to 
the Zimbabwe (chief kraal) of the monomotapa, by whose orders 
he and his converts were strangled (March 16, 1561). Mission 
work was soon afterwards begun by the Dominicans and the 
two orders between them had agents spread over the greater 
part of the country from Mozambique southward. They gained 
thousands of at least nominal converts, notably the heir of one 
of the monomotapas, who was baptized in 1652 and who, 
renouncing his heirship, became vicar of the convent of Santa 
Barbara in Goa. But during the 18th century the zeal of 
the missionaries declined; in 1759 the Jesuits were expelled, 
and two years later the Dominicans were sent to Goa. At that 
time they had been, together with a few white, Goanese and 
half-caste traders, for fully a century practically the only re- 
presentatives of Portugal in the interior (the towns on the Zam- 
bezi excepted). Portugal's influence was confined to helping 
one tribe in its quarrel with another, in return for favours re- 
ceived. The Portuguese were quite unable to take advantage 
of the disunion of the natives to establish their own supremacy. 
The exhaustion and enfeeblement of Portugal had, in short, its 
natural effect in Africa. In the early years of the 18th century 
the Arabs wrested from the Portuguese their African possessions 
'north of Cape Delgado; the Dutch, French and British had been 
for some time menacing their trade and possessions in the south. 
In 1604, 1607 and again in 1662 the Dutch unsuccessfully 
attacked Mozambique, which was also attacked by the Arabs in 
1670. The merchants of Sofala and Mozambique had, since 
the middle of the 17th century, found a new source of wealth 
in the export of slaves to Brazil, a trade due directly to the 
capture of the ports of Angola by the Dutch (1640-1648), but 
1 Until 1853, when commerce was made free to all nations. 



continued until nearly the middle of the 19th century. 4 Other 
trade declined steadily, the continual state of warfare among 
the tribes of the inland plateaus greatly reducing the production 
of gold. 

In 1752 the government of the East African possessions 
was again separated from that of Goa, and twenty years later 
Francisco Jose Maria de Lacerda e Almeida, a man of high 
attainments, made governor of the province at his own request, 
endeavoured to reform the administration. Lacerda is chiefly 
remembered for his journey to the heart of Central Africa, where 
he died in October 1798. Lacerda had conceived the idea of 
establishing a chain of Portuguese posts across the continent 
from Mozambique to Angola, and his statesmanlike prescience 
was shown by his prediction that the seizure of Cape Town by 
the British would lead to the extension of British rule over 
Central Africa, thus isolating the Portuguese provinces on the 
east and west coasts. After Lacerda's death a state of apathy 
and decay was again manifest throughout Portuguese East 
Africa. During the greater part of the 19th century the country 
south of the Zambezi was devastated by hordes of savages of 
Zulu origin (see Gazaland). 

The discoveries of David Livingstone in the Zambezi basin 
in the period 1850-1865 attracted the attention of the British to 
those regions and led to the establishment of British settle- 
ments at the southern end of Lake Nyasa and in the Shire high- 
lands. These events aroused anxiety in Lisbon, which was 
increased when the British obtained a prepondering influence 
in Matabele, Mashona and Manica lands — the lands of the 
earlier monomotapas. With sudden energy the Portuguese 
engaged in the " scramble for Africa," and though the result 
was disappointing to the patriotic feelings of the people they 
secured from their powerful neighbours — Great Britain and 
Germany — much better terms than might have been antici- 
pated, having regard to the extremely limited area over which 
they exercised any sort of jurisdiction. The story of the par- 
tition is set forth fully in Africa, §5. Before the "scramble" 
began, Portugal had been fortunate in securing, in 1875, as the 
result of arbitration, complete possession of the fine harbour 
of Delagoa Bay, the southern half of which had been claimed 
by Great Britain in virtue of acts of annexation in 1823 and 
later years. 

The pressure of political events and the commercial activity 
of her rivals induced Portugal to take steps to develop the 
agricultural and mineral resources of the territory secured to 
her by international agreements. Imitating the policy of Great 
Britain, charters conveying sovereign powers were granted to 
the Mozambique Company in 1891, and to the Nyasa Company 
in 1893. Both these companies, as well as the Zambezi Company 
(which lacks a charter), undertook to open up the territory com- 
mitted to their care. In all of them British capital is largely 
engaged. The total decay of Sofala, the removal of the seat of 
government from Mozambique to Lourenco Marques, the rise 
of the last named port and of Beira (both largely dependent on 
the transit trade with British possessions), all served to mark 
the changed condition of affairs. An agreement concluded in 
1909 between the Transvaal and Portugal gave Delagoa Bay 
from 50 to 55% of the import trade with the Transvaal, the 
Portuguese agreeing further to facilitate the recruitment of 
natives in the province for work on the Rand mines. The 
development, in the early years of the 20th century, of rubber, 
rice, sugar and other plantations also gave a new impetus to

PORTUGUESE GUINEA, a Portuguese colony in West 
Africa, extending along the Guinea coast from Cape Roxo in 
12 19' N. to the Cogon estuary in io° 50' N. Inland it reaches 
to 13 40' W., being enclosed landward by French territory, the 
Casamance district of Senegal to the N., and French Guinea 
E. and S. (For map, see French West Africa.) The colony 
has an area of about 14,000 sq. m., and a population variously 
estimated at from 200,000 to 800,000. It consists largely of a 
low-lying deltaic region, together with an adjacent archipelago 
of small islands called the Bissagos. 

The coast-line is deeply indented by estuaries into which flow 
numerous rivers whose sources are in the elevated region on the 
eastern border of the colony. The largest estuary, the Geba, receives 
the river of the same name, the Mancoa, a northern affluent, and the 
Rio Grande or Comba; the last a large stream rising in the highlands 
of Futa Jallon. North of the Geba estuary is the Rio Cacheo, 
while Jn the south is the Rio Cassini, in reality an arm of the sea. 
These rivers and estuaries are connected with one another and 
with many smaller rivers by a network of lagoons ; and the Bissagos 
Islands, which lie off the Geba estuary, formed at one time part of 
the mainland. The Bissagos, protected seaward by dangerous 
breakers, consist of over thirty islands, besides many small reefs. 
The largest island, Orango, is the most southerly of the group and 
some 30 m. from the coast. Bulama and Bissao, islands of more 
importance, lie close to the mainland. The larger rivers can be 
ascended by^ vessels of considerable size for distances of 40 to 150 m., 
but navigation is rendered difficult by strong currents and the shift- 
ing nature of the channels as well as by hidden rocks and the great 
difference between high and low water. The climate is unhealthy, 
with a mean temperature of about 78 F. The rainfall is heavy, 
thunderstorms being frequent in the wet season, which lasts from 
May to October. 

Flora and Fauna. — Larpje forest regions extend behind the man- 
grove-lined lagoons. Their characteristic trees are the oil and date 
palms, the baobab, the shea-butter tree, ebony, mahogany and 
calabash trees, and the acacia. Rubber vines are fairly abundant. 
Besides the forests, densest along the river valleys, there are exten- 
sive tracts of grassland and park-like country. Fruit trees include 
the papaw, with fruit the size of ostrich eggs, the guava, custard 
apple, mango, the banana, the orange and the citron. The tobacco, 
indigo and cotton plants grow wild, and the coffee plant is also found. 
Ground-nuts and kola nuts are cultivated, and rice and millet are 
the chief crops grown. 

The elephant is found in the district between the Geba and Grande 
rivers, and hippopotamus are numerous. Other animals include 
the panther, wild boar, various antelopes, baboons, chimpanzees 
and large snakes. Crocodiles and sharks abound in the rivers. 
Birds include the pelican, heron, marabout, the trumpet bird and 
innumerable yellow parrots. Partridges and woodcock are also 



found. The hills of the termites are a notable feature in many 
parts of the country. 

Inhabitants. — The people of the interior are mostly Mandingo 
(q.v.) and Fula (q.v.). The coast regions and the islands are inhabited 
by negro tribes which live side by side without mixing, each pre- 
serving their own customs, dress, language and type. They exhibit 
great attachment to the soil and are profoundly religious, being 
noted specialty for their respect for family life and ancestral worship. 
Neither Christianity nor Mahommedanism has made much headway 
among them. Going from south to north the chief tribes are the 
Nalu, who dwell by the^ Cassini and are keen traders and lovers of 
peace; the Biafare or Biaffade, who occupy the region between the 
sea and the Rio Grande and jealously guard their country from 
strangers; the Bulam (Mankaie), living in the island of Bulama, and 
much given to adorning their bodies by long cuts formed into 
patterns; the Balanta, a piratical folk inhabiting the banks of the 
Geba; the Papel of the island of Bissao, formerly cannibals, an 
industrious agricultural tribe which furnishes the majority of the 
educated Africans employed by the Portuguese; the Manjak or 
Mandjago, and abranch of the Felup peoples, these last living near 
the Rio Cacheo in savage isolation and much given to waylaying 
and pillaging strangers. The Manjak inhabit the country between 
the Mancoa and the Cacheo, and the neighbouring islands. They 
are a hospitable and clever people, very adaptable, do not object 
to leaving their tribal lands, and are said to keep their word. 
Excellent seamen, good artisans and sharp traders, they maintain 
a sort of feudal system. Their houses are surrounded by walls, 
which are pierced with loopholes and provided with towers at the 
angles. The rooms are built round a courtyard. They examine the 
entrails of fowl to foretell good or evil events. The burial customs 
are elaborate. The body is smoked and, the skin having been 
removed, it is sewn up in a number of pagns (native cloths) and placed 
in a coffin fastened by gilded nails. Bright tissues are wrapped 
round the coffin, on which are hung little bells of copper and small 
brass mirrors. The seaward islands of the Bissagos are inhabited 
by an independent and warlike tribe of fishers and pirates called 
Bidiogos. Their women wear a short skirt made of palm leaves. 

The natives who adopt Portuguese names and w T ho form the 
bulk of the townsmen in the European settlements are called 
Gurmettes. They furnish the levies with which the authorities 
occasionally make war on the native tribes. The chief centres of 
trade are Bissao, on the island of the same name, which is sur- 
rounded by old fortifications; Cacheo, on the Rio Cacheo, also 
fortified; and Bulama (Boulam) on Bulama Island, the seat of the 
government. The European population consists of a few Portu- 
guese officials, soldiers, traders and convicts, and a few traders of 
other nationalities. 

Hislory. — Bulama Island was discovered by Portuguese 
navigators in 1446, but was not formally claimed by Portugal 
until 1752, about which. time she founded a station at Bissao, 
while in 1669 a post had been established on the Rio Grande. 
In 1870 a claim made by Great Britain to Bulama and a part of 
the mainland was disallowed by the arbitrator appointed (Presi- 
dent Grant of the U.S.A.). The inland limits of the Portuguese 
sphere were fixed by a convention concluded with France in 
1886, and the frontier was delimited during 1900-1903. Though 
so long settled in the district — the only part of the Guinea 
coast west of the Gabun left in her possession — Portugal 
has done little towards its development. With a fertile and 
well- watered soil, exceedingly rich in natural products, there 
is not much commerce, and such trade as exists, chiefly in non- 
Portuguese hands, is hampered by excessive customs duties 
and vexatious regulations. In 1905 the external trade of the 
colony was not more than £160,000 and was less than it had 
been twenty years previously. Ground-nuts, rubber, wax and 
ivory are the principal exports. Revenue and expenditure are 
about £50,000 a year. Portuguese authority does not in fact 
extend much beyond the few stations maintained, nor has the 
local government won the confidence of the natives. In 1908 
Bissao and some European settlements on the mainland were 
besieged by the Papel and other tribes and troops had to be sent 
from Portugal before order could be restored. If however 
agriculture and commerce suffer, the ethnologist and zoologist 
find in this easily accessible little enclave a rich field for investi- 
gation, the almost nominal sovereignty of Portugal having 
left the country, practically uninfluenced by European culture, 
in much the same condition that it was in the 16th and 17th 
centuries.

PORTUNUS, or Portumnus, in Roman mythology, originally 
the god of gates and doors (Lat. porta), and as such identified 
with Janus and represented with a key in his hand. Gradually 
he came to be recognized as a separate deity, who protected 
the harbours {portus) and ensured a safe return to seafarers. 
(Cicero, Nat, deor. ii. 26; Virgil, Aen. v. 241). With the in- 
troduction of the Greek gods, he became merged in Palaemon- 
Melicertes. He had a special priest (flamen portunalis) and 
temples on the Tiber near the Aemilian bridge and near Ostia, 
where a festival was celebrated in his honour on the 17th of 
August. Mommsen unhesitatingly identifies Portunus with 
the river-god Tiberinus, from the fact that the festival is also 
called Tiberinalia in the fasti of Philocalus; Marquardt regards 
him rather as the tutelary deity of warehouses. 

See J. Marquardt, Romische Staatsverwaltung (1 885), iii. 327, 
note 10. 

PORTUS, an ancient harbour of Latium, Italy, on the right 
bank of the Tiber, at its mouth. For its origin see Ostia. 
Claudius constructed the first harbour here, 2 J m. north of Ostia, 
enclosing an area of 170 acres, with two long curving moles 
projecting into the sea, and an artificial island, bearing a light- 
house, in the centre of the space between them; the harbour thus 
opened directly to the sea on the north-west and communicated 
with the Tiber by a channel on the south-east. The object was to 
obtain protection from the prevalent south-west wind, to which 
the river mouth was exposed. Though Claudius, in the in- 
scription which he caused to be erected in a.d. 46, boasted 
that he had freed the city of Rome from the danger of inundation, 
his work was only partially successful. Nero gave the harbour 
the name of Portus Augusti. It was probably Claudius who 
constructed hither the direct road from Rome, the Via Portuensis 
(15 m.) which ran over the hills as far as the modern Ponte 
Galera, and then straight across the plain. An older road, the 
Via Campana, ran along the foot of the hills, following the right 
bank of the Tiber, and passing the grove of the Arval Brothers 
at the sixth mile, to the Campus saiinarum romanarum, the 
saltmarsh on the right bank — from which indeed it derived its 
name (see Notizie degli Scavi, 1888, p. 228). 

The site can still be fairly clearly traced in the low ground to the 
east of Fiumicino, and the lighthouse is represented in bas-reliefs. 
The harbour is generally supposed to have been protected by two 
moles with a breakwater in front, on which stood the lighthouse, 
with an entrance on each side of it. Trial soundings made in 1907 
showed that thecourse of the right-hand mole is represented by a 
low sandhill, while the central breakwater was only some 190 yds. 
long, and probably divided from each of the two moles by a channel 
some 125 yds. wide. The existence of two entrances is, indeed, 
in accordance with the evidence of coins and literary tradition, 
though the position of that on the left is not certain, and it may have 
been closed in later times. The whole course of the left-hand mole 
has not yet been traced, but it seems to have protected not only 
the south-west but a considerable portion of the north-west side 
of the harbour. In a.d. 103 Trajan constructed another harbour 
farther inland — a hexagonal basin enclosing an area of 97 acres, 
and communicating by canals with the harbour of Claudius, with 
the Tiber direct, and with the sea, the last now forming the navig- 
able arm of the Tiber (reopened for traffic by Gregory XIII. and 
again by Paul V.), and bearing the name Fossa trajana, though its 
origin is undoubtedly due to Claudius. The basin itself is still 
preserved, and is now a reedy lagoon. It was surrounded by exten- 
sive warehouses, remains of which may still be seen : the fineness of 
the brickwork of which they are built is remarkable. Farther to 
the cast is a circular building in brick with niches; it is called the 
temple of Portumnus. To the east again is the so-called Arco di 
Nostra Donna, a gateway (possibly originally built by Trajan) in 
the fortifications which surround the port and are attributed to the 
time of Constantine. Many other remains of buildings exist; they 
were more easily traceable in the 16th century when Pirro Ligorio 
and Antonio Labacco made 'plans of the harbour. Considerable 
excavations were carried on in 1868, but unfortunately with the 
idea of recovering works of art and antiquities; and the plan and 
description given by R. Lanciani (Annalidelinstituto, 1868, 144 sqq.) 
were made under unfavourable circumstances. By means of these 
works Portus captured the main share of the harbour traffic of Rome, 
and though the importance of Ostia did not at once decrease we 
find Portus already an episcopal see in Constantine 's time not very 



long (if at all) after Ostia, and as the only harbour in the time of the 
Gothic wars. 1 ts abandonment dates from the partial silting up of the 
right arm of the Tiber in the middle ages, which restored to Ostia what 
little traffic was left. To the west of the harbour is the cathedral of 
S. Rufina (10th century, but modernized except for the campanile) 
and the episcopal palace, fortified in the middle ages, and containing 
a number of ancient inscriptions from the site. On the island 
(Isola Sacra) just opposite is the church of S. Ippolito, built on the 
sjte of a Roman building, with a picturesque medieval campanile 
(13th century ?); 2 m. to the west is the modern village of Fiumicino 
at the mouth of the right arm of the Tiber, which is 21 m. west- 
south-west by rail from Rome. It is a frazione, or portion of the 
commune of Rome. Three miles to the north is the pumping 
station by which the lowland (formerly called Stagno di Maccarese, 
now reclaimed and traversed by many drainage canals) between here 
and Maccarese is kept drained (Bonifica di Maccarese) (see Tiber).

in importance of the French Mediterranean ports, and forms 
a good harbour of refuge. Its trade, which is with Spain, Greece 
and Algeria, is in cork, carobs, grain and wine, &c. 

PORUS (4th century B.C.), an Indian prince, ruler of the 
country between the rivers Hydaspes and Acesines at the time of 
the invasion of Alexander the Great. In the battle on the banks 
of the Hydaspes he offered a desperate resistance, and Alexander, 
struck by his independent spirit, allowed him to retain his 
kingdom, which he increased by the addition of territory. From 
this time Porus was a loyal supporter of Alexander. He still 
held the position of a Macedonian satrap when assassinated 
some time between 321 and 315 b.c.

PORZIO, CAMILLO (1526-1580?), Italian historian, belonged 
to a wealthy and noble Neapolitan family, and was the son of 
the philosopher, Simone Porzio. He studied law, first at Bologna 
and later at Pisa, and after graduating in utroque jure, practised 
as a lawyer in Naples. He died in 1580. His chief literary- 
work is La Congiura dei baroni, a history of the unsuccessful 
conspiracy of the Neapolitan barons against King Ferdinand I. 
of Naples in 1485; it is based on the authentic records of the 
state trials, but is prejudiced in favour of the royal power. It 
was first published by Manutius in Rome in 1565. Of Porzio's 
other works, the Sloria d'ltalia (from 1547 to 1552), of which 
only the first two books have survived, is the most important. 
The best edition of these two works is that edited "by C. Monzani 
(Florence, 1855). 

PORZIO, SIMONE (1497-1554), Italian philosopher, was 
born and died at Naples. Like his greater contemporary, 
Pomponazzi, he was a lecturer on medicine at Pisa (1546-1552), 
and in later life gave up purely scientific study for speculation 
on the nature of man. His philosophic theory was identical 
with that of Pomponazzi, whose De immortalitate animi he 
defended and amplified in a treatise De mente humane There 
is told of him a story which illustrates the temper of the early 
humanistic revival in Italy. When he was beginning his first 
lecture at Pisa he opened the meteorological treatises of Aris- 
totle. The audience, composed of students and townspeople, 
interrupted him with the cry Quid de anima ? (We would 
hear about the soul), and Porzio was constrained to change 
the subject of his lecture. He professed the most open 
materialism, denied immortality in all forms and taught that 
the soul of man is homogeneous with the soul of animals and 
plants, material in origin and incapable of separate existence. 

POSEIDON, in Greek mythology, god of the sea and of water 
generally, son of Cronus and Rhea, and brother of Zeus and 
Pluto. The connexion of his name with irbais, 7r6m>s, 7rorajuos, 
is generaUy accepted. When the three brothers deposed their 
father Cronus the kingdom of the sea fell by lot to Poseidon. 
His home was in a golden palace in the depths of the sea near 
Aegae in Achaea. In his hand he bore a trident, wherewith he 
lashed the sea into fury, split the rocks, and caused horses and 



170 



POSEN 



fountains to spring from them. But, while he caused storms 
and shipwrecks, he could also send favouring winds; hence he 
was known as Soter, " the preserver." Another of his titles was 
Gaecochos, " the supporter of earth/' the sea being supposed 
to support the earth and keep it firmly in its place. He was the 
god of navigation and his temples stood especially on headlands 
and isthmuses. Every occupation connected with the sea was 
under his protection, and seafaring people, especially the Ionians, 
regarded themselves as his descendants. As god of the sea he' 
disputed with other deities for the possession of the land. 
Earthquakes were thought to be produced by Poseidon shaking 
the earth — hence his epithet of Enosichthon, " Earth-shaker " — 
and hence he was worshipped even in inland places which had 
. suffered from earthquakes. The seismic wave was also his 
work; the destruction of Helice in Achaea by such a wave 
(373 B.C.) was attributed to his wrath (Strabo viii. 384). The 
island of Delos was thought to have been raised by him, and 
about 198, when a new island appeared between Thera and 
Therasia, the Rhodians founded a temple of Poseidon on it 
(Strabo i. 57). Thessaly was said to have been a lake until he 
opened a way for the waters through the Vale of Tempe (Hero- 
dotus vh\ 129). Poseidon was also the god of springs, which 
he produced by striking the rock with his trident, as he did on 
the acropolis of Athens when disputing with Athena for the 
sovereignty of Athens (Herodotus viii. 55; Apollodorus iii. 14). 
As such he was called Nymphagetes, the leader of the nymphs of 
springs and fountains, a god of fresh water, probably his original 
character, and in this connexion was <f>vTa\jjaos (phytalmius) , a 
god of vegetation, frequently associated with Demeter. In 
regard to the contest with Athena, it is probable that Poseidon 
is really Erechtheus, a local deity ousted by Athena and trans- 
formeoMnto an agricultural hero. Dr Farnell, however, holds that 
Erechtheus and Poseidon were originally independent figures, 
and that both Erechtheus and Athena were prior to Poseidon, 
As he gave, so he could withhold, springs of water; thus the 
waterless neighbourhood of Argos was supposed to be the result 
of his anger. Black bulls, symbolical of the stormy sea, were 
sacrificed to him, and often thrown alive into rivers; in Ionia 
and Thessaly bull-fights took place in his honour; at a festival 
of his at Ephesus the cupbearers were called " bulls/' and the 
god himself was surnamed " Bull Poseidon. " The horse was 
especially associated with his worship; he was said to have 
produced the first horse by striking the ground in Thessaly 
with his trident (Virgil, Georgics, i. 12). At the fountain of 
Dine in Argolis horses bitted and bridled were sacrificed to him 
by being drowned (Pausanias viii. 7, 2), and similarly Sextus 
Pompeius sought to propitiate him by throwing horses into the 
sea (Dio Cassius xlviii. 48). He bore the surname of " Horse 
Neptune " QlocreiJS&v tirmas), and was regarded as the tamer 
as well as the creator of the steed. In the deme of Colonus he 
was worshipped with Athena, the reputed inventor of the bridle. 
Various explanations of the title IWios have been given: (1) that 
the horse represented the corn-spirit; (2) the resemblance of 
the crested waves to horses; (3) the impression of horses' hoofs 
near the god's sacred springs, and the shaking of the earth by 
them when galloping (see Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, iv. 20). 
Poseidon plays a considerable part in Greek legend. In the 
Trojan War he takes the side of the Greeks, because he had been 
cheated of his reward by Laomedon, king of Troy, for whom he 
had built the walls of the city. The binding of his son Poly- 
phemus by Odysseus brings upon the hero the wrath of Poseidon, 
from which he is only protected by the united influence of the 
rest of the gods. He is famous for his numerous amours, 
especially with the nymphs of springs and fountains; his offspring 
were mostly wild and cruel, like the sea — the Laestrygones, 
Polyphemus, Antaeus, Procrustes and the like. He was wor- 
shipped as a national god by the Ionians, who took his worship 
over with them from Peloponnesus to Asia Minor. His chief 
sanctuary was at Mycale, where the Panionia, the national 
festival of the Ionians, was held. Other seats of his worship 
were in Thessaly, Boeotia and Peloponnesus. At Taenarum 
in Laconia he had a famous cave-like temple, with an asylum, 



and on the island of Tenos he was worshipped as the physician, 
probably in reference to the health-giving properties of the sea 
air. By far the most famous of his festivals was that celebrated 
every alternate year on the isthmus of Corinth, at which the 
" Isthmian games " were held. Here a colossal statue of him 
was set up in bronze by the Greeks after their victory over the 
Persians* The horse, the dolphin (the symbol of the calm sea) 
and the pine-tree, with wreaths of which the Isthmian victors 
were crowned, were sacred to him. Horses and black bulls, 
boars and rams were offered to him, sometimes human beings. 
His attributes are the trident and the dolphin (sometimes the 
tunny fish.) 

As represented in art Poseidon resembles Zeus, but possesses less 
of his majestic calm, his muscles are more emphasized, and his hair 
is thicker and somewhat dishevelled. He is generally naked; his 
right leg rests on a rock or the prow of a ship ; he carries a trident 
in hishand, and is gazing in front of him, apparently out to sea; 
sometimes fie is .standing on the water, swinging his trident, or riding 
in his chariot over the waves, accompanied by his wife Amphitrite, 
the Nereids and other inhabitants of the sea. It is in keeping with 
his restless character that he is rarely found sitting. He sometimes 
wears a long robe, sometimes a light scarf. Scopas, in a famous 
group, represented him surrounded by the denizens of the sea, escort- 
ing Achilles to the islands of the blest. In modern Greece St Nicholas 
has taken the place of Poseidon as patron of sailors. But the 
Zacynthians have a special seagod^ half man, half fish, who dwells 
under the sea, rides on dolphins or in a car drawn by dolphins, and 
wields a trident. By the Romans Poseidon was identified with 
Neptune (q.v.).

the German Empire, bounded N. by the Prussian province of 
West Prussia, E. by Russian Poland and S. and W. respectively 
by the Prussian provinces of Silesia and Brandenburg. Its 
area is 11,186 sq. m. and the population shows a density of 
177*5 inhabitants to the square mile. Posen belongs to the 
north German plain, and consists of a low plateau intersected by 
the beds of the Netze, the Warthe and the Obra. These three 
rivers drain into the Oder, but part of the province falls within 
the basin of the Vistula, which forms the frontier for a short 
distance on the north-east. By means of the Bromberger canal 
the Netze is joined with the Brake and then through this river 
with the Vistula. The surface is dotted with small lakes and 
ponds, and there are many broad fens and marshes. The soil is 
light and sandy, but much of the land reclaimed in the boggy 
districts is very fertile. Upwards of 61% of the area is under 
tillage, 13% is occupied by pasture and meadows and 20% by 
forests, mostly fir. The principal crops are rye, the chief cereal 
grown, wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, beets and hops. The vine 
is cultivated to some extent in the south-west corner, and tobacco 
is also grown. The marshy tracts often afford excellent pasture 
and support large numbers of cattle, sheep and goats. The 
mineral resources of the province are practically restricted to 
lignite and salt. Besides brewing and distilling, the chief pro- 
ducts are machinery, sugar, cloth, tobacco and bricks. Trade 
in timber and agricultural produce is facilitated by the network 
of railways, navigable rivers and canals, but both industry and 
trade are somewhat cramped by the duties imposed at the 
Russian frontier. The population of the province in 1905 was 
1,986,637, including 1,347,958 Roman Catholics, 605,312 
Protestants and 30,433 Jews. The Roman Catholics are mainly 
Poles, of whom there are upwards of 1,000,000 in Posen, while 
the great bulk of the 900,000 Germans are Protestants. About 
57% of the population was returned in 1905 as "rural/* in 
spite of the large number of so-called " towns," only five of 
which, however, have more than 20,000 inhabitants — Posen, 
Bromberg, Hohensalza, Gnesen and Scbneidemiihl. The pro- 
vince of Posen was long the worst-educated part of the German 
dominions, but of recent years this blemish has been removed. 
Thus while in 1882-1883 the ratio of illiterate recruits 
amounted to 9*75%, in 1901 less than one quarter per cent of

the military drafts were without schooling. The province returns 
15 members to the Reichstag, 29 to the Prussian Lower House 
of the Prussian Diet, and is represented in the Upper House by 
19 members. It is divided into two districts, those of Bromberg 
and Poscn. 

History. — The history of Posen, comprehending some part of 
the old kingdom of Poland, including its most ancient capital, 
Gnesen, falls within the scope of the article Poland. Its political 
connexion with Prussia began in 1772, when the districts to the north 
of the Netze fell to the share of that power in the first partition of 
Poland. The rest followed in 1793. and was united with the Netze 
district to form the province of South Prussia. In 1807, after the 
peace of Tilsit, Posen was incorporated with the grand duchy of 
Warsaw, but in 1815 it reverted to Prussia under the style of the 
grand duchy of Posen. In 1848 the Polish inhabitants of the 
province revolted and had to be put down by force, and, in spite of 
the efforts of the Prussian government, they remain in language and 
culture separated from their German compatriots. 

The tide of German immigration into Posen began at an early 
period and flowed strongly in the 13th and following centuries. 
The industrious German settlers were welcomed by the Polish 
nobles and were the founders of most of the towns, in which they 
lived after their own customs and were governed bv their own laws. 
They established manufactures, introduced the cultivation of hops, 
reclaimed the waste soil, and did much to improve agriculture. 
In the 16th century Protestantism was widely diffused by their 
means. A strong reaction set in in the_ following century, and per- 
secution of the Protestants went hand in hand with the ravages^ of 
war in hastening the political, intellectual and agricultural decline 
of the district. By the 18th century the burghers had sunk to the 
level of " stadtische Bauern," or peasants with municipal privileges, 
and poverty and misery were widely spread. 

In the latter part of the 19th century, however, this state of things 
began to be greatly modified owing to the strong Polish national move- 
ment which threatened to drive back the boundaries of Germanism 
in the eastern provinces of Prussia, as they had already been driven 
back in Bohemia. Hitherto the most important class in Posen had 
been the Polish nobles, of whom many were very poor; but the 
economic development of the country and the break-up of the large 
estates into peasant holdings, which created a comparatively wealthy 
Polish middle class, threatened German ascendancy more seriously 
than had the traditional nationalism of the nobles. To combat this 
the Prussian government entered on a policy of the compulsory 
Germanization of the Polish population. In 1872 an administrative 
ordinance made German the medium of instruction in the schools 
" wherever possible," and the police commissaries who attended 
public meetings were instructed to elose^ any meeting at which 
speeches were delivered in Polish. In April 1888 the Prussian par- 
liament passed a law establishing a commission for the purpose of 
buying the land of the Poles in Posen and West Prussia, and letting 
it out to German colonists. The sum of 100,000,000 marks 
(£5,000,000) was voted for this work, to which in 1898 a like sum was 
added. In fifteen years an area of nearly 600 sq. m. of land was 
bought from the Poles, over one-half in Posen, and on this over 4000 
families were settled. In spite of this policy, however, the Polish 
element continued to gain, this being partly due to immigration over 
the eastern border, partly to the repressive policy of the Prussian 
government, which converted what had been an aristocratic opposi- 
tion into one that is popular and radical. In 1902 much scandal 
was caused by the revelation made in the Prussian parliament of 
the methods used in the attempt to Germanize the Poles; and Count 
Biilow had to confess that "corporal punishment was out of place 
in religious instruction " ; Polish children having been beaten for 
refusing to say the Lord's Prayer in German (see Ann. Reg., 1901, 
p. 278). In his speech of the 13th of January 1903, in which he made 
the above admission, Count Bulow also had to admit the failure of 
the Prussian policy. Fresh legislation was passed in May, devoting 
another 250,000,000 marks (£12,500,000) to the polity of German 
colonization, and forbidding the German colonists to sell their land 
to Poles. 1 The laws forbidding the use of the Polish language in 
the schools were retained, in spite of an agitation in Germany itself 
for their repeal. t Yet, three years later, Baron von Rheinbaben, 
the Prussian minister of finance, complained that in fifteen years the 
German population of East Prussia had diminished by 630,000, 
while Polish immigrants had in five years numbered 300,000; at the 
same time he confessed that the Poles were vastly increasing their 
economic resources at the expense of the German element. As 
a result of this report a further sum of £100,000 was voted for 
" provincial colonization " and to prevent German emigration. 

In 1906 the Prussian government was made somewhat ridiculous 
by the strike of some 100,000 Polish school children, who objected 
to being whipped for refusing to answer questions in German. The 
petition of the archbishop of Posen that the children should be 
allowed to receive religious instruction in Polish having been re- 
jected by the Prussian minister of education, he issued on the 17th 
of October a pastoral allowing parents to confine religious instruction 

1 Annual Register (1902), p. 280 seq. 



to home or priestly teaching. _ As a result parents were fined or 
imprisoned for withdrawing their children from religious instruction. 
The repressive efforts of the government, however, culminated 
in the bill, introduced in the session of 1907 by Prince Billow, pro- 
viding for the compulsory expropriation of Polish landowners in 
favour of Germans. This bill, which applied to 4< the districts in 
which the safety of the endangered German element could only be 
ensured by additional allotments to German settlers " — i.e. Posen 
and West Prussia — was passed, in spite of the strenuous opposition 
of some of the most conspicuous nobles in Prussia, in the session of 
1908. At the same time under the Public Meetings Bill, introduced 
in 1907 and now passed, no language save German was to be used at 
any public meetings other than international congresses, &c. — save 
during actual parliamentary elections (Ann. Reg., 1908, p. 29X)). 
How opposed to the general sentiment of Germany the Prussian 
policy in Posen was, was shown in February 1909, when it was 
condemned, though without effect, by a resolution of the German 
imperial parliament. In January 1910 the Prussian policy was 
again arraigned in the German parliament in connexion with the 
" Kattowitz incident," Herr von Delbriick justifying the removal 
of a number of minor officials, for voting for Polish candidates at 
a municipal election, on the ground that the officials of the empire 
deserted the ground on which the constitution of the empire rested 
if they failed to support Prussia in her struggle (The Times* 
January 13, 1910, 5 d.). Herr von Bethmann Hollweg expressed 
himself later in the Prussian parliament to the same effect (ibid. 
January 20 and 22).

POSEN (Polish Poznan), a city, archiepiscopal see and fortress 
of Germany, capital of the province of Posen, situated in a wide 
and sandy plain at the confluence of the Cybina and the Warthe, 
150 m. E. from Berlin and 103 m. from Breslau. Pop. (1885), 
68,315; (1895), 73,239; (1905), 136,808, of whom nearly one-half 
are Germans and about one-tenth Jews. Posen lies at the 
centre of a network of railways connecting it with Berlin, Breslau, 
Thorn, Kreuzburg, and Schneidemuhl. The inner line of fortifi- 
cations was removed in 1902 and the city has been completely 
modernized. The principal part of Posen, on the left bank of 
the Warthe, comprises the old town (Alstadt) and the modern 
quarter created by the Prussians after 1793. On the right bank 
lie Wallischei (a district inhabited by Poles) and some other 
suburbs. Posen has fifteen Roman Catholic and three Evangelical 
churches and several synagogues. The cathedral contains 
many interesting objects of art, but, with the exception of the 
Gothic Marienkirche of the 15th century, none of the churches 
is notable. The old town-hall is a quaint Slavonic adaptation 
of Romanesque forms. The royal castle, begun in 1905 and 
completed in 1910 at a cost of £250,000, is a pretentious build- 
ing in what is officially called Romanesque style. It was 
intended as an effort to conciliate the Poles, and was opened 
by the emperor William II., with imposing ceremonies, on the 
20th of August 1 910. Posen possesses an " Emperor William " 
library with 200,000 volumes, and the Raczynski library with 
50,000. Other principal buildings are the two theatres, the 
Emperor Frederick museum, founded in 1894, the Polish museum 
and the various public offices. Industries include the manu- 
facture of agricultural machinery, spirits, furniture and sugar, 
also milling and brewing. There is an active trade, both 
by rail and river, in corn, cattle, wood, wool and potatoes. 
Posen is the headquarters of the V. army corps, and has a 
garrison of 6000 men.

became the seat of a Christian bishopric about the middle of the 
10th century. The original settlement was on the right bank 
of the Warthe, but the new town, established on the opposite 
bank by German settlers about 1250, soon became the more 
important part of the double city. Posen became a great dep6t 
for the trade between Germany and western Europe on the one 
hand and Poland and Russia on the other. Many foreign 
merchants made the city their residence, and these included a 
colony of Scots, who exported produce to Edinburgh. The 
city attained the climax of its prosperity in the 16th century, 
when its population, according to one estimate, reached 80,000. 
The intolerance shown to the Protestants, the troubles of the 
Thirty Years' War, the plague and other causes, soon conspired 
to change this state of affairs, and in the 18th century the 
population sank to 12,000. New life was infused into the city, 
after its annexation by Prussia at the second partition of Poland 
in 1793, and since this date its growth has been rapid.

POSIDIPPUS (3rd cent. B.C.), Greek dramatist, of Cassandrea 
in Macedonia, the last and one of the most distinguished of the 
writers of the new comedy. He began to write for the stage 
in 289 B.C., and, according to Suidas, wrote 40 plays, of which 
17 titles and some fragments have been preserved. He appears 
to have gone somewhat out of the beaten track in his choice of 
subjects, and it is evident that cooks held an important position 
in his list of characters. His comedies were frequently imitated 
by the Romans (Aulus Gellius ii. 23), and it is considered very 
probable that the Menaechmi (a comedy of errors) of Plautus is 
an adaptation either from the "O/xoiot, or from some unknown 
comedy of Posidippus, called At5u/xot, or perhaps Mkvatxpoi. 
His statue in the Vatican is considered a masterpiece of ancient 
art.

1 Posidippus is also the name of a writer of epigrams (c. 270 B.C.), 
of which about 30 are preserved in the Greek Anthology.

POSIDONIUS (c. 130-50 B.C.), nicknamed " the Athlete," 
Stoic philosopher, the most learned man of his time (so Strabo 
t&v Kad' fjfi as <j>tkoa6(f>o3V irokvfiadeaTaToSj Galen kirwnjfxoviKayraTos) 
and perhaps of all the school. A native of Apamea in Syria and 
a pupil of Panaetius, he spent after his teacher's death many 
years in travel and scientific researches in Spain (particularly 
at Gades), Africa, Italy, Gaul, Liguria, Sicily and on the eastern 
shores of the Adriatic. When he settled as a teacher at Rhodes 
(hence his surname " the Rhodian ") his fame attracted numer- 
ous scholars; next to Panaetius he did most, by writings and 
personal intercourse, to spread Stoicism in the Roman world, 
and he became well known to many leading men, such as Marius, 
Rutilius Rufus, Pompey and Cicero. The last-named studied 
under him (78-77 B.C.), and speaks as his admirer and friend. 
He visited Rome, e.g. on an embassy in 86 B.C., but probably 
did not settle there as a teacher. 

His works, now lost, were written in an attractive style and proved 
a mine of information to later writers. The titles and subjects of 
more than twenty of them are known. In common with other 
Stoics of the middle period, he displayed eclectic tendencies, follow- 
ing the older Stoics, Panaetius, Plato and Aristotle. His admiration 
for Plato led him to write a commentary on the Timaeus; in another 
way it is shown by important modifications which he made in 
psychological doctrine. Unquestionably more of a polymath than a 
philosopher, he appears uncritical and superficial. But at the time 
his spirit of inquiry provoked Strabo's criticism as something alien 
to the school (rd ainoXoyiicSv ical t6 dptarortAtfoj', 5ircp htatklvovaw ol 
iiixtTepoi). In natural science, geography, natural history, mathematics 
and astronomy he took a genuine interest. He sought to determine 
the distance and magnitude of the sun, to calculate the diameter of 
the earth and the influence of the moon on the tides. His history 
of the period from 146 to 88 B.C., in fifty-two books, must have been 
a valuable storehouse of facts. Cicero, who submitted to his criti- 
cism the memoirs which he had written in Greek of his consulship, 



made use of writings of Posidonius in De natura deorum, bk. ii., and 
De divinatione, bk. i., and the author of the pseudo-Aristotelian 
treatise De mundo also borrowed from him.

POSITIVE (or Portable) ORGAN, a medieval chamber organ 
which could be carried from place to place without being taken 
to pieces, and when played was placed on a table or stool and 
required a blower for the bellows, as well as a performer. It was 
larger and more cumbersome than the portative {q.v.), with 
which it has often been confounded. The positive had usually 
but one kind of pipe, the open diapason of 2 ft. tone, and in the 
1 6th century the best types had three registers by means of 
which each note could be sounded^with its fifth and octave, or 
each by itself, or again in combinations of twos. The positive 
differed from the regal in having flue pipes, whereas the latter 
had beating reeds in tiny pipes, one or two inches long, concealed 
behind the keyboard. During the early middle ages most of the 
pneumatic organs belonged to this type. 

A well-known instance of an early positive or portable organ of 
the 4th v century occurs on the obelisk erected to the memory of 
Theodosius the Great, on his death in a.d. 395. Among the illumi- 
nated manuscripts of the British Museum miniatures abound repre- 
senting interesting varieties of the portable organ of the middle ages; 
such as Add. MS. 29902 (fol. 6) and Add. MS. 27695b (lol. 13), Cotton 
MS. Tiberius A VII. fol. I04d., all of the 14th century, Add. MS. 
28962, Add. MS. 17280, both of the 15th century. These little 
organs were to be found at every kind of function, civil and religious; 
they were used in the dwellings and chapels of the rich; at banquets 
and court functions; in choirs and music schools; and in the small 
orchestras of Peri and Monteverdi at the dawn of the musical 
drama or opera. (K. S.) 

POSITIVISM (derived from ponere 7 whence positus, that 
which is laid down, certain), a philosophical term, applied some- 
what loosely to any system which confines itself to the data of 
experience and declines to recognize a priori or metaphysical 
speculations. In this sense the term may be applied to empirical 
philosophers in general. Thus Hume is a positivist in the sense 
that he specifically restricts philosophy to the sphere of observa- 
tion, and regards the causal relation as being nothing more 
than what we have been accustomed to expect. Similarly Mill, 
Spencer and physical scientists generally view the universe 
from the positivist standpoint. _ In its commonest acceptation, 
however, positivism is both narrower and wider than this. The 
term is specifically used of the philosophy of Auguste Comte, 
who applied the term to his system according to which knowledge 
is based exclusively on the methods and discoveries of the 
physical 'or " positive " sciences. According to Comte human 
thought passes through three stages — theological, metaphysical 
and positive. The final stage, positivism, is the understanding 
of the universe not as composed of a multitude of individuals 
each with volition, but as an ordered organism governed by 
necessary laws (see further Comte). The outcome of this 
positivism is the substitution for revealed religion of a religion 
of humanity — according to Huxley " Catholicism minus 
Christianity" — in which God is replaced by Humanity. This 
religion was to have its special priesthood, ritual and organiza- 
tion. 

Positivism has, therefore, two distinct sides, the philosophical and 
the religious or mystical. Philosophical positivism has had dis- 
tinguished representatives in France, Germany and England, and 
in the wider sense indicated above may be regarded as one of the 
two or three chief influences on modern philosophical development. 
Though the details of Comte's philosophic structure, e.g. the classi- 
fication of the sciences, are without important significance, the posi- 
tivistic tendency is prominent in all systems of thought which deny 
the supernatural and the metaphysical. Agnosticism, Phenomenal- 
ism, Rationalism, Materialism 'all manifest the positivist spirit, 
denying what may be succinctly described as the metempirical. 



POSSE COMITATUS— POSSESSION 



173 



In France the Comtian tradition was maintained with important 
reservations and the abandonment of the religious aspect by Littre 
(q.v.), Taine and others. In Germany many ofthe followers of Kant 
have in greater or less degree maintained the^ view that all true 
knowledge depends upon the observation of objective phenomena. 
The distinctly religious aspect has been comparatively unimportant, 
except in so far as modern social evolutionist ethics may be regarded 
as religious in character. In England, however, a number of pro- 
minent Positivists have carried out Comte's original ideal of a Church 
of Humanity with ritual and organization. The chief building (in 
Chapel Street, Lamb's Conduit Street, London) is adorned with 
busts of the saints of humanity, and regular services are held. 
Positivist hymns are sung and addresses delivered. Among the 
leaders of this movement have been Frederic Harrison, Richard 
Congreve, E. S. Beesly and J. H. Bridges (d. 1906). Services are 
also held weekly in Essex Hall, London, and there are a few other 
centres in the provinces, including a prosperous church in Liverpool. 

POSSE COMITATUS (Lat. " power of a county "), a summons 
to every male in the county, between the ages of fifteen and 
twenty, to be ready and apparelled, at the command of the 
sheriff and the cry of the county, to maintain peace and pursue 
felons. Ecclesiastical persons, peers and such as laboured under 
any infirmity were not compellable to attend. Owing to the 
establishment of county police, the sheriff does not now pursue 
felons, but by the Sheriffs Act (18S7, sec. 8, sub-sec. 2) the calling 
out of the posse comitatus is expressly authorized if the sheriff 
finds any resistance in the execution of a writ. In view of the 
sheriff's duty to raise, if necessary, the posse comitatus it is no 
answer by him, for non-execution of a writ, to say that he was 
resisted. 

See P. E. Mather, Sheriff Law. 

POSSESSION (Lat. possessio, possidere, to possess), in law, a 
term derived from Roman law. The Roman conception of 
possession has been generally adopted, but not the Roman deduc- 
tions from the conception. The subject of possession has become 
more difficult owing to the various senses in which the term has 
been interpreted. Thus it has been said to be. either a right or a 
fact conferring a right, or both together. The latter is the view 
of Savigny, the leading authority upon the subject (Recht des 
Besitzes, translated by Sir Erskine Perry, 1848). Further, there 
is a want of agreement among legal writers as to the amount 
of right or rights that it confers. All that can be said with 
safety is that possession stands in a position intermediate 
between simple detention and absolute ownership, and that it 
implies two elements, physical detention and mental intention 
to hold the thing possessed as one's own. These difficulties 
being borne in mind, the definition of \V. A. Hunter may be 
accepted: " Possession is the occupation of anything with the 
intention of exercising the rights of ownership in respect of it " 
(Roman Law, p. 209). Possession is inchoate or incomplete 
ownership; it is on its way to become ownership. In the case 
of the public domain of Rome (ager publicus) the possession was 
really the important matter, the dominium being practically of 
no value. Possession in Roman law was either natural or civil. 
The former was mere occupation, the latter such occupation as 
ripened by prescription into ownership. Possession exclusive 
against the world (including the true owner) was called " adverse 
possession." A servitude, such as a right of way, could not be 
held in true possession, but was said to be in " quasi-possession." 
The quasi-possessor, however, had possessory remedies. In 
Roman law a broad distinction was drawn between possession 
and ownership (dominium). 1 They were protected by different 
remedies — possession by interdict, ownership by action. This 
difference can only be explained by history. Here again, 
unfortunately, authorities differ. According to Savigny, a 
Roman citizen who had become a tenant of part of the ager 
publicus could not by any length of holding obtain more than a 
quasi-ownership, but one of which it would have been morally 
unjust to have deprived him, " The only legal remedies of 
which the tenants could avail themselves, if ejected or threatened 
with disturbance, were the possessory interdicts, summary 
processes of Roman law which were either expressly devised by 

1 The distinction is very important, as it affects the contract of 
sale. The contract was not to transfer ownership, as in English 
law, but only vacua possessio. 



the praetor for their protection, or else, according to another 
theory, had in older times been employed for the provisional 
maintenance of possessions pending the settlement of questions 
of legal right " (Maine, Ancient Law, ch. viii.). Savigny regards 
the protection of possession as an extension of the protection 
of the person. The same view was taken by the English court 
of exchequer in Rogers v. S pence, 13 M. & W. R. p. 581. 
According to Hunter (Roman Law, pp. 206, 221), Savigny 
overlooked the needs of aliens. It was the needs of aliens, 
incapable of the full proprietary rights of Roman citizens, 
that led to the invention by the praetor of a means of giving 
them equitable rights in the land, and protecting them in 
the enjoyment of these rights. Savigny attributes only two 
rights to possession in Roman law — acquisition of ownership 
by possession for a given time (usucapio, longi temporis possessio) 
and protection of possession from disturbance (interdictum). 
Others have included further rights — inter alia, the right to use 
force in defence of possession, and the right to have the burden 
of proof, in a contest as to the title, thrown upon the adversary: 
" In pari causa possessor potior haberi debet." The position 
of the possessor in Roman law was very strong. If a bona fide 
possessor, he could bring an action for furtum even against the 
owner, if a mala fide possessor of land, he was so far protected 
that he could not be ejected by force. A mala fide possessor of 
movables could, however, acquire no rights. 2 

It has been already stated that there is both a physical 
and a mental element in the conception of possession. This 
docs not necessarily mean that corporal contact is in all cases 
requisite, or that the intention to hold the thing possessed as 
one's own may not be abandoned for a time. The control may 
be potential as well as actual. An estate may be possessed 
without the possessor going upon the land at all, and the 
possession of goods may be given by delivering the key of the 
warehouse in which they are stored. In international law 
the possession of part as giving a title to the whole has been of 
great importance (see International Law). Where goods are 
pledged or bailed for a specific purpose the intention of the 
pledgor or bailor to hold them as his own is suspended during the 
existence of the limited right of the pledgee or bailee, to whom 
a fragment of the possession has passed. In Roman law the 
pledgor had possessio ad usucapionem, the pledgee possessio ad 
interdicta. The possession of the pledgee or bailee has been 
called " derivative possession." Possession may be exercised 
through another (" animo nostro, corpore alieno "), as through a 
servant, who has not true possession. 5 Possession so exercised 
has been called " representative possession." As soon as the 
representative determines to assume control on his own behalf 
or to submit to the control of another, the possession of the 
principal is gone. Possession may be transferred or lost. It is 
lost when either the corpus or the animus (to use the terms of 
Roman law) ceases to exist. It may be lost by the representa- 
tives in cases where the principal might have lost it. 

In both Roman and English law the possessory tended to 
supersede the proprietary remedies from their greater con- 
venience^ — that is to say, the plaintiff based his claim or the 
defendant his right upon possession rather than property. The 
English possessory action may have been directly suggested 
by the interdict. Bracton (103b) identifies the assise of novel 
disseisin, the most common form of possessory action, with the 
interdict unde vi. In England ejectment had practically 
superseded other real actions before the latter were (with the 
exception of dower, writ of dower and quare impedit) expressly 
abolished by the Real Property Limitation Act 1833, s. 36. 
The action for the recovery of land, introduced by the Judicature 
Acts, is the modern representative of the action of ejectment. 

s This does not agree with English law, where in certain cases a 
thief can give a good title to stolen goods, though he has no title 
himself. 

* Much of the law of master and servant is based upon the Roman 
law of master and slave. The servant, like the slave, has not posses- 
sion of his master's goods even though they are in his custody, unless, 
indeed, the circumstances are such that he ceases to be a servant 
and becomes a bailee.

POSSESSION 



The right of a party to recover possession is enforced by a writ 
of possession. 

Possession gives in English law, speaking generally, much the 
same rights as in Roman law. Thus it serves to found a title 
(see Limitation, Statutes of; Prescription), and to throw the 
onus of proof upon the claimant. In an action for the recovery 
of land the defendant need only allege that he is in possession 
by himself or by his tenant, and (where such an allegation is 
necessary) that he had no notice to quit. The chief differences 
between Roman and English law, arising to some extent from 
the differences in the history of the two systems, are that the 
former did not give to derivative possessors (except in the case 
of pledge) the remedies of possessors, as does English law, 
and that Roman law is stricter than English in requiring that 
possession to found usucapio should (except in the case of 
jus aquae ducendae ) be exjusto titulo, or under colour of right 
(see Prescription). There is one case of constructive 
possession which is peculiar to English law — that is, where 
possession is said to be given by a deed operating under the 
Statute of Uses (see " Orme's Case," L. R. 8, C. P. p. 281). 

In English law the doctrine of possession becomes practically 
important in the following cases. (1) Possession serves as a con- 
venient means of division of estates (see Real Property). One of 
the divisions of estates is into estates in possession and estates in 
reversion or remainder. It also serves^ as a division of personal 
property (q.v.). A close in action is said to be reduced into pos- 
session when the right of recovery^ by legal proceedings has become 
a right of enjoyment. (2) Possession gives a title against a wrong- 
doer. In the case of real property it is regarded as prima facie 
evidence of seisin. 1 In the case of personal property the mere 
possession of a finder is sufficient to enable him to maintain an 
action of trover against one who deprives him of the chattel 1 (see 
the leading case of Armory v. Delamirie, 1 Str. 504). (3) What 
is called unity^ of possession " is one of the means whereby an 
easement is extinguished. Thus the owner of close A may have 
had a right of way over close B, while the latter belonged to a 
different owner. If the two closes come to be owned by the same 
person, the right of way is extinguished, but may under^ certain 
circumstances revive on the separation of the ownership. (4) 
Possession is very important as an element in determining the 
title to goods under 13 Eliz. c. 5, the Bills of Sale Act 1878 and 
the Bankruptcy Acts 1883 to 1890. It may be said that as a 
general rule retention of possession by the transferor or an absolute 
assignment or a colourable delivery of possession to the transferee 
is strong prima facie evidence of fraud. (5) Possession of goods 
or documents of title to goods is generally sufficient to enable 
agents and others to give a good title under the Factors* Acts 
(see Factor). (6) In criminal Jaw the question of possession is 
important in founding the distinction between larceny and embezzle- 
ment. If the goods are in the possession of the master and he 
gives them to the custody of his servant for a specific purpose and 
the servant stealsthem.it is larceny; if they have never come into 
the master's possession, as if a clerk receives money on his masters 
behalf, it is embezzlement. Recent possession of stolen goods is 
always regarded as a presumption that the person in whose pos- 
session they are stole them or received them knowing them to 
have been stolen. In the case of a charge of receiving stolen goods 
evidence may be given that there was found in the possession of 
the accused other property stolen within the preceding period of 
twelve months, 34 & 35 Vict. c. 112, s. 19. (For possession in 
criminal law, see Stephen, Digest of the Criminal Law, note xi.) 
(7) Actions of possession of ships fall within the jurisdiction of the 
admiralty division. This jurisdiction in the case of British vessels 
depends upon the Admiralty Court Act 1861 (24 Vict, c.io, s. 8), 
in the case of foreign vessels (in which the jurisdiction is rarely exer- 
cised) upon the general powers of the court as a maritime court. 

The doctrines of adverse possession (in the old English sense, 
which was not identical with the Roman law, for the real owner must 
have actually or by fiction been disseised) and of possessio fratris 
are now of only antiquarian interest. The Statutes of Limitation 
have superseded the first. The only question now is, not whether 
possession has been adverse or not, but whether twelve years have 
elapsed since the right accrued. The maxim " possessio fratris 
de feodo simplici sororem facit esse haeredem " (Coke upon Littleton, 



1 " Seisin " and " possession " are used sometimes as synonyms, 
as generally by Bracton; at other times they are distinguished : thus 
there can be possession of a term of years, but no seisin (Noy, Maxims, 
p. 2). It seems doifbtful, however, how far in English law a tenant 
for years has true possession, for he is in law only a bailiff or servant 
of the landlord. But he certainly has possessory remedies, like the 
quasi-possessor in Roman law.

possession vaut titre." 



14b) has been altered by the rule of descent introduced by the 
Inheritance Act 1833, under which descent is traced from the 
purchaser. At one time possessory suits were occasionally main- 
tained in England, and more frequently in Ireland, for the quieting 
of possession after proof of three years' possession before the filing 
of the bill. But such suits are now obsolete (see Neilt v. Duke of 
Devonshire, 8 A. C. 146). There was one characteristic case in old 
English law in which possession was maintained by means of what 
was called " continual claim,'* made yearly in due form, where the 
person , having the right was prevented by force or fear from 
exercising it (Coke upon Littleton, 253b). Continual claim was 
abolished by the Real Property Limitation Act 1833, s. 11. 

Scotland. — In Scotland possessory actions still exist eo nomine. 
Actions of molestation, of removing, and of maills (payments) and 
duties are examples. A possessory judgment is one which entitles 
a person who has been in possession under a written title for seven 

J ears to continue his possession (Watson, Law Diet., s.v. " Possessory 
udgment "). 
United States. — Here the law in general agrees with that of 
England. Possessory rights are taxed in some of the states. 
Louisiana follows Roman law closely. Possession of incorporeal 
rights (to use the unscientific language of the Code) is called quasi- 
possession, and the division of possession into natural and civil is 
maintained (Civil Code, ss. 3389-3^.19). 

In addition to the authorities cited may be mentioned Smith, 
Diet, of Antiquities, s.v. " Possessio"; Markby, Elements of Law; 
Holland, Elements of Jurisprudence; Holmes, The Common Law 
(Iect. vi.) ; Pollock and Wright, Possession in the Common Law. 

a. wo 

POSSESSION, the term given to the supposed control of a 
human body and mind by an alien spirit, human or non-human; 
or the occupation by an alien spirit of some portion of a human 
body, causing sickness, pain, &c. The term obsession (Lat. for 
siege) is sometimes used as equivalent to possession; some- 
times it denotes spirit 'control exercised from without, or it may 
mean no more than a maniacal monoideism. From an anthro- 
pological point of view possession may be conveniently classed 
as (a) inspirational, (b) demoniacal, (c) pathological, according 
to the view taken of the reason for or effect of the spiritual 
invasion of the possessed person. 

a. In inspirational possession the oracle spirit is held to have 
entered the person in order to foretell the future or to proclaim 
the will of a god; the god himself may be regarded as speaking 
through the mouth of his devotee; among peoples in the lower 
stages of culture possession by spirits of the dead is inspirational, 
especially where there is any kind of ancestor worship in vogue. 
This kind of possession, so far as is known, does not appear among 
some of the lowest peoples, e.g. the Australians; but it is common 
in Africa, Polynesia and Asia, where European influence has not 
led to its decay. Mai\y of the classical oracles were regarded as 
due to divine inspiration. The manifestations are often yoluntarily 
induced and^ are provoked in many different ways; in classical 
times the eating of laurel leaves, the inhaling of fumes which ascended 
from a cleft in the rocks of Delphi, the drinking of intoxicating 
liquors, or of a more widely found means of inducing the phenomena 
— blood — were all in use. In the Malay Peninsula the medicine- 
man inhales incense which rises in clouefs from a censer and hangs 
like a mist round his headf similar hypnotic effects are produced 
in Egypt in the case of divining boys by means of dru^s. In Fiji 
the priest sat before a dish of scented oil and anointed himself with 
it, till in a few minutes he began to tremble and was finally strongly 
convulsed. In parts of India, draughts of blood from the neck 
of the newly decapitated victim were the means of rousing the 
priest to frenzy; while in Siberia, America and many parts of Africa 
drumming, contortions and orgiastic dancing are more commonly 
found. According to another account K the Fijian priest provoked 
the onset of the trance by a method in use in ordinary hypnotic 
practice; he sat amid dead silence before a whale's tooth, at which 
he gazed steadfastly. 

The symptons of supposed possession by a god differ as widely 
as do those of the hypnotic trance. In Hawaii the god Oro gave 
his oracles by inspiring the priest, who ceased to speak or act as 
a voluntary agent, his frenzied utterances being interpreted by the 
attendant priests. In the Malay Peninsula the pawang, after 
censing himself, lies down on his back, with his head shrouded, 
and awaits the moment of inspiration. The tiger spirit which is 
trie familiar of all Malay pawangs manifests its presence by a low 
lifelike growl and the pawang scratches at the mat, gives a series 
of catlike leaps and licks up from the floor the handfuls of rice 
scattered there. But his state seems to be far removed from the 
ecstasy of the Hawaiian priest, though it must be remembered that 
no test of bona fides is possible in either case. We meet with 
another stage in Tahiti in the lofty declamation of the possessed 
priests, who thus afford a parallel to the utterances of many modern 
mediums. Finally in Africa, where the frenzied form of possession 
is also common, we find at Sofala the manifestations of possession

were confined to the simple dramatic imitation of the voice of the 
dead king, whose soul was believed to give counsel in this manner 
to his successor. 

b. Demoniacal possession is a widely spread explanation of such 
psyehopathological conditions as epilepsy, somnambulism, hysteria, 
&e. ; especially in the East Indian field lycanthropy (g.r.)and magical 
power (for evil) are commonly attributed to possession. Much 
of the evidence is that of native witnesses, and where European 
observers have succeeded in examining a case for themselves they 
have generally been guiltless of all knowledge of psychopathology 
and of the possibilities of suggestion ; their statements are therefore 
to be accepted only with reserve. Demoniacal possession is familiar 
to us from the New Testament narratives; there seems to be no 
reason to suppose that the cases there recorded were due to 
anything but disease; but the view is still occasionally maintained 
by Christian apologists that real demon possession existed in 
Judaea. Demoniacs in the New Testament are stated to live among 
the tombs, to be deaf and dumb, or blind, to be possessed by a 
multitude of evil spirits or to suffer from high fever as a result of 
possession; the demons are said to pass into the bodies of animals 
or to reside in waterless places. No facts are recorded which are 
not explicable either as the ordinary symptoms of mental disease 
or as the result of suggestion (q.v.). 

c. In the lower stages of culture all diseases are explained as 
due to the invasion of the body by disease spirits (see Animism), 
but the effects are supposed to be physiological, not psychical as in 
demoniacal possession. The infringement of a totemie tabu, the 
wrath of an ancestor or other dead person or the malice of a disease 
spirit, such as the Malay hantus, or of any non-human spirit, may 
set up pathological conditions, according to animistic philosophy. 
Such cases, as well as those of demoniacal possession, which may 
be distinguished from the inspirational form by their invariably 
involuntary character, are dealt with by a variety of means such as 
spells, purifications, sacrifices to the possessing spirit, or coercion 
of various sorts (see Exorcism). 

We have few data as to the distribution of the phenomena 
here classified. Cases of inspirational or demoniacal possession 
were known in classical times; but the demon of Socrates must 
rather be classed as a case of sensory automatism. In our own 
day they are reported from the greater part of Asia, Africa and 
Polynesia, and they seem to occur in America, though our 
information is scanty. On the other hand in New Guinea and 
Australia they are practically unknown, though automatisms 
are put down to the agency of the dead. 

From the psychological point of view the classification is 
again threefold: (a) as noted above, the majority of cases of 
so-called possession are simply psyehopathological; (b) another 
class, the existence of which has only been recognized within 
recent times are the cases of secondary or multiple personality; 
the apparent independence and occasional conflict of primary 
and secondary selves has been explained by the theory of 
possession; but it has been possible in one of the most severe 
cases on record to unify the two personalities and memories 
after what the patient described as a struggle between them for 
supremacy, which would inevitably have suggested, possession 
as the explanation, had not the issue of the case been the amalga- 
mation of the two streams of consciousness, (c) The problem 
of the third class of cases, which may be termed mediumistic, is 
still unsolved. The medium (q.v.) or sensitive appears to have 
at command in the trance state a store of memories connected 
with the lives of deceased friends of a sitter (i.e. a person present 
at the seance), such memories being dealt with from the stand- 
point of the deceased person (who is termed the communicator); 
sometimes the memories are connected with the friends of a 
person not actually present or with articles placed in the hands 
of the medium, the owners being absent or dead. Mediumistic 
cases have undergone elaborate investigation at the hands of 
the Society for Psychical Research, and no serious attempt has 
been made to invalidate the facts set forward by the investi- 
gators; but so far no satisfactory explanation has been suggested. 
On the one hand thought transference or telepathy (q.v.) appears 
to be insufficient, unless we assume that the powers of a medium 
far transcend anything demonstrable in ordinary telepathic 
experiments; for the facts stated by or through the medium 
about the communicator seem in many cases to be known in 
their entirety to no single living person. If thought transference 
is the explanation, we must admit that the medium can (i) 
ransack all living brains for facts, (2) select those which are 



pertinent (i.e. known to the communicator) and (3) combine 
them in such a way as to suggest that the source of the informa- 
tion is the dead person. On the other hand, although, as we 
have seen, the communications show knowledge homologous 
to that of the deceased, they demonstrably do not include the 
whole of his knowledge; more than one attempt has been made 
to obtain from communicators the contents of sealed letters, 
written during their lifetime and kept from the knowledge of all 
other human beings till the seal was broken; but such attempts 
have so far failed, and the failure seems to form conclusive 
evidence both against possession and against other explanations 
based on the supposition that the dead are communicating.

POSSNECK, a town of Germany, in the duchy of Saxe- 
Meiningen, 21 m. by rail S. of Jena, on the Kotschau. Pop. 
(1905), 12,702. It has a Gothic Evangelical church built about 
1390, and a Gothic town-hall erected during the succeeding cen- 
tury. Its chief industries are the making of flannel, porcelain, 
furniture, machines, musical instruments and chocolate. The 
town has also tanneries, breweries, dye works and brickworks. 
Possneck, which is of Slavonic origin, passed about 1300 to the 
landgrave of Thuringia. Later it belonged to Saxony and later 
still to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, passing to Saxe- 
Meiningen in 1826.

POST. 1. (An adaptation in 0. Eng. of the Lat. postis, 
from ponere, to place), a stock, stake or stump, particularly an 
upright timber used as a support in building, as part of the 
framework of a door, as a boundary mark, &c, and formerly 
as a convenient object to which to attach public notices, &c, 
whence the verb " to post," to publish a notice, advertisement, 
&c, by affixing it in a conspicuous position, hence to make a 
statement with regard to an event or person, e.g. the " posting " 
of a defaulter, or of a ship as overdue or missing at Lloyd's. 

2. (An adaptation of the Fr. paste, station, position, Ital. 
posta or posto, formed from the past participle positus, of Lat. 
ponere, to place), position, station, a position occupied by a 
soldier or body of soldiers, especially one specifically allotted to a 
soldier, such as the round of a sentry, hence a place of employ- 
ment, an office. The sense of station has developed into the 
particular application of the word and its various derivatives, 
" postal," " postage," &c, to the service connected with the 
delivery of letters (see Post and Postal Service). From the 
earliest times as we see from the aryyapeia of the Persian kings 
(Herod, viii. 98), the speedy despatch of messages, letters, &c, 
was attained by relays of men and horses stationed at regular 
intervals. This is paralleled by the dispositi equites of Roman 
times and by the elaborate system of the Great Khan which 
Marco Polo describes on the roads of China. The New English 
Dictionary finds the earliest use of the 0. Fr. poeste and the Ital. 
posta for these stations of men and horses in Marco Polo's 
account. The Medieval Latin expression for the couriers was 
caballarii postarum, riders of the posts. From the stations or 
relays of horses the word was early applied to the riders them- 
selves, and later to the mail carried by means of the " posts," 
and thence to the whole service. At the first establishment of

POST, AND POSTAL SERVICE 



regular posts in the 16th century in England, they served two 
purposes, the carrying of the king's letters and the exclusive 
supply of horses for his couriers and for other travellers, the first 
being called the " posts of the pacquet," the second " the 
thorough posts." When, in 1780, the monopoly of supplying 
post-horses was taken away from the " postmasters," the term 
was retained for the " posting " establishments for travellers 
throughout the country, as well as in such words as " post-boy " 
and " post-chaise." The expression " post-haste," generally 
used adverbially in the sense of " with the utmost speed," was 
originally a superscription, " haste, post, haste," on letters that 
needed the greatest despatch, and was a command addressed 
to the " post," the bearer of the message. The peculiar use of 
" postmaster " as the name of the " scholars " of Merton 
College, Oxford, has not been explained. It occurs in the 
college records first as the name of a building (Postmasters' 
Hall) outside the college, in which the scholars (called portion- 
istae or portionistae) lived until about 1575. The suggestion 
that " postmaster " is a corruption of porlionista is far-fetched, 
and there is nothing to support the theory that the scholars, 
as servitors to the masters, stood behind them at table and were 
thus called post-magistri. 

POST, and POSTAL SERVICE. The germ of modern postal 
systems is to be looked for in the earliest organized establishment 
of a staff of government couriers. In the postal system of Spain 
and the German empire there is express record of permission to 
government couriers to carry letters for individuals in April 1544; 
and within fifteen or sixteen years that permission had grown 
into a legalized and regulated monopoly, whence the counts 
of Taxis drew part of their profits as postmasters-general. In 
Great Britain existing private letters of the 15th century — some, 
perhaps, of the 14th — bear endorsements which show that they 
were conveyed by relays of men and horses maintained under 
the control of the government, and primarily intended for its 
special service. In several states on the continent of Europe 
the universities had inland postal establishments of a rudimen- 
tary sort at an early date. The university of Paris organized 
a postal service almost at the beginning of the 13th century, 
and it lasted in a measure until 1719. In various parts of 
Europe mercantile gilds and brotherhoods were licensed to 
establish posts for commercial purposes. But everywhere — as 
far as the accessible evidence extends — foreign posts were under 
state control. 

Great Britain 

Early History (c. 1533-1836). 

As early as the middle of the 13th century entries occur in 
the wardrobe accounts of the kings of England of payments to 
royal messengers for the conveyance of letters. In 
Century, tne supervision of these royal messengers lies the 
germ of the office of postmaster-general. The first 
English postmaster of whom a distinct account can be given is 
Sir Brian Tuke, who is described (1533) in the records as " Magis- 
ter Nunciorum, Cursorum, sive Postarum," " both in England 
and in other parts of the king's dominions beyond the seas." 
But long subsequent to this appointment of a postmaster- 
general the details of the service were frequently regulated by 
proclamations and by orders in council. Thus, among the 
royal proclamations in the library of the Society of Antiquaries, 
there is one of Philip and Mary (undated, but apparently of 1555) 
which regulates the supply of horses for the conveyance of letters 
to Dover. Again, in July 1556 the lords of the council ordered 
" that the postes betweene this and the Northe should eche of 
them keepe a booke, and make entrye of every lettre that he 
shall receive, the tyme of the deliverie thereof unto his hands, 
with the parties names that shall bring it unto him." Much of 
the business of the foreign postal service to and from England 
during the earlier years of Queen Elizabeth was managed by the 
incorporated " merchant strangers," who appointed a special 
postmaster. When that office fell vacant in 1568 they quarrelled 
about a successor; and the quarrel cost them their privilege. 1

The accession of James I. to the English throne, by neces- 
sitating a more frequent communication between London and 
Scotland, led to improvements in the postal service. 
Special posts had already been established by the j^mesl 
magistrates of certain Scottish towns to convey their 
despatches to and from the court. Thus in 1590 a messenger 
was appointed by the magistrates of Aberdeen with the title of 
"council-post." 2 The new royal orders of 1603 directed (1) that 
the postmasters at the various stages should enjoy the privilege of 
letting horses to " those riding in post (that is to say) with horn 
and guide," by commission or otherwise, and to that end they 
were charged to keep or have in readiness a sufficient number 
of post-horses; (2) that the lawful charge for the hire of each 
horse should be, for public messengers, at the rate of 2§d. a mile, 
" besides the guides' groats," private travellers being left to make 
their own agreements. Finally, it was directed that every post- 
master should keep at least two horses for the express conveyance 
of government letters, and should forward such letters within a 
quarter of an hour of their receipt, and that the posts should 
travel at the rate of not less than 7 m. an hour in summer and 
5 m. in winter. 8 

In 1607 the king 'granted to John Stanhope, first Baron 
Stanhope of Harrington, and to his son Charles Stanhope, after- 
wards second Lord Stanhope, jointly and to the survivor of 
them, the postmastership of England under the title of " Master 
of the Posts and Messengers," with a fee of 100 marks a 
year, together with all " avails and profits " belonging to the 
office. In 1619 a separate office of "postmaster-general of 
England for foreign parts " was created in favour of 
Matthew de Quester 4 and Matthew de Quester the 
younger. The new office was regarded by the exist- ousters. 
ing postmaster-general, Charles, Lord Stanhope, as 
an infringement of his own patent. A long dispute ensued in 
the king's bench and before the lords of the council. 5 In 1626 
by an order in council liberty was granted to all companies of 
merchants, including the merchant adventurers, to send their 
letters and despatches by messengers of their own choosing, A 
year afterwards this liberty was revoked, except for the Company 
of Merchant Adventurers. Lord Stanhope, however, continued 
to carry letters abroad by his agents, and obtained a warrant 
prohibiting De Quester from interfering. It shows strikingly 
the confusion of postal affairs at this period to find a statement 
addressed to the privy council by the postmasters of England 
to the effect that they had received no payments " ever since 
the last day of November 162 1 till this present time, June 1628 " 
— the arrears amounting to £22,626. 

The rights of the postmasters were also infringed by private 
individuals, as by one Samuel Jude in 1629 in the west 
of England. 6 In 1632 the foreign postmastership was assigned 
by De Quester, who had lost his son, to William Frizell and 
Thomas Witherings. Letters-patent were granted to them 
to give their voices to Raphael, . . . but inclined to favour Godfrey " 
(Dom. Cor. Eliz. xlviii. § 65, State Paper Dept., Rolls Office). 
Raphael was a German, Godfrey an Englishman.

6 These disputes weremuch embittered by the growing jealousies 
of English against foreign merchants. The proofs of this in the 
state correspondence of Elizabeth's day are abundant, but there 
were many statesmen who took larger views. See, e.g. John John- 
son's " Brief Declaration for the . . . erecting and maintaining 
of the Staple ... in England " (June 1582), Dom. Corresp. Eliz.

as being " spies for foreign princes," and with Cecil's " Reasons to

POST, AND POSTAL SERVICE

Witherings, 



jointly, the 15th of March 1633. 1 Witherings took the labouring 
oar, and ranks as the first of many conspicuous postal reformers. 
Under him one Richard Poole obtained a special 
a * postmastership for the service of the court. Among 
the earliest measures of improvement taken under the new 
patent was an acceleration of the continental mail service. 
For this purpose the patentees made a contract with the 
count of Thurn and Taxis, hereditary postmaster of the 
Empire and of Spain. At this time there was still but one 
mail weekly between London, Antwerp and Brussels, and the 
transit occupied from four to five days. By a subsequent 
contract with Count Thurn two mails weekly were secured and 
the transit made ordinarily in two days.' In June 1635 Wither- 
ings submitted to the king a proposal " for settling of staffets 
or pacquet-posts betwixt London and all parts of His Majesty's 
dominions, for the carrying and re-carrying of his subjects' 
letters," which contains curious notices of the state of internal 
communications. The net charge to the Crown of the existing 
posts is stated to be £3400 per annum. Letters, it is said, 
" being now carried by carriers or footposts 16 or 18 m. a day, it 
is full two months before any answer can be received from Scot- 
land or Ireland to London. If any of His Majesty's subjects 
shall write to Madrid in Spain, he shall receive answer sooner 
and surer than he shall out of Scotland or Ireland." By the new 
plan it was proposed that all letters for the northern road should 
be put into one " portmantle," and directed to Edinburgh, 
with separate bags directed to such postmasters as lived upon 
the road near to any city or town corporate. The journey from 
London to Edinburgh was to be performed within three days. 
The scheme was approved on the 31st of July 1635, the procla- 
mation establishing eight main postal lines — namely, the great 
northern road, to Ireland by Holyhead, to Ireland by Bristol, 
to the marches of Wales by Shrewsbury, to Plymouth, to Dover, 
to Harwich and to Yarmouth. The postage of a single letter 
was fixed at 2d. if under 80 m., 4d. if between 80 and 140 m., 
6d. if above 140 m., 8d. if to Scotland. It was provided that no 
other messengers or footposts should carry letters to any places 
so provided, except common known carriers, or a particular 
messenger " sent on purpose with a letter by any man for 
his own occasions," or a letter by a friend, on pain of exem- 
plary punishment. 3 In February 1638 another royal procla- 
mation ratified an agreement between Witherings and Dc 
Noveau, postmaster to the French king, for the conveyance of 
the mails into France by Calais, Boulogne, Abbeville and 
Amiens. 4 

But in 1640 the active postmaster was accused of divers 
abuses and misdemeanours, and his office sequestrated into 
the hands of Philip Burlamachi of London, merchant, who was 
to execute the same under the inspection of the principal 
secretary of state. 5 Witherings then assigned his patent to 
Robert Rich, earl of Warwick, and a long contest ensued in 
both houses of parliament. The sequestration was declared 
by a vote in parliament in 1642 to be illegal. Nevertheless 
the dispute gave repeated occupation to both houses during the 
period from 1641 to 1647, and was diversified by several affrays, 
in which violent hands were laid upon the mails. In 1643 the 
post office yielded only £5000 a year. In 1644 the Lords and 
Commons by a joint ordinance appointed Edmund Prideaux 
" to be master of the posts, messengers and couriers." In 1646 
the opinion of the judges was taken on the validity of Wither- 
ings's patent (assigned to Lord Warwick), and they pronounced 
that " the clauses of restraint in the said patent are void and not 
good in law; that, notwithstanding these clauses be void, the 
patent is good for the rest." 8 It is evident, therefore, that any 

1 Minute in " House of Lords' Papers " (1633), Fourth Report of 
Hist. MSS. Commission (1874), app. The papers there calendared 
contain many proofs of Witherings s activity and ability. See also 
appendix to Fifth Report (1875), and " A proclamation concerning 
the Postmaster of England for Forraigne Parts" (July 19, 1632),

prohibition to carry letters must be by act of parliament to 
have force of law. 

In 1650 an attempt was made by the common council of 
London to organize a new postal system on the great roads, to 
run twice a week. This scheme they temporarily 
carried into effect as respects Scotland. But Mr Cromwell 
Attorney-General Prideaux urged on the council 
of state that, if the new enterprise were permitted, besides 
intrenching on the rights of the parliament, some other means 
would have to be devised for payment of the postmasters. Both 
houses resolved (1) that the offices of postmasters, inland and 
foreign, were, and ought to be, in the -sole power and disposal of 
the parliament, and (2) that it should be referred to the council 
of state to take into consideration all existing claims in relation 
thereto. Of these there were 5wq under the various patents 
which had been granted. Thereupon the Protector was advised 
that the management of the post office should be entrusted to 
John Thurioe by patent upon the expiration of John Maniey's 
existing contract. Thurioe was to give security for payment 
of the existing rent of £10,000 a year. Ultimately the posts, 
both inland and foreign, were farmed to John Manley for £10,000 
a year, by an agreement made in 1653. Meanwhile an attorney 
at York, named John Hill, placed relays of post- 
horses between that city and London, and undertook Reforms * 
the conveyance of letters and parcels at half the 
former rates. He also formed local and limited partnerships 
in various parts of the kingdom for the extension of his plan, 
which aimed to establish eventually a general penny postage 
for England, a twopenny postage for Scotland and a fourpenny 
postage for Ireland. But the post office was looked upon by 
the government of the day as, first, a means of revenue, and 
secondly, a means of political espionage. 7 The new letter- 
carriers were " trampled down " by Cromwell's soldiery. The 
inventor had a narrow escape from severe punishment. He 
lived to publish (1659) the details of his plan, at the eve of the 
Restoration, in a pamphlet entitled A Penny Post: or a Vindica- 
tion of the Liberty and Birthright of every Englishman in carrying 
Merchants and other Man's letters, against any Restraint of 
Farmers, &c. It is probable that this publication 8 helped to 
prepare the way for those measures of partial but far-reaching 
reform which were effected during the reign of Charles II. The 
rates of postage and the rights and duties of postmasters were 
settled under the Protectorate by an act of parb'ament of 1657, 
c. 30. In 1659 the item, " by postage of letters in farm, £14,000," 
appears in a report on the public revenue.' 

The government of the Restoration continued to farm the 
post office upon conditions similar to those imposed by the act 
of 1657, but for a larger sum. Henry Bishop, the 
first postmaster-general in the reign of Charles II., cbariesll. 
contracted to pay a yearly rent of £21,500, these new 
arrangements being embodied in the Act 12 Charles II. c. 35 
(1660), entitled " An Act for Erecting and Establishing a Post 
Office." A clause proposing to frank all letters addressed to 
or sent by members of parliament during the session was

7 Illustrations of this may be seen (in the state-paper department

Sir John Coke and Lord Conway, and also in many other state 
letters, as well after the outbreak of the great rebellion as before 
it. There is in the Bodleian Library (MS. Rawlinson, A. 477) a 
minute account of the methods alleged to have been pursued in 
the systematic and periodical examination of letters entrusted to 
the post office. The paper is not authenticated by any signature, 
and is undated. But it is an original document of the time of 
Charles II., addressed to Mr. Bridgman, clerk of thecouncil, and 
drawn up to recommend the adoption of a like practice, but with 
greater dexterity than that used by Dr Dorislaus and Samuel 
Morland, who, according to this narrative, formed the CromweHian 
board of examiners for post-office letters, and who read all that were 
addressed to foreign parts.

POST, AND POSTAL SERVICE 



rejected by the Lords. But the indenture enrolled with the 
letters-patent contained a proviso for the free carriage of all 
letters to or from the king, the great officers of state and also the 
single inland letters only of the members of that present parlia- 
ment during that session. It also provided that the lessee 
should permit the secretaries of state, or either of them, to have 
the survey and inspection of all letters at their discretion. 
Bishop was succeeded by Daniel O'Neill 1 in 1662, on similar 
terms. In the consequent proclamation, issued on the 25th of 
May 1663, it was commanded that " no postmasters or other 
officers that shall be employed in the conveying of letters, or 
distributing of the same, or any other person or persons, . . *. 
except by the immediate warrant of our principal secretaries of 
state, shall presume to open any letters or pacquets not directed 
unto themselves." In 1677 the general post office comprised 
in the chief office, under Henry Bennet, earl of Arlington, as 
postmaster-general, seventy-five persons, and its profits were 
farmed for £43,000 a year. There were then throughout England 
and Scotland 182 deputy postmasters, and in Ireland 18 officers 
at the Dublin office and 45 country postmasters. " The number 
of letters missive," says a writer of the same year, " is now 
prodigiously great. ... A letter comprising one whole sheet of 
paper is conveyed 80 m. for twopence. Every twenty-four 
hours the post goes 1 20 m., and in five days an answer may be 
had from a place 300 m. distant." 2 By an act of the 15th 
Charles II. (" An Act for Settling the Profits of the Post Office 
on the duke of York, and his Heirs-Male "), and by a subsequent 
proclamation issued in August 1683, it was directed that the 
postmaster-general should " take effectual care for the convey- 
ance of all bye-letters, by establishing correspondences ... in 
all considerable market-towns with the next adjacent post- 
stage," and the rights of the postmasters as to hiring horses 
were again emphasized. 

During the possession of the post-office profits by the duke of 
York a London penny post was established by the joint enter- 
Dockwra's prise of William Dockwra, a searcher at the customs- 
Loadoa house, and of Robert Murray, a clerk in the excise 
Penny Post office The wor king-out of the plan fell to the first- 
named, and in his hands it gave in April 1680 — although 
but for a short time — far more extensive postal facilities to 
the Londoners than even those afforded 160 years later by 
the plans of Sir Rowland Hill. Dockwra carried, registered 
and insured^ for a penny, both letters and parcels up to a 
pound in weight and £10 in value. He took what had been 
the mansion of Sir Robert Abdy in Lime Street as a chief office, 
established seven sorting and district offices, and between 400 
and 500 receiving-houses and wall-boxes. He established 
hourly collections, with a maximum of ten deliveries daily for 
the central part of the city, and a minimum of six for the suburbs. 
Outlying villages, such as Hackney and Islington, had four daily 
deliveries; and his letter-carriers collected for each despatch of 
the general post office throughout the whole of the city and 
suburbs. Suits were laid against him in the court of king's 
bench for infringing on the duke of York's patent, and the 
jealousies of the farmers eventually prevailed. The penny post 
was made a branch of the general post. Dockwra, after the 
Revolution of 1688, obtained a pension of £500 a year (for a 
limited term) in compensation of his losses. In 1697 he was 
made comptroller of the London office. Eleven years later his 
improvements were outvied by Charles Povey, the author of 
schemes for improving coinage, and also of a curious volume, 
often wrongly ascribed to Defoe, entitled The Visions of Sir 
Heister Ryley. Povey took upon himself to set up a foot-post 
under the name of the " halfpenny carriage," appointed 
receiving-houses, and employed several persons to collect and 
deliver letters for hire within the cities of London and West- 
minster and borough of Southwark, " to the great prejudice of 

1 The trusted friend but not always the trusted adviser of the 
duke^ of Ormonde. O'Neill's correspondence exists among the 
duke's papers, in part at Kilkenny Castle, in part (extensively) 
among the Carte MSS. in the Bodleian; and it abounds in incidental 
illustrations of postal administration in both England and Ireland.

the revenue," as was represented by the postmaster-general to 
the lords of the treasury. Povey was compelled to desist. 

At this period the postal system of Scotland was distinct from 
that of England. It had been reorganized early in the reign of 
Charles II.. who in September 1662 had appointed 
Patrick Grahame of Inchbrakie to be postmaster- Earl y 
general of Scotland for life at a salary of £500 Scots. ^ottlsh 
But it would seem from the proceedings of the Scottish P° stai 
privy council that the rights and duties of the office s ? stem - 
were ill defined ; for immediately after the appointment of Grahame 
the council commissioned Robert Mein, merchant and keeper of the 
letter-office in Edinburgh, to establish posts between Scotland and 
Ireland, ordained that Linlithgow, Kilsyth, Glasgow, Kilmarnock, 
Dumboag, Ballantrae and Portpatrick should be stages on the route, 
and granted him the sum of £200 sterling to build a packet-boat 
to carry the mail from Portpatrick to Donaghadee.' 

Perhaps the earliest official notice of the colonial post is to be 
seen in the following paragraph from the records of the general 
court of Massachusetts in 1639. " It is ordered that 
notice be given that Richard Fairbanks his house in rtt 
Boston is the place appointed for all letters which are 2, 
brought from beyond the seas, or are to be sent thither * 

to be left with him; and he is to take care that they are to be delivered 
or sent according to the directions; and he is allowed for every letter 
a penny, and must answer all miscarriages through his own neglect 
in this kind." The court in 1667 was petitioned to make better 
postal arrangements, the petitioners alleging the frequent " loss 
of letters whereby merchants, especially with their friends and 
employers in foreign parts, are greatly damnified ; many times the 
letters are imputed (?) and thrown upon the exchange, so that those 
who will may take them up, no person, without some satisfaction, 
being willing to trouble their houses therewith." In Virginia the 
postal system was yet more primitive. The colonial law of 1657 
required every planter to provide a messenger to convey the 
despatches as they arrived to the next plantation, and so on, on pain 
of forfeiting a hogshead of tobacco in default. The government 
of New York in 1672 established " a post to goe monthly from 
New York to Boston," advertising " those that bee disposed to 
send letters, to bring them to the secretary's office, where, in a 
Iockt box, they shall be preserved till the messenger calls for them, 
all persons paying the post before the bagg be sealed up." * Thirty 
years later this monthly post had become a fortnightly one. The 
office of postmaster-general for America had been created in 1692. 

The act of the 9th of Queen Anne which consolidated the 
posts of the empire into one establishment, and, as to organiza- 
tion, continued to be the great charter of the post 
office until the reforms of 1 838-1 850 mainly intro- sotidation' 
duced by Sir Rowland Hill. The act of Anne 
largely increased the powers of the postmaster-general. It 
reorganized the chief letter-offices of Edinburgh, Dublin 
and New York, and settled new offices in the West Indies 
and elsewhere. It established three rates of single postage, 
viz. English, 3d. if under 80 m. and 4d. if above, and 6d. 
to Edinburgh or Dublin. It continued to the postmaster- 
general the sole privilege " to provide horses to persons riding 
post." And it gave, for the first time, parliamentary sanction 
to the power ,** formerly questionable, of the secretaries of state 
with respect to the opening of letters, by enacting that " from 
and after the first day of June 171 1 no person or persons shall 
presume ... to open, detain or delay . . . any letter or letters . . . 
after the same is or shall be delivered into the general or other 
post office, . . . and before delivery to the persons to whom they 
are directed, or for their use, except by an express warrant in 
writing under the hand of one of the principal secretaries of stcte^ 
for every such openings detaining or delaying" 

Nine years after the passing of the act of Anne the cross-posts 
were farmed to the well-known " humble " Ralph Allen — the 
lover of peace and of humanity. 6 Allen became 
the inventor of the cross-roads postal system, p^'™ 
having made an agreement that the new profits 
so created should be his own during his lifetime. His im- 
provements were so successful that he is said to have netted 
during forty-two years an average profit of nearly £12,000 
a year.

The system of burdening the post-office revenue with pensions, 
nearly all of which had no public connexion with the postal service, 
Per m *n* n * and some of wmcn were unconnected with any public 
teasloas ^^cc, was begun by Charles II., who granted to 
' Barbara, duchess of Cleveland, £4700 a year, and to 
the earl of Rochester £4000 a year, out of that revenue. The 
example was followed until, in 1694, the pensions so chargeable 
amounted to £2 1,200. Queen Anne granted a pension of £5000 
t0 , thc duke of Marlborough, charged in like manner. In March 
1857 the existing pensions ceased to be payable by the post office, 
and became chargeable to the consolidated fund. 

In October 1782 the notice of the manager of the Bath theatre, 
John Palmer (174 2-1 8 18), was attracted to the postal service. 
Palmer's So habitual were the robberies of the post that they 
Mali- came to be regarded as necessary evils. The officials 

coaches. urged the prccaut i on f sending all bank-notes and 
bills of exchange in halves, and pointed the warning with a 
philosophical remark that " there are no other means of prevent- 
ing robberies with effect." At this period the postal system 
was characterized by extreme irregularity in the departure of 
mails and delivery of letters by an average speed of about 
35 m. in the hour, and by a rapidly increasing diversion of corre- 
spondence into illicit channels. The net revenue, which had 
averaged £167,176 during the ten years ending with 1773, 
averaged but £159,625 during the ten years ending with 1783. 
Yet, when Palmer suggested that by building mail-coaches 
expressly adapted to run at a good speed, by furnishing a liberal 
supply of horses, and by attaching an armed guard to each coach 
the public would be greatly benefited, and the post-office revenue 
considerably increased, the officials maintained that the existing 
system was all but perfect. Lord Camden, however, brought 
the plan under the personal notice of Pitt, who insisted on its 
being tried. The experiment was made in August 1784, and its 
success exceeded all anticipation. The following table shows 
the rapid increase of revenue under the new arrangements: —

It had been at first proposed to reward Palmer by a grant 
for life of 2}% on a certain proportion of the increased 
net revenue, which would eventually have given him some 
£10,000 a year, but this proposition fell through. Pitt, however, 
appointed Palmer to be comptroller-general of postal revenues, 
an office which was soon made too hot for him to hold. He 
obtained a pension of £3000 a year, and ultimately, by the act 
53 Geo. III. c. 157 (1813), after his case had received the sanction 
of five successive majorities against government, an additional 
sum of £50,000. Every sort of obstruction was placed in the 
way of his reward, although nearly a million had been added to 
the annual pubb'c revenue, and during a quarter of a century the 
mails had been conveyed over an aggregate of some seventy 
millions of miles without the occurrence of one serious mail 
robbery. 1

Scotland shared in the advantages of the mail-coach system from 
the first. Shortly before its introduction the local penny post was 
set on foot in Edinburgh by Peter Williamson, the keeper 
of a coffee-room in the hall of Parliament House. \{ e Scottish and 
employed four letter-carriers, in uniform, appointed Msb Posi 
receivers in various parts of the city, and established ° ffke > iros * 
hourly deliveries. 2 The officials of the post, when the l80L 
success of the plan had become fully apparent, gave Williamson a 
pension, and absorbed his business, the acquisition of which was 
subsequently confirmed by the Act 34 Geo. III. c. 17 (1794). A 
dead-letter office was established in 1784. But in Ireland in 1801 
only three public carriages conveyed mails. There were, indeed, 
few roads of any sort, and none on which coaches could travel faster 
than four miles an hour. 1 At this period the gross receipts of the 
Irish post office were £80,040; the charges of management and 
collection were £59.216, or at the rate of more than 70%; whilst 
in Scotland the receipts were £100,651, and the charges £16,896, or 
somewhat lessthan 17%.* 

In the^ American colonics postal improvements may be dated from 
the administration of Franklin, who was virtually the last colonial 
postmaster-general, as well as the best. In one shape 
or another he had forty years' experience of postal Praaklla. 
Work, having been appointed postmaster at Philadelphia in October 
1737. When he became postmaster-general in 1753 he visited all 
the chief post offices throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New 
York and New England, looking at everything with his own eyes. 
His administration cannot be better summed up than we find it 
to be in a sentence or two which he wrote soon after his dismissal. 
Up to the date of his appointment, he says, " the American post 
office had never paid anything to that of Britain. We [i.e. himself 
and his assistant] were to have £600 a year between us, if we could 
make that sum out of the profits of the office. ... In the first four 
years the office became above £900 in debt to us. But it soon 
after be^an to repay us; and before I was displaced by a freak of the 
ministers, we had brought it to yield three times as much clear 
revenue to the Crown as the post office of Ireland. Since that 
imprudent transaction they have received from it — not one farthing." 
The interval between the development of Palmer's methods, 
and the reforms introduced twenty-seven years later by Sir Rowland 
Hill, is chiefly marked by the growth of the packet system, under 
the influence of steam navigation, and by the elaborate investiga- 
tions of the revenue commissioners of 1826 and the following years. 
In some important particulars these mark out practical and most 
valuable reforms," but they contrasted unfavourably with the 
lucidity and reasoning of Rowland Hill's Post Office Reform. 

As early as 1788 the cost of the packets employed by the post 
office attracted parliamentary attention. In that year the " com- 
missioners of fees and gratuities " reported that in the 
preceding seventeen years the total cost of this branch p * cke * 
had amounted to £1,038,133; and they naturally laid Scrvkcs - 
stress on the circumstance that many officers of the post office 
were owners of such packets, even down to the chamber-keeper. 
At this time part of the packet service was performed by hired 
vessels, and part by vessels which were the property of the Crown. 
The commissioners recommended that the latter should be sold, 
and the entire service be provided for by public and competitive 
tender. The subject was again inquired into by the finance com- 
mittee of 1798, which reported that the recommendation of 1788 
had not been fully acted upon, and expressed its concurrence in 
that recommendation. The plan was then to a considerable extent 
enforced. But the war rapidly increased the expenditure. The 
average (£61,000) of 1771-1787 had increased in 1797 to /78.41Q. 
in 1810 to £105,000, in 1814 to £160,603. In the succeeding vears 
of peace the expense fell to an average of about £85,000. As early 
as 1818 the Rob Roy " plied regularly between Greenock and 
Beltast;but no use was made of steam navigation for the postal 
service until 182 1, when the postmaster-general established Crown 
packets.^ The expenditure under the new system, from that date 
to 1829 inclusive, was thus reported by the commissioners of revenue 
inquiry in 1830: —

Before passing to the reform of 1839 we have to revert to that 
important feature in postal history — the interference with corre- 
- m spondence for judicial or political purposes. We have 
uovero' already seen (1) that this assumption had no parlia- 
Tnterfereace menta ry sanction until the enactment of the 9th of 
with Com- Q ueen Anne ; (2) that the enactment differed from the 
spondence* r °y^ proclamations in directing a special warrant for 
each opening or detention of correspondence. It is a sig- 
nificant gloss on the statute to find that for nearly a century (namely, 
until 1 798 inclusive) it was not the practice to record sucn warrants 
regularly in any official book. 1 Of the use to which the power was 
applied the state trials afford some remarkable instances. At the 
trial of Bishop Atterbury, for example, in 1723 certain letters were 
offered in evidence which a clerk of the post office deposed on oath 
41 to be true copies of the originals, which were stopped at the post 
office and copied, and sent forward as directed.** Hereupon Atter- 
bury asked this witness " if he had any express warrant under the 
hand of one of the principal secretaries of state for opening the said 
letters.'* But the lords shelved his objection on the grounds of 
public inexpediency. Twenty-nine peers recorded their protest 
against this decision. 2 But the practice thus sanctioned appears 
to have been pushed to such lengths as to elicit in April 1 735 a strong 
protest and censure from the House of Commons. A committee 
of inquiry was appointed, and after receiving its report the house 
resolved that it was " an high infringement of the privileges of the 
. . . Commons of Great Britain in Parliament that letters of any 
member should be opened or delayed without a warrant of a principal 
secretary of state.*' 

Sir Rowland HilVs Reforms (1836-1842). 

Rowland Hill's pamphlet (Post Office Reform) of 1837 took for 
its starting-point the fact that, whereas the postal revenue 
showed for the past twenty years a positive though slight 
diminution, it ought to have showed an increase of £507,700 a 
year in order to have simply kept pace with the growth of 
population, and an increase of nearly four times that amount in 
order to have kept pace with the growth of the analogous though 
far less exorbitant duties imposed on stage-coaches. The stage- 
coach duties had produced, in 181 5, £217,671; in 1835 they 
produced £498,497. In 1837 there did not exist any precise 
account of the number of letters transmitted through the general 
post office. Hill, however, was able to prepare a sufficiently 
approximate estimate from the data of the London district post, 
and from the sums collected for postage. He thus calculated 
the number of chargeable letters at about 88,600,000, that of 
franked letters at 7 ,400,000, and that of newspapers at 30,000,000, 
giving a gross total of about 126,000,000. At this period the 
total cost of management and distribution was £696,569. In 
the finance accounts of the year (1837) deductions are made from 
the gross revenue for letters " refused, missent, redirected," and 
the like, which amount to about £122,000. An analysis of the 
component parts of this expenditure assigned £426,517 to cost 
of primary distribution and £270,052 to cost of secondary distri- 
bution and miscellaneous charges. A further analysis of the 
primary distribution expenditure gave £282,308 as the probable 
outgoings for receipt and delivery, and £144,209 as the probable 
outgoings for transit. In other words, the expenditure which 
hinged upon the distance the letters had to be conveyed was 

1 Report of Secret Committee on the Post Office (1844), p. 9. 
3 Lords 1 Journals, xxii. 183-186; State Trials, xvi. 540 seq. 



£144,000, and that which had nothing to do with distance was 
£282,000. Applying to these figures the estimated number of 
letters and newspapers (126,000,000) passing through the office, 
there resulted a probable average cost of ^fo of a penny for each, 
of which -3^5- wa s cost of transit and ^j- cost of receipt, delivery, 
&c. Taking into account, however, the greater weight of news- 
papers and franked letters as compared with chargeable letters, 
the apparent average cost of transit became, by this estimate^ 
but about r?r> or less than -rV of a penny. 

A detailed estimate of the cost of conveying a letter from London 
to Edinburgh, founded upon the average weight of the Edinburgh 
mail, gave a still lower proportion, since it reduced the apparent 
cost oftransit, on the average, to the thirty-sixth part of one penny. 
Hill inferred that, if the charge for postage were to be made pro- 
portionate to the whole expense incurred in the receipt, transit 
and delivery of the letter, and in the collection of its postage, it 
must be made uniformly the same from every post-town to every 
other post-town in the United Kingdom, unless it could be shown 
how we are to collect so small a sum as the thirty-sixth part of a 
penny. And, inasmuch as it would take a ninefold weight to make 
the expense of transit amount to one farthing, he further inferred 
that, taxation apart, the charge ought to be precisely the same for 
every packet of moderate weight, without reference to the number 
of its enclosures. 

At this period the rate of postage actually imposed (beyond 
the limits of the London district office) varied from 4d. to is. 8d. 
for a single letter, which was interpreted to mean a single piece 
of paper not exceeding an ounce in weight; a second piece of 
paper or any other enclosure, however small, constituted the 
packet a double letter. A single sheet of paper, if it at all 
exceeded an ounce in weight, was charged with fourfold postage. 
The average charge on inland general post letters was nearly 9d. 
for each. It was proposed that the charge for primary distribu- 
tion — that is to say, the postage on all letters received in a 
post-town, and delivered in the same or in any other post-town 
in the British Isles — should be at the uniform rate of one penny 
for each half-ounce — all letters and other papers, whether single 
or multiple, forming one packet, and not weighing more than 
half an ounce, being charged one penny, and heavier packets, to 
any convenient limit, being charged an additional penny for 
each additional half-ounce. It was further proposed that 
stamped covers should be sold to the public at such a price as 
to include the postage, which would thus be collected in advance. 3 
By the public generally, and pre-eminently by the trading 
public, the plan was received with favour. By the pariia- 
functionaries of the post office it was denounced as mentary 
ruinous and visionary. In 1838 petitions poured Action. 
into the House of Commons. A select committee was appointed, 
which reported as follows: — 

" The principal points which appear to your committee to have 
been established in evidence are the following: (1) the exceed- 
ingly slow advance and occasionally retrograde movement of the 
post office revenue during the . . . last twenty years; (2) the fact 
of the charge of postage exceeding the cost in a manifold propor- 
tion; (3) the fact of postage being evaded most extensively by all 
classes of society, and of correspondence being suppressed, more 
especially among the middle and working classes of the people, 
and this in consequence, as all the witnesses, including many of 
the post office authorities, think, of the excessively high scale 
of taxation; (4) the fact of very injurious effects resulting from 
this state of things to the commerce and industry of the country, 
and to the social habits and moral condition of the' people; (5) the 
fact, as far as conclusions can be drawn from very imperfect data, 
that whenever on former occasions large reductions in the rates 
have been made, these reductions have been followed in short 
periods of time by an extension of correspondence proportionate 
to the contraction of the rates; (6) and, as matters of inference 
from fact and of opinion — (i.) that the only remedies for the 
evils above stated are a reduction of the rates, and the establish- 
ment of additional deliveries, and more frequent despatches of 
letters; (ii.) that owing to the rapid extension of railroads there 
is an urgent and daily increasing necessity for making such 
changes; (iii.) that any moderate reduction in the rates would

occasion loss to the revenue, without in any material degree 
diminishing the present amount of letters irregularly conveyed, 
or giving rise to the growth of new correspondence; (iv.) that 
the principle of a low uniform rate is just in itself, and, when 
combined with prepayment and collection by means of a 
stamp, would be exceedingly convenient and highly satisfactory 
to the public." 

A bill to enable the treasury to establish uniform penny 
postage was carried in the House of Commons by a majority of 

loo, and became law on the 17th of August 1839. A 
Reforms. temporary office was created to enable Rowland Hill 

to superintend the working out of his plan. The 
first step taken was to reduce, on the 5th of December 1839, the 
London district postage to id. and the general inland postage 
to 4d. the half -ounce (existing lower rates being continued). 
On the 10th of January 1840 the uniform penny rate came into 
operation throughout the United Kingdom — the scale of weight 
advancing from id. for each of the first two half -ounces, by 
gradations of 2d. for each additional ounce, or fraction of an 
ounce, up to 16 oz. The postage was to be prepaid, and if not 
to be charged at double rates. Parliamentary franking was 
abolished. Postage stamps were introduced in May following. 
The facilities of despatch were soon afterwards increased by the 
establishment of day mails. 

But oh the important point of simplification in the internal 
economy of the post office, with the object of reducing its cost 
without diminishing its working power, little was done. The 
plan had to work in the face of rooted mistrust on the part of 
the workers. Its author was (for a term of two years, afterwards 
prolonged to three) the officer, not of the post office, but of the 
treasury. He could only recommend measures the most indis- 
pensable through the chancellor of the exchequer. It happened, 
too, that the scheme had to be tried at a period of severe com- 
mercial depression. Nevertheless, the results actually attained 

in the first two years were briefly these: (1) the 

chargeable letters delivered in the United Kingdom, 
exclusive of that part of the government correspondence which 
theretofore passed free, had already increased from the rate of 
about 75,000,000 a year to that of 196,500,000; (2) the London 
district post letters had increased from about 13,000,000 to 
23,000,000, or nearly in the ratio of the reduction of the rates; 

(3) the illicit conveyance of letters was substantially suppressed; 

(4) the gross revenue, exclusive of repayments, yielded about a 
million and a half per annum, which was about 63% of the 
amount of the gross revenue in 1839. These results at so early 
a stage, and in the face of so many obstructions, vindicated the 
new system. 

Seven years later (1849) the 196,500,000 letters delivered 
throughout the United Kingdom in 1842 had increased to nearly 
329,000,000. In addition, the following administrative improve- 
ments had been effected: (1) the time for posting letters at the 
' London receiving-houses extended; (2) the limitation of weight 
abolished; (3) an additional daily despatch to London from the 
neighbouring (as yet independent) villages; (4) the postal arrange- 
ments of 120 of the largest cities and great towns revised; (5) un- 
limited writing on inland newspapers authorized on payment of 
an additional penny; (6) a summary process established for recovery 
of postage from the senders of unpaid letters when refused; (7) a 
book-post established; (8) registration reduced from one shilling 
to sixpence; (9) a third mail daily put on the railway (without 
additional charge) from the towns of the north-western district to 
London, and day mails extended within a radius of 20 m. round 
the metropolis; (10) a service of parliamentary returns, for private 
bills, provided for; (11) measures taken, against many obstacles, 
for the complete consolidation of the two heretofore distinct corps 
of letter-carriers — an improvement (on the whole) of detail, which 
led to other improvements thereafter, 1 

Later History (j&^-ipoj). 
When Sir R. Hill initiated his reform the postmaster-general 
was the earl of Lichfield, the thirty-first in succession to that 

1 Hill, History of Penny Postage (1880), appendix A (Life, &c, 
ii. 438). Part of the strenuousness of the opposition to this measure 
arose, it must be owned, from the " high-handedness " which in 
Sir R. Hill's character somewhat marred very noble faculties. The 
change worked much harm to some humble but hardworking and 
meritorious functionaries. 



office after Sir Brian Tuke. Under him the legislation of 1839 
was carried out in 1840 and 1841. In September 1841 he was 
succeeded by Viscount Lowther. 

In the summer of 1844 the statement that the letters of 
Mazzini, then a political refugee, long resident in England, had 
been systematically opened, and their contents openinjtnd 
communicated to foreign governments, by Sir James Detention 0/ 
Graham, secretary of state for the home department, Letters. 
aroused much indignation. The arrest of the brothers 
Bandicra, 2 largely in consequence of information derived 
from their correspondence with Mazzini, and their subsequent 
execution at Cosenza made a thorough investigation into 
the circumstances a public necessity. The consequent parlia- 
mentary inquiry of August 1844, after retracing the earlier 
events connected with the exercise of the discretional power 
of inspection which parliament had vested in the secretaries of 
state in 1710, elicited the fact that in 1806 Lord Spencer, 
then secretary for the home department, introduced for the first 
time the practice of recording in an official book all warrants 
issued for the detention and opening of letters, and also the 
additional fact that from 1822 onwards the warrants themselves 
had been preserved. The whole number of such warrants 
issued from 1806 to the middle of 1844 inclusive was stated to 
be .323, of which no less than 53 had been issued in the years 
1 841-1844 inclusive, a number exceeding that of any previous 
period of like extent. 

The committee of 1844 proceeded to report that " the warrants 
issued during the present century may be divided into two classes 
— 1st, those issued in furtherance of criminal justice . . . ; 2nd, 
those issued for the purpose of discovering the designs of persons 
known or suspected to be engaged in proceedings dangerous to 
the State, or (as in -Mazzini *s case) deeply involving British 
interests, and carried on in the United Kingdom or in British 
possessions beyond the seas. . . . Warrants of the second descrip- 
tion originate with the home office. The principal secretary of 
state, of his own discretion, determines when to issue them, and 
gives instructions accordingly to the under-secretary, whose 
office is then purely ministerial. The mode of preparing them, 
and keeping record of them in a private book, is the same as in 
the case of criminal warrants. There is no record kept of the 
grounds on which they are issued, except so far as correspondence 
preserved at the home office may lead to infer them. 5 . . . The 
letters which have been detained and opened are, unless retained 
by special order, as sometimes happens in criminal cases, closed 
and resealed, without affixing any mark to indicate that they 
have been so detained and opened, and are forwarded by post 
according to their respective superscriptions." 4 

Almost forty years later a like question was again raised in the 
House of Commons (March 1882) by some Irish members, in 
relation to an alleged examination of correspondence at Dublin 
for political reasons. Sir William Harcourt on that occasion 
spoke thus: " This power is with the secretary of state in Eng- 
land. ... In Ireland it belongs to the Irish government. ... It is 
a power which is given for purposes of state, and the very essence 
of the power is that no account [of its exercise] can be rendered. 
To render an account would be to defeat the very object for 
which the power was granted. If the minister is not fit to 
exercise the power so entrusted, upon the responsibility cast 
upon him, he is not fit to occupy the post of secretary of state." 5 
The House of Commons- accepted this explanation; and in view 
of many grave incidents, both in Ireland and in America, it 
would be hard to justify any other conclusion.

speedily gave a more vigorous impulse to the progress of the

years 1845-1851 inclusive the average was but £810,951.

Within a period of eighteen years under the penny rate the number 
of letters became more than sixfold what it was under the rates 
of 1838. When the change was first made the increase of letters 
was in the ratio of 122*25% during the year. The second year 
showed an increase on the first of about 16%. During the next 
fifteen years the average increase was at the rate of about 6% per 
annum. Although this enormous increase of business, coupled 
with the increasing preponderance of railway mail conveyance 
(invaluable, but costly), carried up the post office expenditure from 
£757,ooo to £1,720,800, yet the net revenue of 1857 was within 
£350,000 of the net revenue of 1839. During the year 1857 the 
number of newspapers delivered in the United Kingdom was about 
71 millions, and that of ^ book-packets (the cheap carriage of which 
is one of the most serviceable and praiseworthy of modern postal 
improvements) about 6 millions. 

Since 1858 the achievements of the period 1835-1857 have been 
eminently surpassed. This period includes the establishment 
of postal savings banks (1861) and the transfer to the state of 
Growth the telegraphic service (1870). These improvements 
and are dealt with in separate articles. The British 

Changes, postal business has grown at a more rapid rate than 
the population of the United Kingdom. Some of the 
causes of this development must be sought within the post 
office department, e.g. improved facilities, lower charges and 
the assumption of new functions; but others are to be found 
in the higher level of popular education, the increase of wealth, 
industry and commerce, and the rapid expansion of Greater 
Britain. 
The following table shows the growth of letters delivered: — 
United Kingdom. — Estimated inland delivery of letters, 
1 839-1905, with the increase per cent, per annum. Also the 
average number to each person, oo,ooo's omitted. 



The rates of inland letter postage have been altered as 
follows. From the 5th of October 1871 to the 1st of July 1885 
the charges were: not exceeding 1 oz. one penny; inland 
over 1 oz. and not exceeding 2 oz. three halfpence, Letter 
and an additional halfpenny for every 2 oz., so Rates. 
that the postage on a letter weighing between 10 and 
12 oz. was 4d. On a letter weighing over 12 oz. and not 
exceeding 13 oz. the postage was is. id., and increased id. for 
each succeeding ounce. On the 1st of July 1885 the postage on 
letters over 12 oz. was reduced, and the gradation of charge 
beyond 2 oz. was made uniform, at the rate of one halfpenny for 
each additional ounce. Thus a letter weighing over 1 2 and not 
exceeding 14 oz. was charged 4^d., 14 to 16 oz. 5d., and so on. 
Notwithstanding this change, it was found as late as 1895 that 
95% of the letters sent through the post weighed not more 
than 1 oz. each. 

Among a number of postal and telegraphic concessions made 
to the public on the 22nd of June 1897, the sixtieth anniversary 
of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne, were new rates for 
letters as follows: — 

d. 

Not exceeding 4 oz .1 

Over 4 oz. and not exceeding 6 oz ij 

,, O ,, ,, ,, o ,, 2 

with id. for each succeeding 2 oz. 

This change, while it saved both the post office and the public 
the trouble of testing the weight of a large number of letters, 
had also the advantage of simplicity of calculation — one half- 
penny is charged for each 2 oz., with a minimum charge of id. 

Arrangements were at the same time made to ensure a delivery 
of letters^ by postmen at every house in the United Kingdom. 
It was estimated that 16 millions of letters, whose owners had previ- 
ously to fetch them from the post office or from some point on a 
postman's walk, would thus be added to the official delivery. 
The estimate proved to be much under the mark, some 60 millions 
being added to the letters brought annually into the official delivery 
under this arrangement. Financial considerations have now been 
entirely disregarded for the benefit of these letters, and the cost of 
their delivery alone greatly exceeds the whole revenue derived 
from them. 

In studying the statistics of letters delivered, it should be re- 
membered that the figures for any particular year are affected 
by circumstances like a general election or a boom in trade, as 
well as by changes in the rates or condition of the post office 
services. The letters from foreign countries have been stimu- 
lated by lower charges, and those from the colonies by the 
imperial penny post, to which reference is made below.

1 It was* discovered in the course of this year that the estimated 
figures for previous years had been swollen by an imperfect method 
of reckoning the London letters, &c. In 1883 as many as 2,770,000 
valentines were sent through the post. The numbers gradually 



decreased until in 1890 only 320,000 were observed. Christmas- 
cards have, however, considerably increased. 

1 Since the 22nd of June 1897, all packets over 2 oz., formerly 
counted as book packets, are reckoned as letters.

On the 1 2th of February 1892 letter cards bearing an 
imprinted penny stamp, and made to be fastened against in- 
spection, were issued to the public at a charge 
of is. for 10 cards. The charge was reduced

'almost at once to 9d. for 8 cards. Similar cards 
have long been in use on the continent of Europe, but they 
do not enjoy much popularity in Great Britain either with 
the post office, which finds them inconvenient to handle in 
sorting and stamping, or with the public. The number issued 
annually is about 10 millions, not counting those of private 
manufacturers.

*Private cards with adhesive stamps first allowed in this year. 

Post cards were first introduced in Austria on the 1st of October 

1869, and were first issued in Great Britain on the istof October 

1870. Only one kind of card was employed, and this was sold 
for one halfpenny; but on the complaints of the stationers, a charge 
of id. per dozen for the material of the card was made in 1872, and 
permission was given for private persons to have their own cards 
stamped at Somerset House. In 1875 a stouter card was^ put on 
sale, and the charges were raised to 7d. per dozen for thin cards 
and 8d. per dozen for stout cards. In 1889 the charges were 
reduced, and they are now sold at 10 for 5id. and 11 for 6d. 
respectively, On the 1st of September 1894, private post cards 
with an adhesive halfpenny stamp were allowed to pass by post, 
and the result has been greatly to diminish the number of cards 
purchased through the post office. It is estimated that 232 out 
of the 400 millions of cards delivered in 1 899-1900 were private 
cards. The sizes of the official cards were again altered in January 
1895 and November 1899. The regulations forbidding anything 
but the address to be written on the address side of a post card 
were made less stringent on the 1st of February 1897; and in 1898 
unpaid post cards, which were previously charged as unpaid letters, 
were allowed to be delivered on payment of double the post card 
rate. These various changes, espe- 
cially the use of the private card and 
the popularity of illustrated post 
cards, have contributed to the rapid 
increase in the number of post cards 
sent by post. Reply post cards were 
first issued on the 1st of October 
1893. Their use has not been exten- 
sive. Only about ij million are 
issued yearly. 

Booh Packets and Samples. — The 
table at foot of page shows the 
estimated number of book packets, 
circulars and samples delivered in 
the United Kingdom, and the in- 
crease per cent, per annum. The 
rate of id. for 2 oz. for the book 
post has remained unaltered since 
the 1st of October 1870. Changes 
have been made in the regulations 
defining the articles which may be 
sent by book post, and prescribing 
the mode of packing them so as 
to admit of easy examination for 



the purpose of detecting letters, &c, sent by the halfpenny post. 
The book post received a great impetus in 1892 (May 28) by the 
permission to enclose book packets in unsealed envelopes. Com- 
plaint is, however, made that such envelopes form a dangerous 
irap for small letters, which are liable to slip inside the flapsof 
open envelopes. But as the rate of postage for articles weighing 
over 2 oz. is now the same for letters and for book packets, 
articles over that weight derive no. advantage from being sent in 
open covers. 

Sample Post. — The sample or pattern post, which was confined 
to bona-fide trade patterns and samples on the 1st of October 1870, 
was then assimilated to the book post (id. for 2 oz.); but the re- 
striction was difficult to enforce and irritating to the public, and the 
sample post was abolished on the 5th of October 1871, when the 
rates of letter postage were lowered. It was re-established on the 

1st of October 1887 (id. for 4 oz. or 
under, and id. for each succeeding 
2 oz.); but when the Jubilee letter 
rates were introduced (June 22, 
1897) it lost its raison d'itre, and 
ceased to exist for inland purposes. 

Newspapers. — The table on 
next page shows the estimated 
number of newspapers delivered 
in the United Kingdom, and the 
increase per cent, per annum. 

The carriage of newspapers by 
the post office does not show the 
same elasticity as other post office 
business. This is due largely to 
the improved system of distri- 
bution adopted by newspaper 
managers and especially to the 
extension of the halfpenny press. 
The practice of posting a news- 
paper after reading it, under a 
co-operative arrangement, has 
practically ceased to exist. The 
carriage of newspapers by post 
is conducted by the post office at a loss. 

It has been frequently stated on behalf of the post office that 
the halfpenny post is unremunerative. Representations are, 
however, made from time'to time in favour of lower Halfpenny 
postage for literature of all kinds. It may therefore ^ st 
be of interest to mention tbat the postmaster- 
general of the United States has, in successive annual reports, 
deplored the effect on the post office service of tbe cheap 
rates for " second-class matter." The cost of carriage over 
so large a territory is heavier than in the United Kingdom; but 
the postmaster-general states that the low rates of postage 
" involve a sheer wanton waste of $20,000,000 or upwards a 
year." Facilities like the extension of free delivery are stifled, 
and the efficiency of the whole service cramped by the loss 
thus sustained. In the United Kingdom the rules respecting the 
halfpenny post were greatly simplified and brought into effect on 
the 1st of October 1906. The halfpenny post can be used only

must not exceed 2 ft., while 1 ft. is the limit in width or depth. 
Any printed or written matter not in the nature of a letter may 
be sent by the halfpenny post, but every packet must be posted 
either without a cover or in an unfastened envelope, or in a 
cover which can be easily removed. The number of halfpenny 
packets delivered in 1906-1907 was 933,200,000.

The inland parcel post began on the 1st of August 1883. No 
parcel might exceed 7 lb in weight, 3! ft. in length, of 6 ft. in 
length and girth combined. The rates were: not 
parcels, exceeding 1 lb, 3d. ; exceeding 1 lb, but not exceeding 
3lb, 6d.; exceeding 3 lb, but not exceeding 5 lb, 9d.; 
exceeding 5 lb, but not exceeding 7 lb, is. The following 
table shows the number of parcels delivered in the United 
Kingdom: —

Arrangements were made with the railway companies, under 
which they receive 55 % of the postage on each parcel sent by 
train. This arrangement, which was to hold good for 21 years, 
proved, however, an onerous one, and on the 1st of June 1887 
the post office started a parcel coach between London and Brighton. 
The coach, replaced in 1905 by a motor van, travelled by night, 
and reached Brighton in time for the first delivery. The experi- 
ment proving successful, other coach and motor services^ were 
started at different dates between London and other places in the 
provinces, the mail services performed by motor vans amounting 
in 1906 to nearly forty. Nearly n J millions of parcels were con- 
veyed by the post office in 1900-190 1 without passing over a 
railway. 

On the 1st of May 1896, the maximum weight was increased 
to 11 lb, and the postage rates were reduced: not exceeding 1 lb, 
3d.; for each succeeding lb, ijd.; the charge for a parcel of 11 lb 
was thus is. 6d. New rates were subsequently introduced and 
the rates for parcels now are : not exceeding 1 lb, 3d. ; 2 lb, 4d. ; 
3 lb, 5d; 5 lb, 6d.; 7 lb, 7d.; for each succeeding ft up to 11 lb, 
id. The length of a parcel must not exceed 3 ft. 6 in.; length and 
girth combined must not exceed 6 ft. By the Post Office (Literature 
for the Blind) Act 1906, the postage on packets of papers and books 
impressed for the use of the blind was greatly reduced, the rates 
being fixed at: not exceeding 2 oz., £d. ; exceeding 2 oz. and not 
exceeding 2 lb, id.; not exceeding 5 lb, i£d.; not exceeding 6 lb, 
2jd. 

The number of letters registered by the public in the United 
Kingdom in 1 884-1 885 amounted to 11,365,151. In the next 

ten years the numbers oscillated between 10,779,555 
LetttrT d (1886-1887) and 12,132,144 (1892-1893); but since 

1894-1895, when 11,958,264 letters were registered, 
the number steadily increased, until it stood at 19,029,114 for 
1 903-1 904. It decreased, however, 2-8% in 1 904-1 905, in- 
increased -7 in the following year, but declined again by -8% in 
1 906-1 907. It has been surmised 2 that the introduction of

postal orders checked the growth of registered letters for 
some years after 1880. In 1886 a system of insurance for 
registered letters was adopted. The ordinary registration fee 
entitled the owner, in case of loss, to recover compensation from 
the post office up to a limit of £2. For an additional insurance 
fee of id. the limit was raised to £5, and for 2d. to £10. Various 
changes have since been made, and the separate insurance system 

has been abolished. At present 
a registration fee of 2d. entitles to 
compensation up to £5, 3d. £20, 
and each additional penny to a 
further £20, up to a maximum 
of £400. The system of registra- 
tion has also been extended to 
parcels. 

On the 1 st of February 1891 
the railway letter service came 
into operation. At 
passenger stations on Letters 
the principal railways 
a letter not exceeding 4 oz. in 
weight may be handed in at the 
booking office for conveyance by 
the next train. A fee of 2d. is 
payable to the railway company as 
well as the ordinary postage of id. 
The letter may be addressed to a railway station to be called 
for. If it bears any other address it is posted on arrival at 
its proper station. The number of packets so sent is about 
200,000 a year. 

The express* deli very service dates from the 25th of March 
1 89 1. A private company formed for the purpose of supplying 
the public on demand with an express messenger 
to execute errands was found to be infringing the 
postmaster-general's monopoly both as regards 
the conveyance of letters and the transmission of communi- 
cations by electricity. The services of the company were, 
however, much appreciated by the public. The government 
accordingly authorized the post office to license the existing 
company to continue its business, on the payment of royalties, 
till 1903,* and to start an express service of its own. 

Messengers can be summoned from the post office by telephone, 
and arrangements can be made with the post office for the special 
delivery of all packets arriving by particular mails in advance of 
the ordinary postman. The sender of a packet may have it con- 
veyed by express messenger all the way, or may direct that, after 
conveyance by ordinary post to the terminal post office, it shall 
then be delivered by special messenger. The fees, in addition to 
ordinary postage, were originally fixed at 2d. for the first mile, 
3d. for the second mile, and is. a mile.additional when the distance 
exceeded 2 m. and there was no "public conveyance. Under 
the present regulations the fee is 3d. for each mile covered by 
special messenger before delivery. No charge is made for post- 
age in respect of the special service, but if the packet is very 
weighty or the distance considerable, and no public conveyance 
is available, the sender must pay for a cab or other special 
conveyance. 

Letters and parcels to or from a number of foreign countries 
and colonies may also be marked for express delivery after trans- 
mission by post; and residents in London, not having a delivery 
of ordinary letters on Sunday, may receive on that day express 
letters from home or abroad which have come to hand too late 
for express delivery on Saturday nights. The total number of 
express services in 1905-1906 was i,578»74 6 - 1" many cases one 
of these services included the delivery of batches of letters, so that 
in London alone 1,010,815 express services were performed, in- 
cluding 47,601 deliveries in advance of the postmen. 

There are various central dep6ts for dealing with " dead " or 
returned letters. The principal office is in London, In the 
year 1905-1906 10,868,272 letters were received at Returoea 
the various returned letter offices, of which 1,008,017 betters. 
could neither be delivered to the addresses nor re- 
turned to the senders. Such of these as contain nothing of 
value are at once destroyed, and no record of them is kept. The

others are recorded, and (if not previously claimed by the owners) 
their contents are sold by auction at intervals. If the owner 
applies after the sale, the proceeds are handed over to him. In 
addition to these 10 millions of letters, there were many others 
disposed of at head post offices, whence they were returned 
direct and unopened to the senders, whose names and addresses 
appeared on the outside of the letters. The total number of 
post cards received in the various offices as undelivered was

and parcels,* 248,526; 195,145 of these last were re-issued. 
Articles sent by the halfpenny post are destroyed at the head 
offices if they cannot be delivered; but the sender may have 
such articles returned if he writes a request to that effect on 
the outside of the packet, together with his name and address, 
and pays a second postage on the return of the packet. The 
number of registered letters and letters containing property 
sent through the post with insufficient addresses was 320,041. 
These letters contained £16,887 in cash and bank-notes, and 
£656,845 in bills, cheques, money orders, postal orders and 
stamps. The coin found loose in the post amounted to 
£1,380, as well as £12,272 in cheques and other forms of remit- 
tance. 

The table in opposite column shows the estimated weight of 
the mails (excluding parcels) exchanged with the 
British colonies and foreign countries in 1 905-1 906. aum^* 
The number of letters and post cards may be roughly 
taken at 40 to the lb. 

During the same year 2,474,003 parcels were despatched out 
of the United Kingdom, and 1,431,035 were received from the 
British colonies and other countries. Germany, with 356,423, 
received the largest number of any one country, and easily 
heads the list of countries from which parcels were imported 
into the United Kingdom, with 474,669, France coming next 
with 254,490. 

On the 1st of January 1889 a weekly all-sea service to the 
Australasian colonies was opened. The rates were 4d. per 
4 oz. for letters, and 2d. for post cards, as compared pq^/^ and 
with 6d. and 3d. by the quicker route. In the Budget Colonial 
of 1890 provision was made for a lower and uniform Letter 
rate of postage from the United Kingdom to India ^ a ' e5 * 
and the British colonies generally. The rates, which had hitherto 
varied from 2^d. to 4d., sd., or 6d. per \ oz., were fixed at 2$d. 
per i oz. The change took effect on the 1st of January 1891, 
and resulted at the outset in a loss of £100,000 a year. The 
fourth postal union congress, which met at Vienna in May and 
June 1 891 (third congress at Lisbon, February and March 1885), 
took a further step in the direction of uniformity, and on the 
1 st of October 1891 the 2§d. rate was extended to foreign 
as well as colonial letters from the United Kingdom. The 
Australasian colonies gave their adhesion to the Union at this 
congress, and the Cape signified its adhesion at the next congress 
(Washington, May and June 1897), while British Bechuanaland 
and Rhodesia entered in 1900, and the whole of the British 
Empire is now included in the international union. Abyssinia, 
Afghanistan, Arabia, China and Morocco are the chief countries 
which remain outside. The rate was 2?d. the first oz., and ijd. 
per oz. afterwards. 

Advantage was taken of the presence in England of special 
representatives of India and the principal British colonies 
to hold an imperial postal conference in London 
in June and July 1897, under the presidency of the ^^jjjj^ 
duke of Norfolk, postmaster-general. Chiefly at 
the instance of Canada the duke announced that on and from 
Christmas Day 1898 an imperial penny post would be estab- 
lished with such of the British colonies as were prepared to 
reciprocate. The new rates (id. per £ oz.), which had long been 
advocated by Mr Henniker Heaton, were adopted then or shortly 
afterwards by the countries within the empire, with the ex- 
ceptions of Australasia and the Cape, where the 2jd. rate re- 
mained unaltered. The Cape came afterwards into the scheme, 
and New Zealand joined in 1002. Australia did not see its 
way to make the necessary financial arrangements, but in 1905 
agreed to receive without surcharge letters from other parts of 
the empire prepaid at id. per J oz. and reduced its outward 
postage to 2d. per \ oz., raised to 1 oz. in 1907. In 191 1 
penny postage was adopted throughout the commonwealth and 
to the United Kingdom. Owing to the special relations existing 
between the governments of Egypt and the United Kingdom, 
penny postage for letters passing between the United Kingdom 
and Egypt and the Sudan was introduced in December 1005; and 



i86 



POST, AND POSTAL SERVICE 



the Egyptian post office subsequently arranged for. f the adoption 
of this rate with many of the British colonies. On the ist of 
October 1908 penny postage was established between Great 
Britain and the United States on the same lines as the imperial 
penny post. 

At the 1897 conference it was proposed that the parcel rates 
with British possessions should be lowered and simplified by the 
adoption of a triple scale for parcels exchanged by sea, namely, 
is. up to 3 lb, 2s. from 3 to 7 lb, and 3s. from 7 to 11 lb. This 
scale has been adopted by many of the British colonies. The parcel 
post has been gradually extended to nearly the whole civilized 
world, while the rates have in many cases been considerably re- 
duced. The United States remained an exception, and in 1902 
an agreement was concluded with the American Express Company 
for a parcel service. In April 1904 an official service was estab- 
lished with the United States post office, but the semi-official 
service is still maintained with the American Express Company. 
By the official service the limit of weight was 4 lb 6 oz., and the 
postage 2s. per parcel; by the semi-official service parcels up to 
11 lb in weight may be sent, the rates ranging from 3s. to 6s. 
On the ist of July 1908 the rates were revised. The limit of weight 
was increased to 1 1 lb, the rate for a parcel being is. 6d. for a parcel 
up to 3 lb in weight, 2s. 6d. up to 7 lb, 3s. 6d. up to 9 it) and 
4s. 6d. for 11 lb. 

On the ist of January 1885 the post office at Malta was 
transferred from the control of H.M. postmaster-general to that 
of the local administration, and a similar change was made 
as regards Gibraltar on the ist of June 1896. 

Remarkable improvements have been effected in the speed 
and frequency of the mails sent abroad, and contracts are 
Foreign entered into from time to time with the various 
Matt mail steamship companies for additional or improved 

Service. services. The transit charges for special trains 
conveying mails through France and Italy for Egypt, 
India, Australia and the Far East have been successively 
reduced until they now stand at the ordinary Postal Union 
transit rates. 

Mention should be made of the Army post office, which is 
now an essential accompaniment of military operations. On 
Army Post the outbreak of hostilities in South Africa in 1899, 
Office tbe British post office supplied 10 officers and 392 
Corps. men t0 ^aj ^k ^e mails of the forces, sell postage 
stamps, deal in postal orders, &c. Contingents were also 
sent by the Canadian, Australian, and Indian post offices. 
Including telegraphists and men of the army reserve, 3400 
post office servants were sent to the front. 

Money Order Department 

The money order branch of the post office dates from 1792. 1 
It was begun with the special object of facilitating the safe 
Money conveyance of small sums to soldiers and sailors, 
Orders. tfe thefts of letters containing money being fre- 
quent. Two schemes were put forward, one similar to the 
present money order system. There were doubts whether 
the post office had power to adopt the system, and it was not 
officially taken up. Six officers of the post office, however, called 
the " clerks of the roads," who were already conducting a large 
newspaper business with profit to themselves, came forward 
with a plan, which was encouraged by the postmaster-general, 
who also bore the cost of advertising it, and even allowed the 
advices of the money orders to go free by post under the " frank " 
of the secretary to the post office. In 1798 the clerks of the 
roads gave up the scheme, and three post office clerks known as 
" Stow and Company " took it over. The death of Stow in 
1836 left one sole proprietor who had a capital of £2000 embarked 
in the concern. In 1838 the government determined to take 
over the business and compensated the proprietor with an 
allowance of over £400 a year. The rates of commission fixed 
by the government were is. 6d. for sums exceeding £2 and under 
£5, and 6d. for all sums not exceeding £2. In 1840 these 
rates were reduced to 6d. and 3d. respectively. The number 
and aggregate amount of the orders issued (inland, colonial and

The decrease in the number of inland money orders till 
1890-1891 was due to the competition of postal orders, and to 
the reduction (Jan. 1, 1878) of the charge for registering a 
letter from 4d. to 2d. 2 

In 1862 the issue of orders for larger sums was allowed: not 
exceeding £7, 9d.; not exceeding £10, is. 

On tr>e ist of May 1871 a scale of charges was fixed as follows: 
orders not exceeding 10s., id.; not exceeding £1, 2d.; not exceeding 
£2, 3d.; and so on, an additional penny being charged per £. For 
sums of £10 the rate was is. It was found, however, that the low 
rate of id. for small orders did not provide a profit, and the rates 
were raised on the 1st of January 1878 to: orders not exceeding 
ios., 2d.; not exceeding £2, 3d. On the ist of September 1886 the 
rates were altered as follows: orders not exceeding £1, 2d.; not 
exceeding £2, 3d.; not exceeding £4, 4d.; not exceeding £7, 5 d.; 
not exceeding £10, 6d. On the ist of February 1897 new rates 
were introduced; on orders not exceeding £3, 3d.; over £3 and not 
exceeding £io, 40*. 

The cost of a money order transaction (at least 3d.) is very 
little affected by the amount of the remittance, and it was 
thought undesirable to continue the unremunerative business 
of sending small sums by money order at less tban cost price 
at the expense of the senders of larger orders. The needs of 
smaller remitters appeared to be sufficiently met by postal 
orders and the registered letter post. It appeared, however, 
that the new charges fell with great severity upon mutual 
benefit societies, like the Hearts of Oak, which sent large num- 
bers of small money orders every week, and on the ist of May 
1897 the 2d. rate was restored for orders not exceeding £1. This 
society and others now use postal orders instead of money orders. 
In 1905 the limit for money orders was extended to £40, and the 
rates are: sums over £10 and not exceeding £20, 6d.; sums 
over £20 and not exceeding £30, 8d.; sums over £30 and not 
exceeding £40, iod. 

Money orders may be sent to almost any country in the world. 
The ra*tes are as follows: for sums not exceeding £1, 3d.; „ 
£2 64; £4, 94; £6, if; flu 3d.; £», is. 64; % > Z'%? ad 
and for countries on which orders may be issued for r" iua "" 
higher amounts (limit £40), 3d. for every additional n°£!Z 
£2 or fraction of £2. oraers. 

The money order system is largely used by the British govern- 
ment departments for the payment of pensions, separation allow- 
ances, remittance of bankruptcy dividends, &c. ; and free orders 
may be obtained by the public, under certain conditions, for the 
purpose of remitting their taxes. The cost of management of the 
money order office was reduced by the substitution, since 1898, 
of a number of women clerks for men and boys. 

On the 2nd of September 1889 the issue of telegraphic money 
orders between London and seventeen large towns was begun as an 
experiment, and on the ist of March 1890 the system 
was extended to all head post offices, and branch offices T * le 2 ra P h 
in the United Kingdom. Two years later it was ex- a°? ey 
tended to every office which transacts both money order Vnters * 
and telegraph business. The rates, which have been several times 
revised, are (1) a poundage at the ordinary rate for inland money 
orders, (2) a charge for the official telegram of advice to the office 
of payment at the ordinary rate for inland telegrams, the minimum 
being 6d., and (3) a supplementary fee of 2d. for each order. The 
sender of a telegraph money order may give instructions that, 
instead of being left at the post office to be called for, it should 
be delivered at the payee's residence, and that it should be crossed

showing that the small orders alone were effected. The average 
amount for ordinary inland orders is now £2, 19s. 5d.

The telegraph inland money orders in 1905-1906 amounted to 
503,543. and the sums so remitted to £1,646,882, an average of 
£3, is. The number of telegraph money order transactions between 
the United Kingdom and foreign countries amounted to 18,787, 
representing £139,402. 

Postal orders were first issued on the 1st of January 188 1. 
For some years before that date postmasters-general had con-

Orders. amounts at a small commission to replace money 
orders for sums under 20s., which had failed to be 
remunerative. When the plan was submitted to a committee 
appointed by the treasury, it was* objected that postal orders 
as remitting media would be less secure than money orders. 
This was met in part by giving a discretionary power to fill in 
the name of the post office and also of the payee. Another 
objection which was urged, namely, that they would prove to 
be an issue of government small notes under another name, was 
quickly disproved. Parliament sanctioned the scheme in 1880.

In 1884 a new series was issued and a provision made that 
broken amounts might be made up by affixing postage stamps, to 
the value of 5d., to the orders. Postal orders have become 
increasingly popular as a means of remitting small amounts, 
especially since the introduction in 1903 of new denominations, 
rendering it possible to obtain a postal order for every complete 
sixpence from 6d. to 21s. From 6d. to 2s. 6d. the poundage 
is id., from 3s. to 15s., id., from 15s. 6d. up to 21s., i§d. Postal 
orders are also furnished with counterfoils, as a means of keeping 
a record of the number and amount of each order posted. Orders 
for amounts of ios. and upwards are printed in red ink. A 
system of interchange of postal orders between the United 
Kingdom and India and the British colonies, and also between 
one colony and another, has been instituted. British postal 
orders are obtainable also at post offices- in Panama, Constan- 
tinople, Salonica and Smyrna, and on H.M. ships. The fol- 
lowing table shows the number and value of postal orders issued

It remains to be added that the various statutes relating to 
the post office', except those relating to telegraphs and the car- 
riage of mails, were consolidated by the Post Office Act 1908. 
The act repealed and superseded 26 acts wholly and 10 acts 
in parts. Sections 1-11 deal with the duties 'of postage; §§ 
12-19 trith the conditions of transit of postal packets; §§ 20-22 
with newspapers; §§ 23-25 with money orders; §§26-32 with 
ship letters; §§ 33-44 with the postmaster-general and officers; 
§§ 45-47 with the holding, &c, of land; §§ 48-49 with the 
extension of postal facilities and accommodation; §§ 50-69 
with post office offences; §§ 70-78 with legal proceedings, and 
§§ 79-94 with regulations, definitions, &c. 



Savings Banks. 1 
^The establishment of post office savings banks was prac- 
tically suggested in the year i860 by Charles William Sykes of 
Huddersfield, whose suggestion was cordially re- 
ceived by W. E. Gladstone, then chancellor of the j^S!* 
exchequer, to whose conspicuous exertions in par- 
liament the effectual working-out of the measure and also many 
and great improvements in its details arc due. Half a century 
earlier (1807) it had been proposed to utilize the then existing 
and rudimentary money order branch of the post office for the 
collection and transmission of savings from all parts of the coun- 
try to a central savings bank to be established in London. A 
bill to that effect was brought into the House of Commons by 
S. Whitbread, but it failed to receive adequate support, and was 
withdrawn. When Sykes revived the proposal of 1807 the 
number of savings banks managed by trustees was 638, but of 
these about 350 were open only for a few hours on a single day 
of the week. Only twenty throughout the kingdom were open 
daily. Twenty-four towns containing upwards of ten thousand 
inhabitants each were without any savings bank. Fourteen 
counties were without any. In the existing banks the average 
amount of a deposit was £4, 6s. $d. 

Gladstone's Bill, entitled " An Act to grant additional 
facilities for depositing small savings at interest, with the 
security of Government for the due repayment thereof, " be- 
came law on the 17th of May 1861, and was brought into opera- 
tion on the 1 6th of September following. The banks first opened 
were in places theretofore unprovided. In February 1862 the 
act was brought into operation in Scotland and in Ireland. 
Within two years nearly all the money order offices of the 
United Kingdom became savings banks, and the expansion 
of the business was continual. The growth of business is shown 
in the following table: —

The code of the 1st of November 1888 did not enlarge the 
limits of deposits or make any great and conspicuous change 
in the general system, but the postmaster-general obtained 
power to offer certain facilities for the transfer of money from 
one account to another, for the easier disposal of the funds of 
deceased depositors by means of nominations, and in various 
ways for the convenience of the customers of the bank. Arrange- 
ments were made; for reducing to is. the cost of certificates of 
births, deaths and marriages required for savings bank pur- 
poses. In July 1889 Local Loans 3% Stock was made available 
for purchase through the post office savings bank. 

" In July 1891," says the report of the postmaster-general in 
1897, u another Act of Parliament was passed by which the maxi- 
mum amount which might be deposited was raised from £150 to 
£200^ inclusive of interest. The annual limit remained at £30, 
but it was provided that, irrespective of that limit, depositors 
might # replace in the bank the^ amount of any one withdrawal 
made in the same year. The object of this provision was to avoid 
curtailing the saving power of a person who might be driven by 
emergency to make an inroad upon his store, but who might never- 
theless, when the emergency had passed, find himself none the 
poorer and able to replace the money withdrawn. 

11 The act provided also that where on any account the principal 
and interest together exceeded £200, interest should cease only on 
the amount in excess of £200, whereas previously interest ceased 
altogether when it had brought the balance of an account up to 
£200. 

11 The next striking development of the Savings Bank arose out 
of the Free Education Act, passed in September 1891. The

POST, AND POSTAL SERVICE 



government of the day desired that advantage should be taken 
of the opportunity to inculcate upon parents and children alike 
a lesson of thrift — that they should save the school pence which 
they were no longer bound to pay. The Education Department 
and the postmaster-general worked in concert to realize this end. 
School managers were urged to press the matter upon all concerned, 
special stamp slips were prepared and issued, managers were 
supplied on credit with stocks of stamps to be sold to the children, 
and clerks from the nearest post offices attended at schools to open 
accounts and receive deposits. The arrangement began in January 
1892; about 1400 schools adopted the scheme at once, and three 
years later this number had risen to 3000. A sum of nearly £14,000 
was estimated to have been deposited in schools in 5 months, and 
about £40,000 in the first year. Concurrently with the spread of 
the stamp-slip system in the schools, the extension of School Penny 
Banks, connected intimately with the Savings Bank, was a con- 
spicuous result of the effort to turn into profitable channels the 
pence which no longer paid school fees. 

"In December 1893 another Act of Parliament extended the 
annual limits of deposits from £30 to £50. The maximum of £200 
remained unchanged, but it was piovided that any accumulations 
accruing after that amount had been reached should be invested 
in government stock unless the depositor gave instructions to the 
contrary. 

"In December 1893 arrangements were made for the use of the 
telegraph for the withdrawal of money from the savings bank. 
Postmasters-general had hesitated long before sanctioning this 
new departure. It was known that the system was in force abroad, 
and it was recognized that there might be, and doubtless were, 
cases in the United Kingdom where the possibility of withdrawing 
money without delay might be all-important, and might save a 
depositor from debt and distress. But, on the other hand, it was 
strongly^ held that the cause of thrift was sometimes served by 
interposing a delay between a sudden desire to spend and its 
realization ; and it was also held to be essential to maintain a marked 
distinction between a bank of deposit for savings and a bank for 
keeping current accounts." 

On the whole, the balance of opinion was in favour of the 
change, and two new methods of withdrawal were provided. A 
depositor might telegraph for his money and have his warrant 
sent to him by return of post, or he might telegraph for his money 
and have it paid to him in an hour or two on the authority of a 
telegram from the savings bank to the postmaster. The first 
method cost the depositor about 9d., the second cost him about 
is. 3d. for the transaction. On the 3rd of July 1905 a new sys- 
tem of withdrawal was instituted, under which a depositor, on 
presentation of his book at any post office open for savings hank 
business, can withdraw immediately any sum not exceeding 
£1. Depositors have availed themselves extensively of this 
system. During 1906, 4,758,440 withdrawals, considerably more 
than one-half of the total number of withdrawals, were made "on 
demand," and as a consequence the number of withdrawals 
made by telegraph fell to 122,802, against 168,036 in the pre- 
vious year (during only half of which the " on demand " system 
was in force). 

By an act which came into force on the 1st of January 1895 
building societies, duly incorporated, were enabled to deposit 
at* any one time a sum not exceeding £300, and to buy 
government stock up to £500 through the savings bank. 

Savings Bank Finance. — The increase in the deposits lodged in 
the post office savings bank must be ascribed to a variety of 
causes. Numbers of trustee banks have been closed, and have 
transferred their accounts to the post office bank; greater facilities 
have been offered by the bank; the limits of deposit in one year, 
and of total deposit, have been raised; and, since October 1892, 
deposits may be made by cheque; while the long-continued fall in 
the rate of interest made the assured 2j% of the post office savings 
bank an increasing temptation to a class of investors previously 
accustomed to look elsewhere. The high price of consols, due in 
part to the magnitude of purchases on savings bank account, 
proved a serious embarrassment to the profitable working of the 
bank, which had shown a balance of earnings on each year's work- 
ing until 1896, after > paying its expenses and i\% interest to its 
depositors. Economical working minimized, but did not remove 
the difficulty. The average cost of each transaction, originally 
nearly 7d., has been brought down to 5fd. Down to the year 
1896, £1,598,767 was paid into the exchequer under § 14 of the 
Act 40 Vict. c. 13, being the excess of interest which had accrued 
year by year. But since 1895 there have been deficits in each year, 
and in 1905, owing principally tc the reduced rate on consols, the 
expenditure exceeded the income by £88,094. ' • 

The central savings bank having outgrown its accommo- 
dation in Queen Victoria Street, London, a new site was 



purchased in 1898 for £45,000 at West Kensington, and the 
foundation-stone of a new building, costing £300,000, was laid by 
the prince of Wales on the 24th of June 1899. The entire 
removal of the business was carried out in 1903. 

Under the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897, sums 
awarded as compensation might be invested in the post office 
savings bank. This arrangement proved so convenient that 
an act of 1900 authorized a similar investment of money paid 
into an English county court in ordinary actions at common 
law, and ordered to be invested for the benefit of an infant or 
lunatic. In 1906 a committee was appointed to go into the 
question as to whether the post office should provide facilities 
for the insurance of employers in respect of liabilities under the 
Workmen's Compensation Acts, but no scheme was recom- 
mended involving post office action either as principal or agent. 
Post offices, however, exhibit notices drawing attention to the 
liabilities imposed by the act of 1906, and sub-postmasters are 
encouraged to accept agencies in their private capacity for 
insurance companies undertaking this class of insurance. 

Inducements to Thrift. — By arrangement with the war office 
in July 1893, the deferred pay of soldiers leaving the army was 
invested on their behalf in the post office savings bank, but it 
was found that the majority of the soldiers draw out practically 
the whole amount at once, and the experiment was discontinued 
in 1901^ At the request of large employers of labour, an officer of 
the savings bank attends at industrial establishments on days 
when^ wages are paid, and large numbers of workmen have thus 
been induced to become depositors. The advantages of the savings 
bank appear to be now thoroughly appreciated throughout the 
United Kingdom, as shown by the following table: —

Between the foundation of the bank and the end of 1899, upwards 
of £648,000,000, inclusive of interest, was credited to depositors, 
of which £474,000,000 was withdrawn. There were 232,634,596 
deposits, 81,804,509 withdrawals, 27,071,556 accounts opened, 
and 18,631,573 accounts closed. The cross-entries, or instances 
where the account is operated upon at a different office from that 
at which it was opened, amounted to 33%. It is chiefly in respect 
of this facility that the post office savings bank enjoys its advan- 
tage over the trustee savings bank. In 1965, 16,320,204 deposits 
were made, amounting to £42,300,617. In the same year the with- 
drawals numbered 7,155,283, the total sum withdrawn being 
£42,096,037. The interest credited to depositors was £3,567,206, 
and the total sum standing to their credit on the 31st of December 
1900 was £152,111,140. 

A classification of accounts opened for 3 months in 1896, and 
assumed to be fairly typical, showed the following results: —

Investments in Government Stock, — In September 1888 the mini- 
mum amount of government stock which might be purchased 
or sold through the post office savings bank was reduced from 
£10 to is., and it was also provided that any person who had 
purchased stock through the savings bank could, if he so desired, 
have it transferred to his own name in the books of the Bank of 
England. The act of 1893 raised the limit of stock to £200 in one 
year, and £500 in all; but anjr depositor^ might purchase stock, to 
replace stock previously sold, in one entire sum during that year. 
If a depositor exceeds the authorized limits of deposit in the post 
office savings bank, the excess is invested in stock by the post 
office on his behalf. The investments of depositors in government 
stock, however, have a tendency to decrease, and the sales, on the 
other hand, to increase, as will be seen from the following table: —

Annuities and Life Insurances, — The act of 1882, which came 
into operation on the 3rd of June 1884, utilized the machinery 
of the post office savings bank for annuities and life insurances, 
which had been effected through the post office at selected towns 
in England and Wales since the 17th of April 1865. Under the 
act of 1882 all payments were to be made by means of money 
deposited in the savings bank, and an order could be given by a 
depositor that any sum — even to id. a week — should be devoted 
to the purchase of an annuity or insurance so long as he retained 
a balance in the savings bank. In February 1896 new life insur- 
ance tables came into operation, with reduced annual rates, and with 
provision for payment of sums insured at various ages as desired. 
The following table shows the business done from 1901 to 1905 



additional five words, the addresses of sender and receiver being 
sent free. In 1885 the charge was reduced to a halfpenny a 
word throughout, including addresses (a system of abbreviated 
addresses, which could be registered on payment of a guinea a 
year, being introduced), with a minimum charge of sixpence. 
To obviate the damage and interruption resulting from storms 
large numbers of wires have been laid underground. 

In 1891 the terms under which a new telegraph office was opened, 
on the request of a person or persons who undertook to guarantee 
the post office against loss, were reduced. In 1892 rural sanitary 
authorities were empowered to give such guarantees out of the 
rates. In 1897, as part of the Jubilee concessions, the government 
undertook to pay one-half of any deficiency under guarantees. 
During the six years ended in 1891 the average number of telegraph 
offices guaranteed each year was 77. From 1892 to 1897 the 
average rose to 167. In 1905 and 10J06 it amounted to 152. The 
number of telegraph offices opened without guarantee has increased 
apace, and there are now 12,993 telegraph offices in all. As part 
of the Jubilee scheme the charges for porterage were reduced as 
follows: Up to 3 miles free; beyond 3 m. f 3d. per m., reckoned from 
the post office; and arrangements were made for the free delivery 
at all hours of the day or night of any telegram within the metro- 
politan postal district. The cost of free delivery up to 3 m. was 
estimated at £52,000 a year. 

Foreign Telegrams, — The sixth international telegraph 
conference, held at Berlin in 1884, effected a reduction in the 
charges to many countries. E.g. the rate per 
word was reduced for Russia from od. to 6£d., 
Spain 6d. to 4$d., Italy $d. to 4^d., and India 
4s. 7d. to 4s. The cost of repeating a message 
was reduced from one-half to one-fourth of the 
original charge for transmission. At the next con- 
ference (1890) held at Paris, further considerable 
reductions were effected. The rates to Austria- 
Hungary and Italy were reduced from 4^d. to 3d., 
Russia 6£d. to 5^d., Portugal 5$d. to 42*!., Sweden 
5d. to 4d.j Spain 4$d. to 4d., Canary Islands is. 7$d. to is., &c. 
The minimum charge "for any foreign (European) telegram was 
fixed at iod. The eighth conference (Budapest, 1896) succeeded in 
making the following reductions, among others, from the United 
Kingdom: China 7s. to 5s. 6d., Java 6s. to 5s., Japan 8s. to 
6s. 2d., Mauritius 8s. 9d. to 5s., Persia 2s. 5d. to is. 9d. At this 
conference it was made incumbent upon every state adher- 
ing to the union to fix in its currency an equivalent approaching 
as nearly as possible the standard rate in gold, and to correct 
and declare the equivalent in case of any important fluctuation.

Telegraphs and Telephones 

The history of the development of telegraphy and the early 

proposals for the transference to the state of the telegraph 

monopoly will be found in the article Telegraphy. 

Telegraphs. Qn the ^ of February lSyQ the Telegraph Act 

of the previous year took effect. The post office assumed 
control of telegraphic communication within the United King- 
dom, and it became possible to send telegrams throughout 
the country at a uniform charge irrespective of locality or dis- 
tance. In 1885 sixpenny telegrams were introduced. The 
charge for a written telegram which came into force in 1870 was 
one shilling for the first twenty words, and threepence for every 



The limit of letters in one word of plain language was raised 
from 10 to 15, and the number of figures from 3 to 5. The 
International Telegraph Bureau was also ordered to compile 
an enlarged official vocabulary of code words, which it is 
proposed to recognize as the sole authority for words which 
may be used in cypher telegrams sent by the public. (See 
Appendix to Posimaster-GencraTs Report, 1897.) See further 
Telegraph. 

Ten years of state administration of the telegraphs had not 
passed before the postmaster-general was threatened with a 
formidable rival in the form of the telephone, which T bQoes 
assumed a practical shape about the year 1878, the * ep 
first exchange in the United Kingdom being established in

Post Office Staff 
The staff of the post office on the 31st of March 1906 amounted 
to 195,432. Of these 41,081 were women, a proportion of over 
one-fifth of the staff. The postmasters numbered 875 (in- 
cluding 10 employed abroad), and the sub-postmasters 21,027. 



preference was given to army, navy and royal marine pensioners, 
and men of the army reserve. Due regard was paid to the legitimate 
claims of telegraph messengers or other persons who had prospects 
of succeeding to these situations. In August 1897 the government 
decided to reserve one-half of all suitable vacancies for ex-soldiers 
and sailors, as postmen, porters and labourers, and preference 
has been shown to them for employment as lift-attendants, care- 
takers, &c.

The total number of offices (including branch offices) was 22,088. 
The unestablished staff, not entitled to pension, made up chiefly 
of telegraph boys, and of persons who are employed for only 
part of the day on post office business, included 87,753 out of 
the grand total, and almost the whole of the sub-postmasters. 
The pay and prospects of almost all classes have been greatly 
improved since 1884, when the number stood at 01,184. The 
principal schemes of general revision of pay have been: 1881, 
Fawcett's scheme for sorting-clerks, sorters and telegraphists 
(additional cost £210,000 a year), and for postmen, 1882, 
£110,000: Raikes's various revisions, 1888, chief clerks and 
supervising officers, £6230; 1890, sorting-clerks, sorters and 
telegraphists, £179,600; 1890, supervising force, £65,000; 

1890, London sorters, £20,700; 1891, London overseers, £9400; 

1891, postmen, £125,650: Arnold Morley, 1884, London 
overseers, £1400, and rural auxiliaries, £20,000. 

A committee was appointed in June 1895 with Lord Twcedmouth 
as chairman, to consider the pay and position of the post office 
staff, excluding the clerical force and those employed at head- 
quarters. The committee reported on the 15th of December 1896 and 
its recommendations were adopted at an immediate increased ex- 
pense of £139,000 a year, which. has since risen to £500,000. In 
1897 additional concessions were made at a cost of £100,000 a year. 

In July 1890 a number of postmen in London went out on 
strike. Over 450 were dismissed in one morning, and the work 
of the post office was carried on without interruption. The 
men received no sympathy from the public, and most of them 
were ultimately successful in their plea to be reinstated. A 
quasi-political agitation was carried on during the general elec- 
tion of 1892 by some of the London sorters, who, under the plea 
of civil rights, claimed the right to influence candidates for 
parliament by exacting pledges for the promise of parliamentary 
support. The leaders were dismissed, and the post office has 
upheld the principle that its officers are to hold themselves free 
to serve either party in the State without putting themselves 
prominently forward as political partisans. Parliament has 
been repeatedly asked to sanction a parliamentary inquiry to 
reopen the settlement of the Tweedmouth Committee, and 
the telegraphists have been especially active in pressing for 
a further committee. The rates of pay at various dates since 
1 881 are set out with great fullness in the Parliamentary papers 
(Postmen 7 No. 237 of 1897; Sorters, Telegraphists, cVc, No. 230 
of 1898. and Report of the Select Committee on Post Office Servants, 
1907; tnis latter contains important recommendations for the 
removal of many grievances which the staff had been long 
agitating to have removed). 

In November 1891 an important change was made in the method 
of recruiting postmen, with the object of encouraging military 
service, and providing situations for those who after serving in the 
army or navy are left without employment at a comparatively 
early age. In making appointments to the situation of postman, 



Postage Stamps 

For all practical purposes the history of postage stamps begins 
in the United Kingdom. A post-paid envelope was in common 
use in Paris in the year 1653. Stamped postal letter-paper 
(carta postale bollata) was issued to the public by the govern- 
ment of the Sardinian States in November 1818, and stamped 
postal envelopes were issued by the same government from 
1820 until 1836. 1 Stamped wrappers for newspapers were made 
experimentally in London by Charles Whiting, under the name 
of "go-frees," in 1830. Four years later (June 1834), and in 
ignorance of what Whiting had already done, Charles Knight, 
the well-known publisher, in a letter addressed to Lord Althorp, 
then chancellor of the exchequer, recommended similar wrappers 
for adoption. From this suggestion apparently Rowland Hill, 
who is justly regarded as the originator of postage stamps, got 
his idea. Meanwhile, however, the adhesive stamp was made 
experimentally by James Chalmers in his printing-office at 
Dundee in August 1834. 2 These experimental stamps were 
printed from ordinary type, and were made adhesive by a wash 
of gum. Chalmers had already won local distinction by his 
successful efforts in 1822, for the acceleration of the Scottish 
mails from London. Those efforts" resulted in a saving of 
forty-eight hours on the double mail journey, and were highly 
appreciated in Scotland. 

Rowland Hill brought the adhesive stamp under the notice of 
the commissioners of post office inquiry on the 13th of February 
1837. Chalmers made no public mention of his stamp of 1834 
until November 1837. 

Rowland Hill's pamphlet led to the appointment of a com- 
mittee of the House of Commons on the 22nd of November 
1837, " to inquire into the rates and modes of charging postage, 
with a view to such a reduction thereof as may be made without 
injury to the revenue." This committee reported in favour 
of Hill's proposals; and an act was passed in 1839, authorizing 
the treasury to fix the rates of postage, and regulate the mode 
of their collection, whether by prepayment or otherwise. A 
premium of £200 was offered for the best, and £100 for the next 
best, proposal for bringing stamps into use, having regard to

POST, AND POSTAL SERVICE 



" (i) the convenience as regards the public use; (2) the security 
against forgery; (3) the facility of being checked and distin- 
guished at the post office, which must of necessity be rapid; 
and (4) the expense of the production and circulation of the 
stamps." To this invitation 2600 replies were received, but no 
improvement was made upon Rowland HilTs suggestions. A 
further Minute, of the 26th of December 1839, announced that 
the treasury had decided to require that, as far as practicable, 
the postage of letters should be prepaid, and such prepayment 
effected by means of stamps. Stamped covers or wrappers, 
stamped envelopes, and adhesive stamps were to be issued by 
government. The stamps were engraved by Messrs Perkins, 
Bacon & Fetch, of Fleet Street, from Hill's designs, and the 
Mulready envelopes and covers by Messrs Clowes & Son, of 
Blackfriars. The stamps were appointed to be brought into use 
on the 6th of May 1840, but they appear to have been issued 
to the public as early as the 1st of May. The penny stamp, 
bearing a profile of Queen Victoria, was coloured black, and 
the twopenny stamp blue, with check-letters in the lower 
angles (in all four angles from April 1858). Up to the 28th of 
January 1854 the stamps were not officially perforated, except 
in the session of 1851, when stamps, perforated by a Mr 
Archer, were issued at the House of Commons post office. In 
1853 the government purchased Archer's patent for £4000. 
The .stamps were first water-marked in April 1840* 

The canton of Zurich was the first foreign state to adopt postage 
stamps, in 1843. The stamps reached America in the same year, 
being introduced by the government of Brazil. That of the United 
States did not adopt them until 1847; but a tentative issue was 
made by the post office of New York in 1845. An adhesive stamp 
was also issued at St Louis in the same year, and in Rhode Island 
in the next. In Europe the Swiss cantons of Geneva (1844) and of 
Basel (1845) soon followed the example set by Zurich. In the 
Russian Empire the use of postage stamps became general in 1848 
(after preliminary issues at St Petersburg and in Finland in 1845). 
France issued them in 1849.^ The same year witnessed their intro- 
duction into Tuscany, Belgium and Bavaria, and also into New 
South Wales'. Austria, Prussia, Saxony, Spain, Italy, followed 
in 1850. The use of postage stamps seems to have extended to 
the Hawaiian Islands ( 1 85 1 ?) a year before it reached the Dutch 
Netherlands (1852). J Within twenty-five yeare of the first issue 
of a postage stamp in London, the known varieties, issued in all 
parts of the world, amounted to 1391- Of these 8^1 were of 
European origin, 333 were American, 59 Asiatic, 55 African. The 
varieties of stamp issued in the several countries of Oceania were 
103. Of the whole 1391 stamps no less than 811 were already 
obsolete in 1865, leaving 580 still in currency.

as to colour — red instead of black. It is stated l that the colour, 
44 though always officially referred to as * red/ was really a red- 
brown, and this may be regarded as the normal colour; but con- 
siderable variations in tone and shade (brick-red, orange-red, lake- 
red) occurred from time to time, often accentuated by the blueing 
of the paper, though primarily due to a want of uniformity in the 
method employed for preparing the ink." The change of colour 
from black was made in order to render the obliteration (now in 
black instead of red ink) more distinct; imperforate. Third 
issue, February 1 854 : small crown watermark ; perforated 1 6 
(».«. 16 holes to 2 centimetres). The fourth issue, January 1855,

(iv.) After 1880. 

In 1 880-1 88 1 the halfpenny, penny, three-halfpenny and two- 
penny surface-printed stamps superseded the line-engraved stamps 
of the same value, and a new surface-printed stamp of fivepence 
was introduced. These stamps are distinguished from the stamps 
already described by the absence of plate-numbers and (except 
in the penny stamp; of check-letters in the corners ; also by the 
coarser style of engraving necessary for printing by machines 
driven by steam-power.

The Customs and Inland Revenue Act which came into force 
on June 1, 1881, made it unnecessary to provide separate penny 
stamps for postal and fiscal purposes. By an act of 1882 (45 
& 46 Vict. c. 72) it became unnecessary to provide separate stamps 
for postal and fiscal purposes up to and including stamps of the 
value of 2s. 6d. A new series was therefore issued : —

Following upon the report of a committee of officials of the 
General Post Office and Somerset House, a series of new stamps, 
commonly known as the " Jubilee " issue, was introduced on 
January 1, 1887, all of which between one halfpenny and one

POST, AND POSTAL SERVICE

France 

The French postal system was founded by Louis XI. (June 
19, 1464), was largely extended by Charles IX. (1565), and 
received considerable improvements at various 
History, periods under the respective governments of 
Henry IV. and Louis XIII. (1603, 1622, 1627 seq.). 1 
In 1627 France originated a postal money-transmission system, 
a system of cheap registration for letters. The postmaster who 
thus anticipated modern improvements was Pierre d'Alme'ras, 
a man of high birth, who gave about £20,000 (of modern money) 
for the privilege of serving the public. The turmoils of the 
Fronde wrecked much that he had achieved. The first farm of 
postal income was made in 1672, and by farmers it was adminis- 
tered until June 1790. To increase the income postmaster- 
ships for a long time were not only sold but made hereditary. 
Many administrative improvements of detail were introduced, 
indeed, by Mazarin (1643), by Louvois (c. 1680 seq.), and by 
Cardinal de Flcury (1728); but many formidable abuses also 
continued. The revolutionary government transferred rather 
than removed them. Characteristically, it put a board of post- 
masters in room of a farming postmaster-general and a con- 
trolling one. Napoleon (during the consulate 2 ) abolished the 
board, recommitted the business to a postmaster-general as it 
had been under Louis XIII., and greatly improved the details 
of the service; Napoleon's organization of 1802 is, in substance, 
that which now obtains, although, of course, large modifications 
and developments have been made from time to time. 3 

The university of Paris, as early as the -13th century, pos- 
sessed a special postal system, for the abolition of which in the 
18th it received a large compensation. But it continued to 
possess certain minor postal privileges until the Revolution. 4 

Mazarin *s edict of the 3rd of December 1643 shows that France 
at that date had a parcel post as well as a letter post. That edict 
creates for each head post office throughout the kingdom three 
several officers styled respectively (1) comptroller, (2) weigher, 
(3) assessor; and, instead of remunerating them by salary, it 
directs the addition of one-fourth to the existing letter rate and 
parcel rate, and the division of the surcharge between the three. 
Fleury's edicts of 1728 make sub-postmasters directly respon- 
sible for the loss of letters or parcels; they also make it necessary 
that senders should post their letters at an office, and not give 
them to the carriers, and regulate the book-post by directing 
that book parcels (whether MS. or printed) shall be open at the 
ends. 6 In 1758, almost eighty years after Dockwra's estab- 
lishment of a penny post in London, an historian of that city 
published an account of it, which in Paris came under the eye 
of Claude Piarron de Chamousset, 6 who obtained letters-patent 
to do the like, and, before setting to work or seeking profit for 
himself, issued a tract with the title, Mtmoire sur la petite- poste 
ttablic & Londres, sur la modUe de laquelle on pourrait en Hablir de 
semblables dans les plus grandes villes d* Europe. The reform 
was successfully carried out. 

By this time the general post office of France was producing

a considerable and growing revenue. In 1676 the farmers had 
paid to the king £48,000 in the money of that day. A century 
later they paid a fixed rent of £352,000, and covenanted to pay 
in addition one^-fifth of their net profits. In 1788 — the date 
of the last letting to farm of the postal revenue — the fixed and 
the variable payments were commuted for one settled sum of 
£480,000 a year. The result of the devastations of the Revolu- 
tion and of the wars of the empire together is shown strikingly 
by the fact that in 18 14 the gross income of the post office was 
but little more than three-fifths of the net income in 1788. Six 
years of the peaceful government of Louis XVIII. raised the 
gross annual revenue to £928,000. On the eve of the Revolution 
of 1830 it reached £1,348,000. Towards the close of the next 
reign the post office yielded £2,100,000 (gross). Under the 
revolutionary government of 1 848-1 849 it declined again (falling 
in 1850 to £i,744jOoo); under that of Napoleon III. it rose 
steadily and uniformly with every year. In 1858 the gross 
revenue was £2,296,000, in 1868 £3,596,000. 

The ingenuity of the French postal authorities was severely 
tried by the exigencies of the German War of 1870-71. The 
first contrivance was to organize a pigeon service (see p . , 

also Pigeon Post), carrying microscopic despatches b2/ooii 
prepared by the aid of photographic appliances. 7 The Posts 
number of postal pigeons employed was 363, of which 
number fifty-seven returned with despatches. During the height 
of the siege the English postal authorities received letters for 
transmission by pigeon post into Paris by way of Tours, subject 
to the regulations that no information concerning the war was 
given, that the number of words did not exceed twenty, that 
the letters were delivered open, and that 5d. a word, with a registra- 
tion fee of 6d., 8 was prepaid as postage. At this rate the postage 
of the 200 letters on each folio was £40, that on the eighteen pellicles 
of sixteen folios each, carried by one pigeon, £11,520. Each des- 
patch was repeated until its arrival had been acknowledged by 
balloon post; consequently many were sent off twenty and some 
even more than thirty times. The second step was to establish a 
regular system of postal balloons, fifty-one being employed for letter 
service and six for telegraphic service. To M. Durnouf belongs 
much of the honour of making the balloon service successful. On 
the basis of experiments carried out by him a decree of the 26th of 
September 1870 regulated the new postal system. Out of sixty- 
four several ascents, each costing on the average about £200, 
fifty-seven achieved their purpose, notwithstanding the building 
by Krupp of twenty guns, supplied with telescopic apparatus, 
for the destruction of the postal balloons. Only five were captured, 
and two others were lost at sea. The aggregate weight of the letters 
and newspapers thus aerially mailed by the French post office 
amounted to about eight tons and a half, including upwards of 
3,000,000 letters; and, besides theaeronauts, ninety-one passengers 
were conveyed. The heroism displayed by the French balloon 
postmen was equalled by that of many of the ordinary letter- 
carriers in the conveyance of letters through the catacombs and 
quarries of Paris and its suburbs, and, under various disguises, 
often through the midst of the Prussian army. Several lost their 
lives in the discharge of their duty, in some cases saving their 
despatches by the sacrifice. 9 During the war the Marseilles route 
for the Anglo-Indian mails was abandoned. They were sent 
through Belgium and Germany, by the Brenner Pass to Brindisi, 
and thence by Italian packets to Alexandria. The French route 
was resumed in 1872. 10 



7 The despatches carried by the pigeons were in the first instance 
photographed on a reduced scale on thin sheets of paper, the original 
writing being preserved, but after the ascent of the twenty-fifth 
balloon leaving the city an improved system was organized. The 
communications, whether public despatches, newspapers or private 
letters, were printed in ordinary type, and micro-photographed on 
to thin films of collodion. Each pellicle measured less than 2 in. 
by 1, and the reproduction of sixteen folio pages of type contained 
above 3000 private letters. These pellicles were so light that 
50,000 despatches, weighing less than 1 gramme, were regarded as 
the weight for one pigeon. In order to ensure their safety during 
transit the films were rolled up tightly and placed in a small quill 
which was attached longitudinally to one of the tail feathers of 
the bird. On their arrival in Paris they were flattened out and 
thrown by means of the electric lantern on to a screen, copied by 
clerks, and despatched to their destination. This method was 
afterwards improved upon, 'Sensitive paper being substituted for 
the screen, so that the letters were printed at once and distributed.

The savings banks system of France, so far as it is connected 
with the postal service, dates only from 1875, and began then (at 
first) simply by the use of post offices as agencies and feeders for 
the pre-existing banks. Prior to the postal connexion the aggre- 
gate of the deposits stood at £22,920,000. In 1877 it reached 
£32,000,000. Postal savings banks, strictly so called, began only 
during the year 1881. At the close of 1882 they had 210,712 
depositors, with an aggregate deposit of £1,872,938 sterling; in 
1905 they had 12,134,523 depositors, with an aggregate deposit 
of £229,094,155.

Austria-Hungary 
The Austrian postal system is among the oldest on record. 
Vienna possessed a local letter 'post and a parcel post, on the 
plan of prepayment, as early as May 1772, at which date no 
city in Germany possessed the like. This local post was es- 
tablished by a Frenchman (M. Hardy) and managed by a Dutch- 
man (Schooten). 1 Thirteen years after its organization it became 
merged in the imperial post. The separate postal organizations 
of the empire (Austria) and of the kingdom (Hungary) date from 
1867. In Austria the post office and the telegraph office are

German Empire 

The Prussian postal system developed mainly by the ability 
and energy of Dr Stephan, to whom the organization of the 
International Postal Union 2 was so largely indebted, into the 
admirably organized post and telegraph office of the empire — 
began with the Great Elector, and with the establishment in 
1646 of a Government post from Cleves to Memel. Frederick II. 
largely extended it, and by his successor the laws relating to 
it were consolidated. In Strasburg a messenger code existed 
as early as 1443. A postal service was organized at Nurem- 
berg in 1570. In 1803 the rights in the indemnity-lands 
(EntsckMigungslander) of the counts of Taxis as hereditary 
imperial postmasters were abolished. The first mail steam- 
packet was built in 182 1; the first transmission of mails by 
railway was in 1847; the beginning of the postal administration 
of the telegraphs was in 1849; and, by the treaty of postal 
union with Austria, not only was the basis of the existing system 
of the posts and telegraphs of Germany fully laid, but the germ 
was virtually set of the International Postal Union. That 
treaty was made for ten years on the 6th of April 1850, 
and was immediately accepted by Bavaria. It came into full 
operation on the 1st of July following, and then included 
Saxony, Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Holstein. Other German 
states followed; and the treaty was renewed in August i860.

Italy 

The origin of the Italian post office may be traced virtually 
to Venice and to the establishment of the " Corrieri di Venezia " 
early in the 16th century. As early as 1818 the Sardinian post 
office issued stamped letter-paper. The total number of 
letters, newspapers and book-packets conveyed in 1862 was but 
111,733,319. In 1900 there were 7234 post offices; letters con- 
veyed amounted to 180,349,449, post cards 82,544,547, news- 
papers, &c, 301,495,580, samples 9,117,526, official letters, 
franked, 46,302,121, postal packets 8,170,988, and registered 
letters of a declared value of £12,931,026. The receipts 
amounted to £2,429,000 and the expenses to £1,980,000. 

United States 

The early history of the post office in the British colonies in 
North America has been referred to above. Benjamin Franklin 
was removed hy the home department from his office of post- 
master-general in America in 1774. On the 26th of July 
1775 the American Congress assumed direction of the post 
offices, re-appointing Franklin to his former post. Shortly 
afterwards, when Fianklin was sent as ambassador to France, 
his son-in-law, Richard Bache, was made postmaster-general in 
November 1775. 

In 1789 the number of post offices was 75; in 1800, 903; in 
1825, 5677; in 1875, 35,734; in 1885, 51,252; in 1890, 62,401; 
in 1895, 70,064; in 1900, 76,688; and in 1905, 68,131.

The revenue quoted docs not include any allowance for 
the large quantity of official matter carried for other public 
departments, &c, indeed, the postmaster-general, in his Report 
for 1906, estimated that if the due allowance were made it 
would add approximately $20,000,000 to the revenue. The post 
office department is compelled to carry anything sent under a 
penalty frank, and franks are used by all the departments and 
their agents for the purpose of carrying everything they choose 
to send (Report, postmaster-general, 1893). The expenditure 
does not include the amounts certified to the Treasury for 
the transportation of mails over aided Pacific railways, or any 
allowance for the use of such buildings as are provided by the 
government. 

Contrary to expectations repeatedly expressed, each year shows 
a deficit. This is partly explained by reductions in charges. The 
rate of postage on first-class matter was reduced from three cents 
to two cents on the 1st of October 1883, and the unit of weight 
was increased from half an ounce to one ounce on the 1st of July 
1885. On the latter date, also, the postage on second-class matter 
was reduced from two cents to one cent per pound. This low rate 
has led to wholesale violation of the purpose of the law. In his 
report for 1899 Mr Emory Smith, postmaster-general, estimated 
that " fully one-half of all the matter mailed as second-class, and 
paid for at the pound rate, is not properly second-class within the 
intent of the law " ; and that the cost of mere transportation of 
this wrongly classed matter exceeded the revenue denved from it 
by more than $12,000,000 for the year. 

Until 1863 the rates of postage were based upon the dis- 
tances over which the mails were conveyed. In 1846 these 
rates were — not exceeding 300 m., three cents; exceeding 
300 m., ten cents. In 1851 the rates were reduced to three 
cents for distances not exceeding 3000 m. and ten cents for 
distances exceeding 3000 m. The use of adhesive postage 
stamps was first authorized by act of Congress, approved on 
the 3rd of March 1847, and on the 1st of June 1856 prepay- 
ment by stamps was made compulsory. In 1863 a uniform rate 
of postage without regard to distance was fixed at three cents, 
and on the 1st of October 1883, the rate was further reduced 
to two cents, the equivalent of the British penny postage. 

All mail matter for distribution within the United States is divided 
into four classes. First-class matter includes letters, postal cards, 
post cards and anything sealed or closed against inspection. Second- 
class _ matter includes all newspapers and periodicals exclusively 
in print that have been " entered as second-class matter," and are 
regularly issued at stated intervals as frequently as four times 
a year from a known office of publication and mailed by publishers 
or newsagents to actual subscribers or to newsagents for sale, and 
newspapers and publications of this class mailed by persons other 
than publishers. The rates of postage to publishers are one cent 
a pound, and to other than publishers, one cent for each four 
ounces. Third-class matter includes printed books, pamphlets, 
engravings and circulars in print or reproduced by a copying 
process. The rate for third-class matter is one cent for each two 
ounces. Fourth-class matter is all mailable matter not included 
in the three preceding classes which is so prepared for mailing as 
to be easily withdrawn from the wrapper and examined. The rate 
is one cent for each ounce. 

The franking privilege, which had grown to be an intolerable 
abuse, was temporarily abolished in 1873, but the post office now 
carries free under official " penalty " labels or envelopes (i.e. 
envelopes containing a notice of the legal penalty for their un- 
authorized use) matter which is of an official character, the 
privilege being extended to congressmen and government officials 
(see Franking). As late as i860 the mails conveyed nothing but 
written and printed matter. They now admit nearly every known 
substance which does not exceed four pounds in weight (this re- 
striction does not apply to single books), and which from its nature 
is not liable to injure the mails or the persons of postal employes. 

A delivery system existed in a number of cities of the Union in 
1862, the carriers remunerating themselves by the collection of a 
voluntary fee of from one to two cents on each piece of mail 
delivered. A uniform free delivery system was first authorized 
by law on the 3rd of March 1863, and was established on the 
succeeding 1st of July in forty-nine cities. The number of 
carriers employed the first year was 685. On the 1st of July 
1884 there were 3890 letter-carriers in one hundred and fifty- 
nine " free delivery cities." 

The free delivery service has grown rapidly. On the 1st of July 
1 901, 866 cities and towns were included in the scheme, and

16,389 letter-carriers were serving a population of 32,000,000. 
An extension to rural districts was started in 1896, and by 
December 1901, 4,000,000 of the rural population were within 
the scope of free delivery. Since the 1st of October 1885 a 
system has been in force for the immediate delivery by 
special messengers of letters, parcels, &c, for addresses within 
certain areas. A special ten-cent stamp (or its equivalent) is 
required in addition to the ordinary postage. _ 

The registry system did not attain any degree of excellence 
until after i860; and the money-order system was first established 
in 1864. The aggregate number of money orders, domestic and 
foreign, issued during the fiscal year 1906 was 61,497,861, of the 
value of $507,563,719. A step towards the popularization of the 
registry system was authorized in December 1899; letter-carriers 
in many city districts now accept and register letters at the door 
of the householder. Sea post offices for sorting mails during the 
Atlantic transit were established in December 1890 on the steamers 
of the North German Lloyd and Hamburg-American lines, and later 
on the vessels of the International Navigation Company. This 
plan effects a saving of from two to fourteen hours in the delivery 
of mails from Europe. The issue of " postal notes," commenced 
in 1883, was abandoned in 1894. The introduction of " postal 
checks for small fixed amounts has been advocated. A new 
postal convention with Canada, removing the former restriction 
against sending merchandise, came into force on the 1st of March 
1888. Uniformity of postage rates having been previously estab- 
lished, the United States and Canada became virtually one postal 
territory. 

A convention for an exchange of parcels with Jamaica, admitting 
articles not exceeding 11 lb, was agreed to in 1887; and since 
then conventions on similar lines have been concluded with other 
colonies and countries in America. The first arrangement of 
the kind with any European country was made with Germany, 
and came into operation on the 1st of October 1899. The postal 
laws, regulations and domestic conditions of the United States 
have been extended, by act of Congress, to Porto Rico and Hawaii. 
The " island possessions " (Guam, the Philippine Archipelago and 
Tutuila) have also been brought within the scope of the domestic 
conditions, including the rates of postage. The service introduced 
into Cuba, though modelled on the American plan, is practically 
autonomous. 

Telegraphs, — The formation of a postal telegraph system has 
continued to be a subject of discussion by the postmasters- 
general. In his report for the year 1888 D. M. Dickinson pro- 
posed the appointment of an expert commission authorized 
to erect short experimental lines. His successor, John Wana- 
maker, for four years vigorously advocated a limited postal 
telegraph service. Under this proposal, contracting telegraph 
companies were to "furnish lines, instruments and operators, and 
to transmit messages at rates fixed by the government; the 
department was to receive a small sum per message, to cover 
its expenses in collection and delivery. In 1894 Mr Bissell 
expressed the opinion that a government system would be 
unprofitable and inexpedient. 

Savings Banks. — The establishment of postal savings banks 
was also recommended by Mr Wanamaker in his reports for the 
years 1889 to 1892, and by J. A. Gary in 1897. What is regarded 
as a step in this direction was taken in 1898, when the postal 
regulations were modified to allow money orders to be made 
payable at the office of issue, — a " mild and very convenient 
adaptation of the European savings bank system, without the 
payment of interest" (Mr Emory Smith). Finally in 1910 a 
system of postal savings banks was authorized by Congress.

POST AND PAIR, a card game popular in the 16th and 17th 
centuries. A hand consisted of three cards, a pair royal ranking 
highest, or failing this, the highest pair. Another name of the 
game was Pink. 



POSTER, a placard in the form either of letterpress or 
illustration, for posting up or otherwise exhibiting in public to 
attract attention to its contents. According to Brewer's 
Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, before the Fire pi London the rails 
and posts which protected foot-passengers in the streets were 
used for affixing theatrical and other announcements, whence 
the name of posting-bills or posters; and in later times the name 
has come more generally into use for any fairly large separate 
sheet, illustrated or not, used to attract publicity, even though 
not actually posted up. In the article Advertisements the 
use of posters is discussed, and newspaper posters (or contents 
bills) under Newspapers. But the illustrated poster has come 
to represent a special form of artistic design. 

The earliest examples of pictorial posters were adorned with 
rough woodcuts. When lithography became a common commercial 
process, wood-blocks ceased to be employed. The modern artistic 
poster made a definite beginning in France about 1836, with a 
design by Lalance to advertise a book entitled Comment meurent 
les femmes. His example was followed by C. Nanteuil, D. A. M. 
Raffet, Gavarni, Bertrand, Grandville, Tony Johannot, E. de 
Beaumont, T. H. Frere, Edouard Manet and other artists of high 
repute. Most of these early designs were printed in black on white 
or tinted paper. Between i860 and 1866 crude attempts at print- 
ing posters in colours were made in both France and England. 
In 1866 Jules Cheret began what was destined to be the most 
noticeable series of pictorial placards in existence, a series containing 
over a thousand items. Cheret was originally employed in a litho- 
graphic establishment in England before he began to work for him- 
self, and he used his knowledge there acquired to adapt all three 
primary colours, economically used, to astonishingly brilliant ends. 
For a considerable time he remained without a rival, though he 
had hosts of imitators. Eugene Grasset, a decorative designer 
of great versatility, produced the first of a small number of placards 
which, though inferior as advertisements to those of Cheret, were 
learned and beautiful decorations. Somewhat later a sensation 
was caused in Paris by the mordantly grotesque posters of Henri 
de Toulouse-Lautrec, in which the artist reduced detail to a mini- 
mum and obtained bold effects by the employment of large masses 
of flat colour. Important work, similar in character to Lautrec's, 
was produced by Ibcls, Bonnard, T. A. Stcinlen and others. A new 
and contrary direction was given to poster design by Mucha, a 
Hungarian resident in Paris, whose placards are marked by delicate 
colour and richness of detail. The following are amongst French 
artists who have designed posters of conspicuous merit: J. L. 
Forain, Willette, Paleologue, Sinet, Tossot, Roedel, Mayet, Cazals, 
Biais, De Feure, A. Guillaume, Ranft, Realier-Dumas, F. Valloton 
and Metivet. Occasionally eminent French painters, such as 
Carriere, Boutet de Monvel, Aman-Jean, Schwabe, have made 
essays in poster-designing. 

In England the first artists of repute to attempt the pictorial 
placard were Godfroy Durand and Walter Crane; but the first 
bill to attract widespread attention was one by Fred Walker to 
advertise a dramatized version of The Woman in White (1871). 
This was engraved on wood by W. H. Hooper. Shortly after this 
time pictures by Royal Academicians and others began to be re- 
produced as advertisements (the best-known case" being that of 
Sir John Millais's " Bubbles "), but these have nothing directly 
to do with poster-designing. Stacy Marks, Hubert von Herkomer 
(the great poster for the Magazine of Art), Sir Edward Poynter 
and Sir James Linton are among popular painters who have made 
special drawings for reproduction as posters. 

About 1894 the English poster began to improve. Designs by 
Aubrey Beardsley for the Avenue Theatre, by Dudley Hardy for 
various plays, and by Maurice GreifTenhagen for The Pall Mall 
Budget, were widely noticed by reason of their originality, sim- 
plicity and effectiveness. Simplicity was carried even farther by 
" the Beggarstaff Brothers " (James Pryde and William Nicholson), 
whose posters are perhaps the most original yet produced by 
Englishmen. Among other British designers the following have 
executed artistic and interesting placards: Frank Brangwyn, 
R. Anning Bell, John Hassall, Cecil Aldin, Phil May, Leonard 
Raven-Hill, Henry Harland, Robert Fowler, Wilson Steer, Charles 
R. Mackintosh, MacNair and MacDonald, Edgar Wilson, Charles 
I. Foulkes, Mabel Dearmer, Albert Morrow andfC. Wilhelm. 

Poster design on the continent of Europe has been largely influ- 
enced by French work, but designs of much originality have been 
made in Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain. In Germany, 
among the most typical posters are those of Sattler, Otto Fischer, 
Gysis, T. T. Heine, Speyer, Max Klinger, Dasio, Hofmann and 
L. Zumbrusch. The principal Belgian designers include Priyat 
Livemont, Rassenfosse, Berchmans, Meumer, Duyck and Crespin, 
V. Mignot, Donnay, Evenepoel, Cassiers and Toussaint. Of 
Italian designers those whose work is most characteristic arc Mata- 
loni and Hohenstein; while the best Spanish posters — those to 
advertise bull-fights and fairs — are mostly anonymous. The 
Spanish artists Utrillo and Casas have signed posters of more than

ordinary merit. Curious if not very artistic bills have been pro- 
duced in Russia ; and in Austria good work has been done by Orlik, 
Schlicssmann ; Oliva and Hynais. 

In the United States of America, however, with the exception 
of some designs by Matt Morgan, few posters of artistic interest 
were produced before 1889, in which year Louis J. Rhead commenced 
a notable series of decorative placards. Will H. Bradley began 
to produce his curious decorative grotesque posters a little later. 
If American artists arc behind Europeans in the artistic designing 
of large posters they have no rivals in the production of small 
illustrated placards tor publishers of books and magazines. Chief 
among those who have devoted themselves to this branch of poster 
design is Edward Penfield. Others who have achieved success 
in it include Maxfield Parrish, Ethel Reed, Will Carquevillc, J. J. 
Gould, J. C. Leyendecker, Frank Hazcnplug, Charles Dana Gibson, 
Will Denslow, Florence Lundbourg and Henry Mayer. 

Exhibitions of artistic posters have been held in the chief cities 
of Europe and America, and the illustrated placard has already 
a literature of its own. In England a monthly magazine (The 
Poster) was for a time specially devoted to its interests, and col- 
lectors are numerous and enthusiastic.

POSTERN (from 0. Fr. poslerne, posterle, Late Lat. posterula, 
small back-door, posterns , behind), a small gateway in tbe 
enceinte of a castle, abbey, &c, from which to issue and enter 
unobserved. They are often called " sally ports." (See Gate.) 

POSTHUMOUS, that which appears or is produced after the 
author or creator, and thus applied to a literary work or 
work of art published or produced after its author's death, 
or especially to a child born after the death of its father. 
The Latin poslumus, latest, last, from which the word is 
derived, is formed from post, after, but it was in Late Latin 
connected with humare, to place in the ground (humus), to 
bury. 

POSTICHE, a French term for a pretentious imitation, a 
counterfeit, particularly used of an inartistic addition to an 
otherwise perfect work of art. The French word was adapted 
from the Italian posticcio, from Latin positus, placed, added. 

POSTIL, or Apostil, properly a gloss on a scriptural text, 
particularly on a gospel text, hence any explanatory note on 
other writings. The word is also applied to a general commen- 
tary, and also to a homily or discourse on the gospel or epistle 
appointed for the day. The word in Medieval Latin was postilla, 
and this has been taken to represent post ilia sc. verba lextus, 
i.e. " after these words of the text " (see Du Cange, Glossarium, 
s.v. postillae), but the form " apostil " may point to the Latin 
appositum, placed near or next to. 

POSTILION (through the Fr. from the Ital. postiglione) , 
a postboy, rider of a post-horse, hence any swift messenger, 
but more particularly the rider of the near horse of a vehicle 
drawn by two or more horses where there is no driver. The 
swift travelling postchaises of the 18th and early 19th centuries 
were usually driven by postilions. 

POSTUMIA, VIA, an ancient highroad of northern Italy, 
constructed in 148 B.C. by the consul Spurius Postumius Albinus. 
It ran from the coast at Genua through the mountains to 
Dertona, Placentia (the termination of the Via Aemilia Lepidi) 
and Cremona, just east of the point where it crossed the Po. 
From Cremona the road ran eastward to Bedriacum, where it 
forked, one branch running to the left to Verona and thence 
to the Brenner, the other to the right to Mantua, Altinum and 
Aquileia. The military occupation of Liguria depended upon 
this road, and several of the more important towns owed their 
origin largely to it. Cremona was its central point, the distances 
being reckoned from it both eastwards and westwards. 

(T. As.) 

POSY (a shortened form of poesy, Fr. poisie, poetry), a 
verse of poetry or a motto, either with a moral or religious 
sentiment or message of love, often inscribed in a ring or sent 
with a present, such as a bouquet of flowers, which may be the 
origin of the common use of the word for a nosegay or bouquet. 



It has been suggested that this use is due to the custom of the 
symbolic use of flowers. Skeat quotes the title of a tract (Heber's 
MSS. No. 1442)* " A new yeare's guifte, or a posie made upon 
certen flowers," &c. "Posy rings," plain or engraved gold 
rings with a " posy " inscribed on the inside of the hoops, were 
very frequently in use as betrothal rings from the 16th to the 
18th centuries. Common " posies " were such lines as " In 
thee my choice I do rejoice," " As God decreed so we agreed," 
and the like. There are several rings of this kind in the British 
Museum. 

POTASHES, the crude potassium carbonate obtained by 
lixiviating wood ashes and evaporating* the solution to dryness, 
an operation at one time carried out in iron pots — hence the 
name from " pot " and " ashes." The term potash or caustic 
potash is frequently used for potassium hydroxide, whilst such 
a phrase as sulphate of potash is now appropriately replaced by 
potassium sulphate. (See Potassium.) 

POTASSIUM [symbol K (from kalium), atomic weight 39-114 
0=i6)], a metallic chemical element, belonging to the group 
termed the metals of the alkalis. Although never found free 
in nature, in combination the metal is abundantly and widely 
distributed. In the oceans alone there are estimated to be 
1141X10 12 tons of sulphate, K2SO4, but this inexhaustible store 
is not much drawn upon; and the "salt gardens" on the coast 
of France lost their industrial importance as potash-producers 
since the deposits at Stassfurt in Germany have come to be 
worked. These deposits, in addition to common salt, include the 
following minerals: sylvine, KG; carnallite, KCl-MgCl 2 -6H 2 
(transparent, deliquescent crystals, often red with diffused 
oxide of iron); kainite, K 2 S04-MgS0 4 -MgCl 2 6H 2 (hard 
crystalline masses, permanent in the air); kieserite MgS04-H 2 
(only very slowly dissolved by water); besides polyhalite, 
MgS0 4 -K 2 S04-2CaS0 4 -2H 2 0- anhydrite, CaSQ 4 ; salt, NaCl, and 
some minor components. These potassium minerals are not con- 
fined to Stassfurt; larger quantities of sylvine and kainite are 
met with in the salt mines of Kalusz in the eastern Carpathian 
Mountains. The Stassfurt minerals owe their industrial import- 
ance to their solubility in water and consequent ready amenability 
to chemical operations. In point of absolute mass they are 
insignificant compared with the abundance and variety of potas- 
siferous silicates, which occur everywhere in the earth's crust; 
orthoclase (potash felspar) and potash mica may be quoted as 
prominent examples. Such potassiferous silicates are found in 
almost all rocks, both as normal and as accessory components; 
and their disintegration furnishes the soluble potassium salts 
which are found in all fertile soils. These salts are sucked up by 
the roots of plants, and by taking part in the process of nutrition 
are partly converted into oxalate, tartrate, and other organic 
salts, which, when the plants are burned, are converted into the 
carbonate, K 2 CC>3. It is a remarkable fact that, although in a 
given soil the soda-content may predominate largely over the 
potash salts, the plants growing in the soil take up the latter: 
in the ashes of most land plants the potash (calculated as K 2 0) 
forms upwards of 90% of the total alkali. The proposition 
holds, in its general sense, for sea plants likewise. In ocean 
water the ratio of soda (Na 2 0) to potash (K 2 0) is 100:3-23 
(Dittmar); in kelp it is, on the average, 100: 5-26 (Richardson). 
Ashes particularly rich in potash are those of burning nettles, 
wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), 
fumitory (Fumaria officinalis), and tobacco. In fact, the ashes 
of herbs generally are richer in potash than those of the trunks 
and branches of trees; yet, for obvious reasons, the latter are 
of greater industrial importance as sources of potassium car- 
bonate. According to Liebig, potassium is the essential alkali 
of the animal body; and it may be noted that sheep excrete 
most of the potassium which they take from the land as sweat, 
one-third of the weight of raw merino consisting of potassium 
compounds. 

To Sir Humphry Davy belongs the merit of isolating this 
element from potash, which itself had previously been considered 
an element. On placing a piece of potash on a platinum plate, 
connected to the negative of a powerful electric battery, and 



198 



POTASSIUM 



bringing a platinum wire, connected to the positive of the 
battery, to the surface of the potassium a vivid action was 
observed: gas was evolved at the upper surface of the 
fused globule of potash, whilst at the lower surface, adjacent 
to the platinum plate, minute metallic globules were formed, 
some of which immediately inflamed, whilst others merely 
tarnished. In 1808 Gay-Lussac and Thenard (Ann. chim. 
6 5> P- 3 2 S) obtained the metal by passing melted potash 
down a clay tube containing iron turnings or wire heated to 
whiteness, and Caradau (ibid. 66, p. 97) effected the same 
decomposition with charcoal at a white heat. This last process 
was much improved by Brunner, Wohler, and especially by 
F. M. L. Donny and J. D. B. Mareska (Ann. chim. phys., 1852, 
(3)» 35> P- J 47)- B runner's process consisted in forming an 
intimate mixture of potassium carbonate and carbon by igniting 
crude tartar in covered iron crucibles, cooling the mass, and then 
distilling it at a white heat from iron bottles, the vaporized 
metal being condensed beneath the surface of paraffin or naphtha 
contained in a copper vessel. It was found, however, that if 
the cooling be not sufficiently rapid explosions occurred owing 
to tbe combination of the metal with carbon monoxide (produced 
in the oxidation of the charcoal) to form the potassium salt 
of hexaoxybenzene. In Mareska and Donny's process the con- 
densation is effected in a shallow iron box, which has a large 
exposed surface, capable of being cooled by damped cloths. 
When the distillation is finished the iron box, after cooling, is 
undamped and the product turned out beneath the surface of 
paraffin. It is purified by redistilling and condensing directly 
under paraffin. Electrolytic processes have also been devised. 
Linnemann (Journ. Prak. Chem., 1858, 73, p. 413) obtained the 
metal on a small scale by electrolysing potassium cyanide between 
carbon electrodes; A. Matthiessen (Journ. Chem. Soc, 1856, 
p. 30) electrolysed an equimolecular mixture of potassium and 
calcium chlorides (which melts at a lower temperature than 
potassium chloride) also between carbon electrodes ; whilst 
Castner's process, in which caustic potash is electrolysed, is 
employed commercially. The metal, however, is not in great 
demand, for it is generally found that sodium (q.v.), which is 
cheaper, and, weight for weight, more reactive, will fulfil any 
purpose for which potassium may be desired. 

Pure potassium is a silvery white metal tinged with blue; 
but on exposure to air it at once forms a film of oxide, and on 
prolonged exposure deliquesces into a solution of hydrate and 
carbonate. Perfectly dry oxygen, however, has no action upon 
it. At temperatures below o° C. it is pretty hard and brittle; 
at the ordinary temperature it is so soft that it can be kneaded 
between the fingers and cut with a blunt knife. Its specific 
gravity is 0-865; hence- it is the lightest metal known except 
lithium. It fuses at 62-5°C. (Bunsen) and boils at 667 , 
emitting an intensely green vapour. It may be obtained 
crystallized in quadratic octahedra of a greenish-blue colour, 
by melting in a sealed tube containing an inert gas, and inverting 
the tube when the metal has partially solidified. When heated 
in air it fuses and then takes fire, burning into a mixture 
of oxides. Most remarkable, and characteristic for the group 
it represents, is its action on water. A pellet of potassium 
when thrown on water at once bursts out into a violet flame 
and the burning metal fizzes about on the surface, its extremely 
high temperature precluding absolute contact with the liquid, 
exceDt at the very end, when the last remnant, through loss of 
temperature, is wetted by the water and bursts with explosive 
violence. The reaction may be written 2K+2H 2 = 2KOH+H2, 
and the flame is due to the combustion of the hydrogen, the 
violet colour being occasioned by the potassium vapour. The 
metal also reacts with alcohol to form potassium ethylate, 
while hydrogen escapes, this time without inflammation: 
K+C 2 H 5 -OH = C 2 Hi-OK+H. When the oxide-free metal is 
heated gently in dry ammonia it is gradually transformed into a 
blue liquid, which on cooling freezes into a yellowish-brown or 
flesh-coloured solid, potassamide, KNH 2 . When heated to redness 
the amide is decomposed into ammonia and potassium nitride, 
NK3, which is an almost black solid. Both it and the amide 



decompose water readily with formation of ammonia and caustic 
potash. Potassium at temperatures from 2oo°to 4oo°C. occludes 
hydrogen gas, the highest degree of saturation corresponding 
approximately to the formula K 2 H. In a vacuum or in suffi- 
ciently dilute hydrogen the compound from 200 upwards loses 
hydrogen, until the tension of the free gas has arrived at the 
maximum value characteristic of that temperature (Troost 
and Hautefeuille). 

Compounds. 

Oxides and Hydroxide. — Potassium forms two well-defined oxides, 
K2O and K2O4, whilst several others, of less certain existence, 
have been describe'd. The monoxide, K 2 0, may be obtained by 
strongly heating the product or burning the metal in slightly 
moist air; by heating the hydroxide with the metal: 2KHO-f-2K = 
2K2O+H2; or by passing pure and almost dry air over the molten 
metal (Kuhnemann, Chem. Centr., 1863, p. 491). It forms a grey 
brittle mass, having a conchoidal fracture; it is very deliquescent, 
combining very energetically with water to form caustic potash. 
According to Holt and Sims (Journ. Chem. Soc, 1894, p. 438), the 
substance as obtained above always contains free potassium. 

Potassium hydroxide or caustic potash, KOH, formerly considered 
to be an oxide but shown subsequently to be a hydroxide of potas- 
sium, may be obtained by dissolving the metal or monoxide in water, 
but is manufactured by double decomposition from potassium 
carbonate and slaked lime: KXOs+CafOH^^KOH+CaCO,. 
A solution of one part of the carbonate in 12 parts of water is heated 
to boiling in a cast-iron vessel (industrially by means of steam- 
pipes) and the milk of lime added in instalments until a sample 
of the filtered mixture no longer effervesces with an excess of acid. 
The mixture is then allowed to settle in the iron vessel, access of 
air being prevented as much as practicable, and the clear liquor is 
syphoned off. The remaining mud of calcium carbonate and hydrate 
is washed, by decantation, with small instalments of hot water 
to recover at least part of the alkali diffused throughout it, but this 
process must not be continued too long or else some of the lime 
passes into solution. The liquors after a concentration in iron 
vessels are now evaporated in a silver dish, until the heavy vapour 
of the hydrate is seen to go off. The residual oily liquid is then 
poured out into a polished iron tray, or into an iron mould to pro- 
duce the customary form of " sticks," and allowed to cool. The 
solid must be at once bottled, because it attracts the moisture 
and carbonic acid of the air with great avidity and deliquesces. 
According to Dittmar (Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind. t May 1884), nickel 
basins are far better adapted than iron basins for the preliminary 
concentration of potash ley. The latter begin to oxidize before 
the ley has come up to the traditional strength of specific gravity 
1 *333 when cold, while nickel is not attacked so long as the percent- 
age of real KHO is short of 60. For the fusion of the dry hydrate 
nickel vessels cannot be used; in fact, even silver is perceptibly 
attacked as soon as all the excess of water is away; absolutely pure 
KHO can be produced only in gold vessels. Glass and (to a less 
extent) porcelain are attacked by caustic potash ley, slowly in the 
cold, more readily on boiling. 

Solid caustic potash forms an opaque, white, stone-like mass 
of dense granular fracture; specific gravity 2"i. It fuses consider- 
ably below and is perceptibly volatile at a red heat. At a white 
heat the vapour breaks down into potassium, hydrogen and oxygen. 
It is extremely soluble in even cold water, and in any proportion 
of water on boiling. On crystallizing a solution, the hydrate 
KOH.2H2O is deposited; 2KOH-qH 2 and 2KOH-5H 2 have also 
been obtained. The solution is intensely " alkaline " to test- 
papers. It readily dissolves the epidermis of the skin and many 
other kinds of animal tissue — hence the former application of the 
" sticks " in surgery. A dilute potash readily emulsionizes fats, and 
on boiling saponifies them with formation of a soap and glycerin. 
All commercial caustic potash is contaminated with excess of water 
(over and above that in the KHO) and with potassium carbonate 
send chloride; sulphate, as a rule, is absent. A preparation sufficing 
for most purposes is obtained by digesting the commercial article 
in absolute alcohol, decanting and evaporating the solution to 
dryness and fusing in silver vessels. 

The peroxide, K2O4, discovered by Gay-Lussac and Thenard, 
is obtained by heating the metal in an excess of slightly moist 
air or oxygen. Vernon Harcourt (Journ. Chem. Soc, 1862, p. 267) 
recommends melting the. metal in a flask filled with nitrogen and 
gradually displacing this gas by oxygen; the first formed grey 
film on the metal changes to a deep blue, and then the gas is rapidly 
absorbed, the film becoming white and afterwards yellow. It is 
a dark yellow powder, which fuses at a high temperature, the 
liquid on cooling depositing shining tabular crystals; at a white 
heat it loses oxygen and yields the monoxide. Exposed to moist 
air it loses oxygen, possibly giving the dioxide, K 2 2 ; water reacts 
with it, evolving much heat and giving caustic potash, hydrogen 
peroxide and oxygen; whilst carbon monoxide gives potassium 
carbonate and oxygen at temperatures below ioo°. A violent 
reaction ensues with phosphorus and sulphur, and many metals 
are oxidized by it, some with incandescence.

Halogen Compounds. — Potassium fluoride, KF, is a very deliques- 
cent salt, crystallizing in cubes and having a sharp saline taste, 
which is formed by neutralizing potassium carbonateor hydroxide 
with hydrofluoric acid and concentrating in platinum vessels. 
It forms the acid fluoride KHFj when dissolved in aqueous hydro- 
fluoric acid, a salt which at a red heat gives the normal fluoride 
and hydrofluoric acid. Other salts of composition KF-2HF and 
KF3HF, have been described by Moissan (Compt. rend., 1888, 
106, p. 547). 

Potassium chloride, KG, also^ known as^ muriate of potash, 
closely resembles ordinary salt. It is produced in immense quantities 
at Stassfurt from the so-called " Abraumsalze." For the purpose 
of the manufacturer of this salt these are assorted into a raw 
material containing approximately, in 100 parts, 55-65 of carnallite 
(representing 16 parts of potassium chloride), 20-25 of common 
salt, 1 §-20 of kieserite; 2-1 of tachhydrite (CaClr2MgCl|-i2H 2 0), 
and minor components. This mixture is now wrought mainly in 
two ways. (1) The salt is dissolved in water with the help of 
steam, and the solution is cooled down to from 60® to 70 , when 
a quantity of impure common salt crystallizes out, which is removed. 
The decanted ley deposits on standing a 70% potassium chloride, 
which is purified by washing with cold water. Common salt 
principally goes into solution, and the percentage may thus be 
brought up to from 80 to 95. The mother-liquor from the 70% 
chloride is evaporated, the common salt which separates out in the 
heat removed as it appears, and the sufficiently concentrated 
liquor allowed to crystallize, when^ almost pure carnallite separates 
out, which is easily decomposed into its components (see infra). 
(2) Ziervogel and Tuchen's method. — The crude salt is ground up 
and then heated in a concentrated solution of magnesium chloride 
with agitation. The carnallite^ principally dissolves and crystal- 
lizes out relatively pure on cooling. The mother-liquor is used for 
a subsequent extraction of fresh raw salt. The carnallite produced 
is dissolved in hot water and the solution allowed to cool, when it 
deposits a coarse granular potassium chloride containing up to. 
99% of the pure substance. The undissolved residue produced 
in either process consists chiefly of kieserite and common salt. 
It is worked up either for Epsom salt and common salt, ov for 
sodium sulphate and magnesium chloride. The potassiferous 
by-products are utilized for the manufacture of manures. 

Chemically pure chloride of potassium is most conveniently 
prepared from the pure perchlorate by heating it in a platinum basin 
at the lowest temperature and then fusing the residue in a well- 
covered platinum crucible. The fused product solidifies on cooling 
into a colourless glass. 

When hydrochloric acid gas is passed into the solution the 
salt is completely precipitated as a fine powder. If the original 
solution contained the chlorides of magnesium or calcium or sulphate 
of potassium all impurities remain in the mother-liquor (the 
sulphur as KHSO*), and can be removed by washing the precipitate 
with strong hydrochloric acid. The salt crystallizes in^ cubes of 
specific gravity 1.995; it melts at about 800 and volatilizes at a 
bright red heat. When melted in a current of hydrogen or electro- 
lysed in the same condition, a dark blue mass is obtained of uncer- 
tain composition. It is extensively employed for the preparation 
of other potassium salts, but the largest^ quantity (especially of the 
impure product) is used in the production of artificial manures. 

Potassium bromide, KBr, may be obtained by dissolving bromine 
in potash, whereupon bromide and bromate are first formed, evapor- 
ating and igniting the product in order to decompose the bromate: 
6KHO + 3Br, = sKBr + KBrO a + 3H 2 0; 2KBrO, = 2KBr + 30, 
(cf. Chlorates); but it is manufactured by acting with bromine 
water on iron filings and decomposing the iron bromide thus formed 
with potassium carbonate. In appearance it closely resembles 
the chloride, forming colourless cubes which readily dissolve in 
water and melt at 722 °. It combines with bromine to form an 
unstable tribromide, KBri (see F. P. Worley, Journ. Ckem. Soc. t 
1905, 87,p. 1 107). 

Potassium iodide, KI, is obtained by dissolving iodine in potash, 
the deoxidation of the iodate being facilitated by the^ addition 
of charcoal before ignition, proceeding as with the bromide. The 
commercial salt usually has an alkaline reaction ; it may be purified 
by dissolving in the minimum amount of water, and neutralizing 
with dilute sulphuric acid ; alcohol is now added to precipitate the 
potassium sulphate, the solution filtered and crystallized. It 
forms colourless cubes which are readily soluble in water, melt 
at 685 , and yield a vapour of normal density. It is sparingly 
soluble in absolute alcohol. Both the iodide and bromide are 
used in photography. Iodine dissolves in an aqueous solution 
of the salt to form a dark brown liquid, which on evaporation 
over sulphuric acid gives black acicular crystals of the tn-iodide, 
KI|. This salt is very deliquescent; it melts at 45 , and at ioo° 
decomposes into iodine and potassium iodide. For the oxy- 
halogen salts see Chlorate, Chlorine, Bromine and Iodine. 

Potassium carbonate, K a COj, popularly known as " potashes," 
was originally obtained in countries where wood was cheap by 
lixiviating wood ashes in wooden tubs, evaporating the solution 
to dryness in iron pots and calcining the residue; in more recent 
practice the calcination is carried out in reverberatory furnaces. 
This product, known as " crude potashes," contains, in addition 



to carbonate, varying amounts of sulphate and chloride and also 
insoluble matter. Crude potash is used for the manufacture of 

flass, and, after being causticized, for the making of soft soap, 
or many other purposes it must be refined, which is done by 
treating the crude product with the minimum of cold water re- 
quired to dissolve the carbonate, removing the undissolved part 
(which consists chiefly of sulphate), and evaporating the clear 
liquor to dryness in an iron pan. The purified carbonate (which 
still contains most of the chloride of the raw material and other 
impurities) is known as " pearl ashes." Large quantities of carbon- 
ate used to be manufactured from the aqueous residue left in the 
distillation of beet-root spirit, i.e. indirectly from beet-root molasses. 
The liquors are evaporated to dryness and the residue is ignited to 
obtain a very impure carbonate, which is purified by methods 
founded on the different solubilities of -the several components. 
Most of the carbonate which now occurs in commerce is made from 
the chloride of the Stassfurt beds by an adaptation of the " Leblanc 
process " for the conversion of common salt into soda ash (see 
Alkali Manufacture). 

Chemically pure carbonate of potash is best prepared by igniting 
pure bicarbonate (see below) in iron or (better) in silver or platinum 
vessels, 01* else by calcining pure cream of tartar. The latter opera- 
tion furnishes an intimate mixture of the carbonate with charcoal, 
from which the carbonate is, extracted by lixiviation with water 
and filtration. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness (in iron or 
platinum vessels) and the residue fully dehydrated by gentle 
ignition. The salt is thus obtained "as a white porous mass, fusible 
at a red heat (838° C, Carnelley) into a colourless liquid, which 
solidifies into a white opaque mass. The dry salt is very hygro- 
scopic; it deliquesces into an oily solution (''oleum tartari J in 
ordinary air. The most saturated solution contains "205 parts 
of the salt to 100 of water and boils at 135 . On crystallizing a 
solution monoclinic crystals of 2K1CO1.3H2O are deposited, which 
at ioo° lose water and give a white powder of KjCOj.HiO; this 
is completely dehydrated at 130 . The carbonate, being insoluble 
in strong alcohol (and many other liquid organic compounds), is 
much used for dehydration of the corresponding aqueous prepara- 
tions.^ The pure carbonate is constantly used in the laboratory as 
a basic substance generally, for the disintegration of silicates, and 
as a precipitant. The industrial preparation serves for the making 
of flint glass, of potash soap (soft soap) and of caustic potash. 

Potassium bicarbonate, KHCOj, is obtained when carbonic acid 
is passed through a cold solution of the ordinary carbonate as long 
as it is absorbed. ^ Any ^ silicate ^ present ^ is also converted into 
bicarbonate with elimination of silica, which must be filtered off. • 
The filtrate is evaporated at a temperature not exceeding 6o° or 
at most 70 C; after sufficient concentration it deposits on cooling 
anhydrous crystals of the salt f> while the potassium chloride, which 
may be present as an impurity, remains mostly in the mother- 
liquor; the rest is easily removed by repeated recrystallization. 
If an absolutely pure preparation is wanted it is best to follow 
Wohler and start with the " black flux " produced by the ignition 
of pure bitartrate. The flux is moistened with water and exposed to 
a current of carbonic acid, which, on account of the condensing 
action of the charcoal, is absorbed with great avidity. The 
bicarbonate forms large monoclinic prisms, permanent in the air. 
When the dry salt is heated to 190 it decomposes into normal 
carbonate, carbon dioxide and water. 

Potassium sulphide, KjS, was obtained by Berzelius in pale red 
crystals by passing hydrogen over potassium sulphate, and by 
Berthier as a flesh-coloured mass by heating the sulphate with 
carbon. It appears, however, that these products contain higher 
sulphides. On saturating a solution of caustic potash with sulphur- 
etted hydrogen and adding a second equivalent of alkali, a solution 
is obtained which on evaporation in a vacuum deposits crystals 
of KjS.5H 3 0. The solution is strongly caustic. It turns yellow 
on exposure to air, absorbing oxygen and carbon dioxide and 
forming thiosulphate and potassium carbonate and liberating 
sulphuretted hydrogen, which decomposes^ into water and sulphur, 
the latter combining with the monosulphide to form higher salts. 
The solution also decomposes on boiling. The hydrosulphide, 
KHS, was obtained by Gay-Lussac on heating the metal in sulphur- 
etted hydrogen, and by Berzelius on acting with sulphuretted hydro- 
gen on potassium carbonate at a dull red heat. It forms a yellowish- 
white deliquescent mass, which melts on heating, and at a 
sufficiently high temperature it yields a dark red liquid. It is 
readily soluble in water, and on evaporation in a vacuum over 
caustic lime it deposits colourless, rhombohcdral crystals of 
2KHS.H1O. The solution is more easily prepared by saturating 
potash solution with sulphuretted hydrogen. The solution has 
a bitter taste, and on exposure to the air turns yellow, but on long 
exposure it recovers its original colourless appearance owing to the 
formation of thiosulphate. Liver of sulphur or hepar sulphuris, 
a medicine known to the alchemists, is a mixture of various poly- 
sulphides with the sulphate and thiosulphate, in variable proportions, 
obtained by gently heating the carbonate with sulphur in covered 
vessels. It forms a liver-coloured mass. In the pharmacopoeia 
it is designated botassa sulphurate. 

Potassium sulphite, KjSOj, is prepared by saturating a potash 
solution with sulphur dioxide, adding a second equivalent of potash, 



200 



POTATO 



and crystallizing in a vacuum, when the salt separates as small 
deliquescent, hexagonal crystals. The salt K2S03-H20 may be 
obtained by crystallizing the metabisulphite, Kj^Oe (from sulphur 
dioxide and a hot saturated solution of the carbonate, jor from 
sulphur dioxide and a mixture of milk of lime and potassium sul- 
phate) with an equivalent amount of potash. The salt K 2 S03"2HjO 
is obtained as oblique rhombic octahedra by crystallizing the 
solution over sulphuric acid. On the isomeric potassium sodium 
sulphites see Sulphur. 

Potassium sulphate, K2SO4, a salt known early in the 14th century, 
and studied by Glauber, Boyle and Tachenius, was styled in the 
17th century arcanum or sal duplication, being regarded as a com- 
bination of an acid salt with an alkaline salt. It was obtained as 
a by-product in many chemical reactions, and subsequently used 
to be extracted from kainite, one of the Stassfurt minerals, but the 
process is now given up because the salt can be produced cheaply 
enough from the chloride by decomposing it with sulphuric acid 
and calcining the residue. To purify the crude product it is dis- 
solved in hot water and the solution filtered and allowed to cool, 
when the bulk of the dissolved salt crystallizes out with character- 
istic promptitude. The very beautiful (anhydrous) crystals have 
the habit of a double six-sided pyramid, but really belong to the 
rhombic system. They are transparent, very hard and absolutely 
permanent in the air. They have a bitter, salty taste. The salt 
is soluble in water, but insoluble in caustic potash of sp. gr. 1-35, 
and in absolute alcohol. It fuses at 1078 . The crude salt is used 
occasionally in the manufacture of glass. The acid sulphate or 
bisulphate, KHSO4, is readily produced by fusing thirteen parts 
of the powdered normal salt with eight parts of sulphuric acid. 
It forms rhombic pyramids, which melt at 197 . It dissolves in 
three parts of water of o° C. The solution behaves pretty much 
as if its two congeners, KjSCh and H2SO4, were present side by 
side of each other uncombined. An excess of alcohol, in fact, 
precipitates normal sulphate (with little bisulphate) and free acid 
remains in solution. Similar is the behaviour of the fused dry 
salt at a dull red heat; it acts on silicates, titanates, &c, as if it 
were sulphuric acid raised beyond its natural boiling point. Hence 
its frequent application in analysis as a disintegrating agent. For 
the salts of other sulphur acids, see Sulphur. 

Potassamide, NH2K, discovered by Gay-Lussac and Thenard 
in 1871, is obtained as an olive green or brown mass by gently heat- 
ing the metal in ammonia gas, or as a white, waxy, crystalline 
mass when the metal is heated in a silver boat. It decomposes 
in moist air, or with water, giving caustic potash and ammonia, 
in the latter case with considerable evolution of heat. On strong 
heating Tithesley (Journ. Chetn. Soc, 1894,^ 511) found that it 
decomposed into its elements. For the nitrite, see Nitrogen, 
for the nitrate see Saltpetre and for the cyanide see Prussic 
Acid; for other salts see the articles wherein the corresponding 
acid receives treatment. 

Analysis, &c. — All volatile potassium compounds impart a 
violet coloration to the Bunsen flame, which is masked, however, 
if sodium be present. The emission spectrum shows two lines, 
Ka, a double line towards the infra-red, and K/3 in the violet. 
The chief insoluble salts are the perchlorate, acid-tartrate and 
platinochloride. The atomic weight was determined by Stas and 
more recently by T. W. Richards and A. Stahler, who obtained 
the value 39*114 from analyses of the chloride, and by Richards 
and E. Meuller, who obtained the values 39*1135 and 39-1143 from 
analyses of the bromide (see Abs. J. C. S. t 1907, h\ 615). 

Medicine. 

Pharmacology. — Numerous salts and preparations of potassium 
are used in medicine; viz. Potassii Carbonts (salt of tartar), dose 
5 to 20 grs., from which are made (a) Potassii Bicarbonas, dose 5 to 
;o grs.; (6) Potassa Caustica, a powerful caustic not used internally. 
r rom caustic potash are made (1) Potassii Permanganas, dose 
1 to 3 grs., used in preparing Liquor Potassii Permanganatis, a 
1 % solution, dose 2 to a drs. (2) Potassii Iodidum, dose 5 to 20 
grs. ; from this are made trie Linamentum Potassii Iodidi cum sapone, 
strength 1 in 10, and the Unguentum Potassii Iodidi, strength 
1 in 10. (3) Potassii Bromidum, dose 5 to 30 grs. (4) Liquor 
Potassae,. strength 27 grs. of caustic potash to the oz. Potassii 
Citras, dose 10 to 40 grs. Potassii Acetas, dose 10 to 60 grs. 
Potassii (Moras, dose 5 to 15 grs., from which is made a lozenge, 
Trochiscus Potassii Chloratis, each containing 3 grs. Potassii 
Tartras Acidus (cream of tartar), dose 20 to 60 grs., which has 
a subpreparation Potassii Tartras, dose 30 to 60 grs. Potassii 
Nitras (saltpetre), dose 5 to 20 grs. Potassii Sulphas, dose 10 to 
40 grs.- Potassii Bichromas, dose A to | gr. 

Toxicology. — Poisoning by caustic potash may take place or 
poisoning by pearl ash containing caustic potash. A caustic taste 
in the mouth is quickly followed by burning abdominal pain, 
vomiting and diarrhoea, with a feeble pulse and a cold clammy 
skin; the post-mortem appearances are those of acute gastro- 
intestinal irritation. The treatment is washing out the stomach or 
giving emetics followed by vinegar or lemon juice and later oil and 
white of egg. 

Therapeutics. — Externally: Caustic potash is a most powerful 
irritant and caustic; it is used with lime in making Vienna paste, 



F 



which is occasionally used to destroy morbid growths. Liquor 
potassae is also used in certain skin diseases. The permanganate 
of potash is an irritant if used pure. Its principal action is as an 
antiseptic and disinfectant. If wet it oxidizes the products of 
decomposition. It is used in the dressing of foul ulcers. The 1 % 
solution is an antidote for snake-bite. 

Internally: Dilute solutions of potash, like other alkalis, are 
used to neutralize the poisonous effects of strong acids. In the 
stomach potassium saltS t neutralize the gastric acid, and hence 
small doses are useful in hypcrchloridia. Potassium salts are 
strongly diuretic, acting directly on the renaj epithelium. They 
arc quickly excreted in the urine, rendering it alkaline and thus 
more able to hold uric acid in solution. They also hinder the forma- 
tion of uric acid calculi. The acetate and the citrate are valuable 
mild diuretics in Bright's disease and in feverish conditions, and 
by increasing the amount of urine diminish the pathological fluids 
in pleuritic effusion, ascites, &c. In tubal nephritis they aid the 
excretion of fatty casts. The tartrate and acid tartrate are also 
diuretic in their action and, as well as the sulphate, are valuable 
hydragoguc saline purgatives. Potassium nitrate is chiefly used 
to make nitre paper, which on burning emits fumes useful in the 
treatment of the asthmatic paroxysm t> Lozenges of potassium 
chlorate are used in stomatitis, tonsilitis and pharyngitis, it can 
also be used in a gargle, 10 grs. to 1 fl. oz. of water. Its thera- 
peutic action is said to be due to nascent oxygen given off, so it 
is local in its action. In large doses it is a dangerous poison, con- 
verting the oxy haemoglobin of the blood into methaemoglobin. 
Internally the permanganate is a valuable antidote in opium 
poisoning. The action of potassium bromide and potassium 
iodide has been treated under bromine and iodine (q.v.). All potas- 
sium salts if taken in large doses are cardiac depressants, they 
also depress the nervous system, especially the brain and spinal 
cord. Like all alkalis if given in quantities they increase metabolism. 

. POTATO (Solatium tuberosum) , a well-known plant which 
owes its value to the peculiar habit, of developing underground 
slender leafless shoots or branches which differ in character and 
office from the true roots, and gradually swelling at the free end 
produce the tubers (potatoes) which are the common vegetable 
food. The nature of these tubers is further rendered evident 
by the presence of " eyes " or leaf -buds, which in due time 
lengthen into shoots and form the haulm or stems of the plant. 
Such buds are not, under ordinary circumstances, formed on 
roots. The determining cause of the formation of the tubers 
is not certainly known, but Professor Bernard has suggested 
that it is the presence of a fungus, Fusarium 'solanij which, 
growing in the underground shoots, irritates them and causes 
the swelling; the result is that an efficient method of propagation 
is secured independently of the seed. Starch and other matters 
are stored up in the tubers, as in a seed, and are.rendered avail- 
able for the nutrition of the young shoots. When grown under 
natural circumstances the tubers are relatively small and close 
to the surface of the soil, or even lie upon it. In the latter case 
they become green and have an acrid taste, which renders them 
unpalatable to human beings, and as poisonous qualities are 
produced similar to those of many Solanaceae they are unwhole- 
some. Hence the recommendation to keep the tubers in cellars 
or pits, not exposed to the light. Among the nine hundred 
species of Solatium less than a dozen have this property of 
forming tubers, but similar growths are formed at the ends of 
the shoots of the common bramble, of Convolvulus septum , of 
Helianthus luberosus, the so-called Jerusalem artichoke, of 
Sagittaria, and other plants. Tubers are also sometimes formed 
on aerial branches, as in some Aroids, Begonias, &c. The 
production of small green tubers on the haulm, in the axils of 
the leaves of the potato, is not very unfrequent, and affords an 
interesting proof of the true morphological nature of the under- 
ground shoots and tubers. This phenomenon follows injury 
to the phloem in the lower parts of the stem, preventing the 
downward flow of elaborated sap. The injury may be due to 
gnawing insects, and particularly to the fungus Corticium vagum, 
var. Solani (Rhizoctonia). 

The so-called fir-cone potatoes, which are elongated and 
provided with scales at more or less regular intervals, show also 
very clearly that the tuber is only a thickened branch with 
" eyes " set in regular order, as in an ordinary shoot. The 
potato tuber consists mainly of a mass of cells filled with starch 
and encircled by a thin corky rind. A few vessels and woody 
fibres traverse the tubers.

The chief value of the potato as an article of diet consists in 
the starch it contains, and to a less extent in the potash and other 
salts. The quantity of nitrogen in its composition is small, 
and hence it should not be relied on to constitute the staple 
article of diet. Letheby gives the following as the average

analyses, however, the starch is put as low as 13*30, and the 
nitrogenous matter as 0-92 (Deherain, Cours de chimie agricole, 
p. 159). Boussingault gives 25-2% of starch and 3% of nitro- 
genous matter. Warington states that the proportion of 
nitrogenous to non-nitrogenous matter in the digestible part 
of potatoes is as 1 to io-6. The composition Of the tubers 
evidently varies according to season, soils, manuring, the variety 
grown, &c, but the figures cited will give a sufficiently accurate 

»idea of it. The " ash " contains on the average of thirty-one 
analyses as much as 59*8% of potash, and 19*1% of phosphoric 
acid, the other ingredients being in very minute proportion. 
Where, as in some parts of northern Germany, the potato is 
grown for the purpose of manufacturing spirit great attention 
is necessarily paid to the quantitative analysis of the starchy and 
saccharine matters, which are found to vary much in particular 
varieties, irrespective of the conditions under which they are 
grown. 

It is to the Spaniards that we owe this valuable esculent. 
The Spaniards met with it in the neighbourhood of Quito, 
where it was cultivated by the natives. In the Cronica de Peru 
of Pedro Cieca (Seville, 1553), as well as in other Spanish books 
of about the same date, the potato is mentioned under the 
name " battata " or " papa." Hieronymus Cardan, a monk, 
is supposed to have been the first to introduce it from Peru into 
Spain, from which country it passed into Italy and thence into 
Belgium. Carl Sprengel, cited by Professor Edward Morren 
in his biographical sketch entitled Charles de I'Escluse, sa vie 
el ses ceuvresj states that the potato was introduced from Santa 
Fe into England by John Hawkins in 1563 {Garten Zeitung, 
1805, p. 346). If this be so, it is a question whether the English 
and not the Spaniards are not entitled to the credit of the first 
introduction; but, according to Sir Joseph Banks, the plant 
brought by Drake and Hawkins was not the common English 
potato but the sweet potato. 

In 1587 or 1588 De l'Escluse (Clusius) received the plant 
from Philippe de Sivry, lord of Waldheim and governor of Mons, 
who in his turn received it from some member of the suite of 
the papal legate. At the discovery of America, we are told by 
Humboldt, the plant was cultivated in all the temperate parts 
of the continent from Chile to Colombia, but not in Mexico. 
In 1585 or 1586, potato tubers were brought from what is now 
North Carolina to Ireland on the return of the colonists sent out 
by Sir Walter Raleigh, and were first cultivated on Sir Walter's 
estate near Cork. The tubers introduced under the auspices 
of Raleigh were thus imported a few years later than those 
mentioned by Clusius in 1588, which must have been in cultiva- 
tion in Italy and Spain for some years prior to that time. The 
earliest representation of the plant is to be found in Gerard's 
Herbal , published in 1597. The plant is mentioned under the 
name Papus orbicularis in the first edition of the Catalogus 
of the same author, published in 1596, and again in the second 
edition, which was dedicated to Sir Walter Raleigh (1599). 
It is, however, in the Herbal that we find the first description of 
the potato, accompanied by a woodcut sufficiently correct to 
leave no doubt whatever as to the identity of the plant. In 
this work (p. 781) it is called " Battata virginiana sive Virginia- 
norum, et Pappus, Potatoes of Virginia.' ' 

The " common potatoes " of which Gerard speaks are the 
tubers of Ipomoea Batatas, the sweet potato, which nowadays 
would not in Great Britain be spoken of as common. A second 



edition of the Herbal was published in 1636 by Thomas Johnson, 
with a different illustration from that given in the first edition, 
and one which in some respects, as in showing the true nature 
of the tuber, is superior to the first. The phenomenon of growing 
out or " super-tubcration " is shown in this cut. 

Previous to this (in 1629) Parkinson, the friend and associate 
of Johnson, had published his Paradisus t in which (p. 517) he 
gives an indifferent figure of the potato under the name of Papas 
seu Batlalas Virginianorum, and adds details as to the method 
of cooking the tubers which seem to indicate that they were 
still luxuries. Chabraeus, who wrote in 1666, tells us that 
the Peruvians made bread from the tubers, which they called 
" chunno." He further tells us that by the natives Virginieae 
insulae the plant was called " openauk," and that it is now 
known in European gardens, but he makes no mention of its 
use as an esculent vegetable, and, indeed, includes it among 
" plantae malign ae et venenatae." Heriot (De Bry's Collection 
of Voyages), in his report on Virginia, describes a plant under 
the same name " with roots as large as a walnut and others much 
larger; they grow in damp soil, many hanging together as if 
fixed on ropes; they are good food either boiled or roasted." 
The plant (which is not a native of Virginia) was probably 
introduced there in consequence of the intercourse of the early 
settlers with the Spaniards. The cultivation of the potato 
in England * made but little progress, even though it was 
strongly urged by the Royal Society in 1663; and not much more 
than a century has elapsed since its cultivation on a large scale 
became general. 

Botanists are agreed that the only species in general cultivation 
in Great Britain is the one which Bauhin, in his Phytopinax, p. 89 
( x 596)i called Solatium tuberosum esculentum r a name adopted by 
Linnaeus (omitting thejast epithet), and employed by all^ botanical 
writers. This species is probably native in Chile, but it is very 
doubtful if it is truly wild farther north. Baker {Journ. Linn. 
Soc, 1884, xx. 489), has reviewed the tuber-bearing species of 
Solanum from a systematic point of view as well as from that of 
geographical distribution. ^ Out of^ twenty so-called species he con- 
siders six to be really distinct, while the others are merely synony- 
mous or trifling variations. The six admitted tuber-bearing species 
are S. tuberosum, S. Maglia, S. Commersoni, S. cardiophyUum, S. 
Jamesii and S. oxycarpum. 

S. tuberosum is, according to Mr Baker, a native not only of 
the Andes of Chile but also of those of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador 
and Colombia, also of the mountains of Costa Rica, Mexico and the 
south-western United States. It seems most probable, however, 
that some at least of the plants mentioned in the northern part 
of America are the descendants of cultivated forms. S. Maglia 
is a native of the Chilean coast as far sou th as the Chonos Archipelago, 
and was cultivated in the garden of the Horticultural Society at 
Chiswick in 1822, ^ being con- 
sidered by Sabine, in his paper 
on the native country of the 
wild potato, to be the true 
5. tuberosum and the origin of 
the cultivated forms. This 
species was also found by 
Darwin in Chile, and was con- 
sidered by him, as by Sabine 
before him, to be the wild 
potato. Baker refers to the 
plants figured by Sabine {Trans. 
Hort. Soc. Lond. v. 249) 
(fig. 1) as being without doubt 
S. Maglia, but A. de Candolle 
{Origine^ des Plantes cultivSes, 
p. 40) is equally^ emphatic in 
the opinion that it is S. tuber- 
osum. S. Commersoni occurs in 
Uruguay, Buenos Aires and the 
Argentine Republic, in rocky 
situations at a low level. Under 
the name of S. Ohrondii it has 
been introduced into western 
France, where it is not only 
hardy but produces abundance 
of tubers, which are palatable, 
but have a slightly acid taste.

little known but very distinct tuberous species from central 
Mexico. 1 

A review of the localities in which the presence of S. tuberosum 
and its tuber-bearing allies has been ascertained shows that, 
broadly, these varieties may be divided into mountainous and 
littoral. In either case they would not be subjected, at least 
in their growing season, to the same extremes of heat, cold and 
drought as plants growing on inland plains. Again, those forms 
growing at a high elevation would probably start into growth 
later in the season than those near the coast. The significance 
of these facts from a cultural point of view is twofold: for, 
while a late variety is desirable for culture in Great Britain, 
as ensuring more or less immunity from spring frost, it is, on 
the other hand, undesirable, because late varieties are more 
liable to be attacked by the potato disease (Phytopkthora 
infestans) which as a rule appears about the time when the 
earliest varieties are ready for lifting, but before the late varieties 
are matured. 

In cultivation the potato varies very greatly not only as to 
the season of its growth but also as to productiveness, the 
vigour and luxuriance of its foliage, the presence or relative 
absence of hairs, the form of the leaves, the size and colour of 
the flowers, &c. The tubers vary greatly in size, form and 
colour; gardeners divide them into rounded forms and long 
forms or " kidneys," and there are of course varieties inter- 
mediate in form. The colour of the rind, yellowish, brown 
or purple, furnishes distinctions, as does the yellow or white 
colour of the flesh. The colour of the eyes and their prominence 
or depression are relatively very constant characteristics. 
These variations have arisen chiefly through cross-breeding, 
though not entirely so, there being a few cases upon record of 
the production of " sports " from tubers that have become the 
parents of new varieties, but authentic cases of the sporting 
of tubers are few and far between. If, on the other hand, the 
true seeds of any of our cultivated varieties are sown, the 
seedlings show very wide variations from one another and from 
the parents. In this connexion it is very interesting to observe 
that Messrs Sutton of Reading find that the seedlings of many 
of the varieties of potato that occur spontaneously in different 
parts of America come quite true to type from seed. 

The potato thrives best in a rather light friable loam; and in thin 
sandy soils the produce, if not heavy, is generally of very good quality. 
Soils which are naturally wet and heavy, as well as those which 
are heavily manured, are not suitable. Indeed it is best, except 
when there is ample space, to grow only the earlier kinds in gardens. 
If the soil is of fair quality the less manure used upon it the better, 
unless it be soot or lime. Gypsum, bone-dust, superphosphate of 
lime and nitrate of soda may also be used, and wood ashes are 
advantageous if the soil contains much vegetable matter; but the 
best results are usually obtained when farmyard manure is supple- 
mented by artificials, not by using artificials alone. 

Potatoes are commonly propagated by planting whole^ tubers 
or by dividing the tubers, leaving to each segment or " set " one or 
two eyes or buds. The " sets " are then planted in rows at a distance 
varying from 15 in. to 3 ft., the distance being regulated by the 
height of the stems, and that between the sets varying from 6 to 
12 in., 8 in. being a good average space for garden crops, with 2 it. 
between the rows. The sets may be put in 6 in. deep. The planting 
of whole tubers instead of the cutsets usually gives a better return. 



1 Although these six are the only species admitted as such by 
Baker, it is well to note some of the varieties. The 5. etuberosum 
of Lindley, differing from the common S. tuberosum in not producing 
tubers, was found in Chile, and is probably not specifically distinct, 
although exceptional, for it is by no means very unusual to find 
even cultivated plants produce no tubers. 5. Fernandezianum is, 
according to Baker, a form of S. tuberosum, but if .so its habitat in 
the mountain woods of Juan Fernandez is climatically different 
from that in the dry mountains of central Chile, where the* true 
5. tuberosum grows. 5. otiles was found more recently by Andre* 
on the summit of Quindiu in Colombia, at a height of 11483 ft. 
It produces tubers of the size of a nut. S. Andreanum, found by 
Andr6 at Cauca (6234 ft.), was considered by the traveller to be the 
true 5. tuberosum, but this view is not shared by Baker, who named 
it after the discoverer. Its tubers, if it produces any, have not 
been seen. S. immite is probably only a slight variety of S. tubero- 
sum, as are also the Venezuelan S. colombianum, 5. verrucosum, S. 
demissum and 5. utile. S. Fendleri, a native of the mountains of 
New Mexico and Arizona, was considered by Asa Gray to be likewise 
a form of 5. tuberosum. 



The full-sized tubers are, however, preferable to smaller ones, as their 
larger buds tend to produce stronger shoots, and where cut sets are 
used the best returns are obtained from sets taken from the points 
of the tubers — not from their base. Thomas Dickson of Edinburgh 
long ago observed that the most healthy and productive crop was 
to be obtained by planting unripe tubers, and proposed this as a 
preventive of the disease called the ** curl/' which sometimes attacks 
the young stems, causing them and also the leaves to become 
crumpled, and few or no tubers to be produced; in this connexion 
it is interesting to notethat Scottish and Irish seed potatoes give a 
larger yield than English, probably on account of their being less 
matured. It has also been noted that the sprouting of the eyes 
of the potato may be accelerated if, while still unripe, it is taken up 
and exposed for some weeks to the influence of a scorching sun. 
The best sets are those obtained from plants grown in elevated 
and open situations, and it is also beneficial to use sets grown on a 
different soil. 

The earliest crops should, if possible, be planted in a light soil 
and in a warm situation, towards the end of February, or as early as 
possible in March. In some cases the tubers for early crops are 
sprouted on a hotbed, the plants being put out as soon as the leaves 
can bear exposure. 

The main crop should be planted by the middle of March, sprouted 
sets being used; late planting is very undesirable. Those in- 
tended for storing should be dug up as soon as they are fairly ripe, 
unless they are attacked by the disease, in which ease they must 
be taken up as soon as the murrain is observed ; or if they are then 
sufficiently developed to be worth preserving, but not fully ripe, 
the haulms or shaws should be pulledout, to prevent the fungus 
passing down them into the tubers; this may be done without dis- 
turbing the tubers, which can be dug afterwards. 

Forcing. — The earliest crop may be planted in December, and 
suceessional ones in January and February; the varieties specially 
suited for forcing being chosen. The mode of cultivation adopted 
by the London market gardeners is thus in substance explained by 
Cuthill: A long trench, 5 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep, is filled with hot 
dung, on which soil to the depth of 6 in. is put. The sets employed 
are middle-sized whole potatoes, which are placed close together 
over the bed, covered with 2 in. of mould, and then hooped and 
protected with mats and straw, under which conditions they will 
sprout in about a month. A bed of the requisite length (sometimes 
100 yds.) is then prepared of about 2 ft. thickness of hot dung, soil 
is put on to the depth of 8 in., and the frames set over all. The 
potatoes are then carefully taken up from the striking bed, all the 
shoots being removed except the main one, and they are planted 
4 in. deep, radishes being sown thinly over them and covered lightly 
with mould. When the haulm of the potato has grown to about 
6 in. in height the points are nipped off, in order to give the radishes 
fair play; and, although this may stop growth for a few days, still 
the potato crop is always excellent. After planting nothing more is 
required but to keep up the temperature to about 70 , admitting 
air when practicable, and giving water as required. The crop is 
not dug* up until it has come to maturity. 

Potatoes are also grown largely in hooped beds on a warm 
border in the open ground. The sets after having been sprouted, 
as above, are planted out in Januaryin trenches 2 ft. deep filled 
with hot dung, the sets being planted 5 in. deep, and over all radishes 
are sown. The ridges are then hooped over, allowing about 2 ft. 
of space in the middle, between the mould and the hoop, and are 
covered with mats and straw, but as soon as the radishes come up 
thej; are uncovered daily, and covered again every night as a pro- 
tection against possible frosts. This is continued till the potatoes 
are ready for digging in May. 

Potatoes are sometimes grown in pots in heat, sprouted sets being 
planted in 11-in. pots about two-thirds full of soil, and placed 
near the glass in any of the forcing-houses, where a temperature of 
from 65 ° to 70 is to be maintained. The plants are duly watered 
and earthed up as they advance in growth. 

Potato Diseases 

There are few agricultural subjects of greater importance 
than the culture of the potato and the losses entailed by potato 
disease. It is not unusual in bad seasons for a single grower 
to lose £30 per acre in one season. In extreme cases every 
tuber is lost, as the produce will not even pay the cost of 
lifting. 

The best-known disease of potatoes is caused by the growth 
of a fungus named Pkytophikora infestans, within the tissues 
of the host plant, and this fungus has the peculiar property of 
piercing and breaking up the cellular tissues and setting up 
putrescence in the course of its growth. The parasite, which 
has a somewhat restricted range of host plants, chiefly invades 
the potato, Solanum tuberosum-, the bittersweet, 5. Dulcamara, 
and other species of Solanum. It is also very destructive to 
the tomato, Ly coper sicum esculentum, and to all or nearly all

203 






the other species of Lycopersicum. At times it attacks petunias 
and even scrophulariaceous plants, as Anthocersis and Schiz- 
anthus. 

As a rule, although there are a few exceptions, the disease occurs 
wherever the potato is grown. It is known in South America in the 
home of the potato plant. In England the disease is generally 
first seen during the last ten days of July; its extension is greatly 
favoured by warm and showery weather. To the unaided eyethe 
disease is seen as purplish brown or blackish blotches of various 
sizes, at first on the tips and edges of the leaves, and ultimately 
upon the leaf-stalks and the larger stems. On gathering the 
foliage for examination, especially in humid weather, these 
dark blotches are seen to be putrid, and when the disease takes 
a bad form the dying leaves give out a highly offensive odour. The 
fungus, which is chiefly within the leaves and stems, seldom emerges 
through the firm upper surface of the leaf; it commonly appears 
as a white bloom or mildew on the circumference of the disease- 
patches on the under surface. It grows within the tissues from 
central spots towards an ever-extending circumference, carrying 
putrescence in its course. As the patches extend in size by the 
growth of the fungus they at length become confluent, and so the 
leaves are destroyed and an end is put to one of the chief vital 
functions of the host plant. On the destruction of the leaves the 
fungus either descends the stem by the interior or the spores are 
washed by the rain to the tubers in the ground. In either case the 
tubers are reached by the fungus or its spores, and so become diseased. 
The fungus is very small in size, and under the microscope appears 
slightly whitish or colourless. The highest powers are required to see 
all parts of the parasite. 

The accompanying illustration shows the habit and structure of 
the fungus. The letters A B show a vertical section through a frag- 
ment of a potato leaf, enlarged 100 diameters; A is the upper surface 
line, and B the lower ; the lower surface of the leaf is shown at the top,

the better to exhibit the nature of the fungus growths. Between 
A and B the loose cellular tissue of which the leaf is partly built 
up is seen in section, and at C the vertical palisade cells which give 
firmness to the upper surface of the leaf. Amongst the loose tissue 
of the leaf numerous transparent threads are shown; these are the 
mycelial threads or spawn of the fungus; wherever they touch 
the leaf -eel Is they pierce or break down the tissue, and so set up 
decomposition, as indicated by the darker shading. The lower 
surface of the potato leaf is furnished with numerous organs of 
transpiration or stomata, which are narrow orifices opening into 
the leaf and from which moisture is transpired in the form of 
vapour. Out of these small openings the fungus threads emerge, 
as shown at D, D, D. When the threads reach the air they branch 
in a tree-like manner, and each branch (sporangiophore) carries one 
or more ovate sporangia, as shown at E, E, E, which fall off and are 
carried by the wind. One is shown more highly magnified (400 
diameters) at F; the contained protoplasm breaks up into a definite 
number, of parts as at G, forming eight minute mobile 
bodies called " zoospores," each zoospore being furnished with two 



extremely attentuated vibrating hairs termed " cilia," as shown at H. 
These zoospores escape and swim about in any film of moisture, and 
on going to rest take a spherical form, germinate and produce 
threads of mycelium as at K. The sporangia may also germinate 
directly without undergoing division. The mycelium from the 
germinating sporangia or zoospores soon finds its way into the 
tissues of the potato leaf by the organs of transpiration, and the 
process of growth already described^ is repeated "over and 
over again till the entire potato leaf, or indeed the whole plant, is 
reduced to putridity. 

The germinating spores are not only able to pierce the leaves and 
stems of the potato plant, and so gain an entry to its interior through 
the epidermis, but they are also able to pierce the skin of the tuber, 
especially in young examples. It is therefore obvious that, if the 
tubers are exposed to the air where they are liable to become slightly 
cracked by the sun, wind, hail and rain, and injured by small animals 
and insects, the spores from the leaves will drop on to the tubers, 
quickly germinate upon the slightly injured places, and cause the 
potatoes to become diseased. Earthing up therefore prevents these 
injuries, but where practised to an immoderate extent it materially 
reduces the produce of tubers. The^ labour entailed in repeated 
earthing up is also considered a serious objection to its general 
adoption. 

The means of mitigating the damage done by this disease 
are (1) the selection of varieties found to resist its attacks; 
(2) the collection and destruction of diseased tubers so that none 
are left in the soil to become a menace to future crops; (3) care 
that no tubers showing traces of the disease are planted; (4) 
spraying with Bordeaux mixture at intervals from midsummer 
onwards. The last measure prevents the germination of the 
spores of the fungus on the leaves, and is a most useful mode of 
checking the spread of the disease; to be successful in its use, how- 
ever, entails care in the preparation of the spray and thorough- 
ness in its application. In spite of the many efforts in the direc- 
tion of obtaining a resistant variety no great measure of success 
has been attained. The earlier varieties of potato appear to 
escape the disease almost entirely, as they are usually ready to 
be lifted before it becomes troublesome; while certain of the later 
varieties are much less prone to it than the majority. They 
do not appear, however, to maintain the same degree of immunity 
over a long period of years, but to become more and more open 
to the attack as the variety becomes older; nor do they always 
exhibit the same degree of immunity in different localities. 
Something may be done to mitigate the loss arising from the 
disease by selecting comparatively immune varieties from time 
to time. 

Many ingenious attempts have been made to obtain a variety 
perfectly immune. Maule, thinking a hardier blood might be infused 
into the potato bv crossing it with some of the native species, raised 
hybrids between it and the two common species of Solanum native 
in this country, S. Dulcamara and S. nigrum, but the hybrids 
proved as susceptible as the potato itself. Maule also tried the effect 
of grafting the potato on these two specie's and, though he succeeded, 
there is no record to show whether the product was any hardier 
than the parents. Dean (Gard. Chron., Sept. 1876, p. 30a.) succeeded 
in grafting the potato on the tomato, and Messrs Sutton nave carried 
out similar experiments on an extensive scale (Journ. Roy. Hort. Soc. 
1899, xxiii. Proc. p. 20), but in no case have the variations produced 

C roved disease-proof. Various experimenters, especially Fenn, 
ave asserted that by engrafting an eye of one variety into the tuber 
of another, not only will adhesion take place but the new tubers will 
present great variety of character; this seems to be the case, but it 
can hardly be considered as established that the variations in ques- 
tion were the result of any commingling of the essences of the two 
varieties. The wound may simply have set up that variation in the 
buds the occasional existence of which has been already noted. 

It is possible that the hybridizing of the potato with one or other 
of the wild types of tuberous Solanums may give rise to a variety 
which shall be immune, though unfortunately most are themselves 
liable to the attacks of the fungus, and one of the few crosses so made 
between the common potato and Solanum Ma^lia has exhibited the 
same undesirable trait. The form cultivated in England for some 
time under the name Solanum tuberosum (which, however t> forms 
tubers and is probably not that known under this name by Lindley) 
seems so far to have escaped. In view of the fact that Biffen has 
proved that immunity from the attacks of a certain fungus in wheat 
is a transmissible recessive character reappearing in some of the 
individuals of the second generation, it would appear that there is 
great hope of securing an immune variety with tne aid of this form. 
It is possible, too, that continued cultivation in the rich soil of 
gardens may induce that tendency to vary when seedlings are 
raised that is so marked a feature of the potato of commerce, in one 
or more of the other species of tuberous Solanums.

Another fungus attacking the leaves is Macrosporium Solani 
(fig- 3)> but this attack usually comes earlier in the season 
than the foregoing. It is characterized by the curling of the 

leaves, which later show black 
spots due to the production of 
numerous dark spores in patches 
on the diseased leaves. The 
damage is often considerable, as 
the crop is greatly lessened by 
the interference with the func- 
tions of the leaf. The parasite 
may be held in check by spraying 
with Bordeaux mixture early in 
the season. The fungus passes 
the winter on pieces of leaf, &c, 
left on the ground. All such 
refuse should be cleared up and 
burned. A third fungus, Cerco- 
spora concorSj also forms spots 
on the leaves and may be kept 
in check by the same means.

disease is due to the presence of

tissues of the tuber. Tubers showing any trace of such a ring

should not be used for seed, and rotation of crops should be 
observed as a means of preventing the infection of the crop 
with the germ. Biting and sucking insects have been found to 
carry the bacilli from one plant to another. 

The tubers frequently show scurfy or scab-like spots upon their 
surface, thus greatly depreciating their value for market purposes. 
The fungus, Sorosporium scabies, which is the cause of the scab, 
does not penetrate into the flesh of the tuber, nor detract from its 
edible properties. Excess of lime in the soil is said to favour 
the development of the fungus. Similar spots are produced on 
potatoes in America by the fungus Oospora scabies ; and in both cases, 
if affected " seed " potatoes are steeped in a solution of \ pint 
formalin in 15 gallons of water for two hours before planting, the 
attack on the resulting crop is materially lessened. The fungus, 
Oedomyces leproides, produces large, blackish, irregular warts which 
sometimes involve the whole surface of the tuber. This disease is 
of recent introduction into Great Britain, but bids fair to be- 
come very troublesome. The spores of the fungus pass the 
winter in the soil and the delicate mycelium attacks the young 
shoots in the summer. These become brown, finally blackish 
and greatly contorted until a. large scab is formed on the developing 
tuber, whence the name by which the disease is known — li black 
scab." Diseased potatoes left in the soil and even slightly diseased 
" sets " are a source of infection of succeeding crops. Rotation must 
be observed and no diseased sets planted. 

The rotting of tubers after lifting may be due to various causes, 
but the infection of the tubers by the Phytofhthora already men- 
tioned is a frequent source of this trouble, while " Winter Rot " is 
due to the fungus Nectria Solani. This fungus finds conditions 
suitable for^ growth when the potatoes are stored in a damp con- 
dition; rotting from this cause rarely occurs when they are dried 
before being placed in heaps. The first signs of this fungus is the 
appearance of small white tufts of mycelium bursting through 
the skin of the tuber, the spores of the fungus being carried at the 
tips of the threads forming these tufts. This form of fruit is suc- 
ceeded by others which have received different names, and lastly 
by the mature Nectria which forms minute red flask-shaped pen- 
thecia on parts of the rotted potatoes that have dried up. The 
intermediate forms are known as Monosporium, Fusarium and 
Cephalosporin™. The pieces of dried-up potato with the spores 
of Nectria upon them are a source of infection in the succeeding year, 
and care should be taken that diseased tubers are not planted. 
Flowers of sulphur plentifully sprinkled over the potatoes before 
storing has been found to check the spread of the rot in the heap. 

POTATO RACK, a running contest, where the winner is the 
first who collects in a basket or other receptacle a number of 
potatoes, usually eight, placed, as a rule two yards apart, along 
a straight line, and then crosses a finish line five or ten yards 
farther on. 

POTATO WAR (Kartojfelkrieg), the name given by the Prus- 
sians to the War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778-79. The 
Prussians and a Saxon contingent, commanded by Frederick 
the Great and his brother Prince Henry, were opposed to two 
Austrian armies under Loudon and Lacy. The operations 
consisted almost entirely of manoeuvres which had for their 
object the obtaining or the denial to the enemy of food-supplies. 
The war thus acquired the name of Kartojfelkrieg. Its duration 
was from the 3rd of July 1778 to the assembly of the congress 
of Teschen on the 10th of March i77Q,andits total cost £4,350,000 
and 20,000 men to all parties. The war may be studied from 
the military point of view as an extreme example of what 
Clausewitz calls " war with a restricted aim." 

POTAWATOMI (properly Potewalmik, fire-makers, in 
allusion to their secession from the Ojibway, and their establish- 
ment of a separate council-fire), a tribe of North-American 
Indians of Algonquian stock. When first known (about 1670), 
they lived around Green Bay, Wisconsin. They subsequently 
moved south and eventually settled in lower Michigan. They 
were allied with the French in their wars against the Iroquois 
and took part in the conspiracy of Pontiac (q.v.). In the War of 
Independence they fought for England, as also in that of 1812. 
In 1846 most of them were removed to a reservation in Kansas. 
Of these the majority have abandoned their tribal relations 
and become citizens. Others are in Wisconsin and the 
bulk in Oklahoma. They now number some 2500.

above its junction with the Vaal. The streets are lined with 
fine willow trees, and there are public grounds in which are 
nurseries and a showyard. Golf links add to the attractions 
of the place, which is one of the healthiest in the Transvaal. 
In the neighbourhood arc gold-mines; the reef appearing to be 
a continuation of the Witwatersrand reefs. The Vaal river 
gofdfields, of which Venterskroon is the centre, arc 16 to 20 m. 
south-east of Potchcfstroom. 

Potchcfstroom was founded in November 1838 by Hcndrik 
Potgietcr, and is the oldest town in and first capital of 
the Transvaal. In 1862 it was the scene of civil war between 
rival Boer factions. In 1880-81 the garrison camped outside 
the town was besieged by Boers under Commandant P. A. 
Cronje. The British troops (250 in number) were confined to 
a fort 25 yds. square and lost over a third of their strength 
in killed and wounded before they surrendered on the 21st of 
March, the investment having begun on the 18th of December 
1880. Charges of treachery ' were brought against Cronje for 
failing to notify, the besieged that an armistice had been agreed 
to by the Boer leaders. Of this armistice Colonel R. W. C. 
Winsloc, who was in command of the British, became aware 
before the surrender took place. On the suggestion of Com- 
mandant General Joubert the capitulation was considered as 
cancelled and a detachment of British troops reoccupied the 
town until the conclusion of peace. In the Anglo-Boer War of 
1899-1902 Potehefstroom was occupied by the British without 
opposition. (See Transvaal: History.) 

POTEMKIN, GRIGORY ALEKSANDROVICH, Prince 
(1 730-1 791), Russian statesman, was born at Chizheva near 
Smolensk. He was educated at the Moscow University, and 
in 1755 entered the " Reiter " of the Horse Guards. His 
participation in the coup d'Stat of the 8th of July 1762 attracted 
the attention of the new empress, Catherine II., who made him 
a Kammerjunker and gave him a small estate. The biographical 
anecdotes relating to him during the next few years are obscure 
and mostly apocryphal. In 1768 he quitted the Guards and 
was attached to the court as a Kammerkerr, but in 1769 he 
volunteered for the Turkish War and distinguished himself 
at Khotin, Focshani and Larga, besides routing the Turks 
at Olta. It was not till 1771 that he became Catherine's prime 
favourite. In that year he was made an adjutant-general, 
lieutenant-colonel of the Preobrazhensky Guards, a member of 
the council of state, and, in the words of a foreign contemporary 
diplomatist, " the most influential personage in Russia." 
Somewhat later he was created a count, and appointed com- 
mander-in-chief and governor-general of " New Russia," as the 
conquered provinces in the Ukraine were then called. In 1776, 
at Catherine's request, the emperor Joseph II. raised Potemkin 
to the rank of a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1775 
he was superseded in the empress's graces by Zavadovsky; 
but the relations between Catherine and her former lover 
continued to be most friendly, and his influence with her was 
never seriously disturbed by any of her subsequent favourites. 
A whole mass of facts testify to the enormous and extraordinary 
influence of Potemkin during the next ten years. His corre- 
spondence with the empress was uninterrupted. The most 
important state documents passed through his hands. Catherine 
loaded him with gifts. He was deeply interested in the question 
of the southern boundaries of Russia and consequently in the 
fate of the Turkish Empire. It was be who, in 1776, sketched 
the plan for the conquest of the Crimea which was subsequently 
realized; and about the same period he was busy with the so- 
called " Greek project," which aimed at restoring the Byzantine 
Empire under one of Catherine's grandsons. In many of the 
Balkan states he had well-informed agents. After he became 
field marshal, in 1784, he introduced many reforms into the army, 
and built a fleet in the Black Sea, which, though constructed 
of very bad materials, did excellent service in Catherine's 
second Turkish War (1787-92). His colonizing system was 
exposed to very severe criticism, yet it Is impossible not to 
admire the results of his stupendous activity. The arsenal of 
Kherson, begun in 1778, the harbour of Sevastopol and the 



new fleet of fifteen liners and twenty-five smaller vessels, were 
monuments of his genius. But there was exaggeration in all 
he attempted. He spared neither men, money, nor himself 
in attempting to carry out his gigantic scheme for the coloniza- 
tion of the south Russian steppes; but he never calculated the 
cost, and more than three-quarters of the design bad to be 
abandoned when but half finished. Catherine's famous expedi- 
tion to the south in 1787 was a veritable triumph for Potemkin; 
for he contrived to conceal all the weak points of his administra- 
tion and to present everything in a rose-coloured light. On 
this occasion he received the title of prince of Tauris. The 
same year the second Turkish 'War began, and the founder of 
New Russia took upon himself the responsibilities of commander- 
in-chief. But the army was ill-equipped and unprepared; and 
Potemkin in an hysterical fit of depression gave everything up 
for lost, and would have resigned but for the steady encourage- 
ment of the empress. Only after Suvarov had valiantly 
defended Kinburn did he take heart again, and besiege and 
capture Ochakov and Bender. In 1 790 he conducted the military 
operations on the Dniester and held his court at Jassy with 
more than Asiatic pomp. . In 1791 he returned to St Petersburg 
where, along with his friend Bezborodko (g.v.), he made vain 
efforts to overthrow the new favourite, Zubov, and in four 
months spent 850,000 roubles in banquets and entertainments, 
a sum subsequently reimbursed to him from the treasury. Then 
the empress grew impatient and compelled him (1791) to return 
to Jassy to conduct the peace negotiations as chief Russian 
plenipotentiary. On the 5th of October, while on his way to 
Nikolayev, he died in the open steppe, 40 m. from Jassy, in con- 
sequence of eating a whole goose while in a high state of fever. 

Very various are the estimates of Potemkin. Neither during 
his life nor after his death did any two people agree about him. 
The German pamphlet: Pansalim Fiirst der Finsterniss und 
seine Geliebte, published in 1 794, is a fair specimen of the opinion 
of those who regarded him as the evil genius of Catherine and 
of Russia. But there were many, including the empress herself, 
who looked upon him as a man of manifold and commanding 
genius. He was indubitably the most extraordinary of all the 
Catherinian favourites. He was an able administrator, but 
wanting in self-control. Licentiousness, extravagance and an 
utter disregard for human life were his weak points, but he was 
loyal, generous and magnanimous. Nearly all the anecdotes 
related of him by Helbig, in the biography contributed by him 
to the journal Minerva (1 797-1800), and freely utilized by later 
biographers, are absolutely worthless.

POTENTILLA (nat. order Rosaceae, q.v.) t a border and rock- 
garden plant. Many of the species bear brilliantly coloured 
flowers and graceful foliage. A soil of a good loamy staple, 
enriched with rotten dung, will grow the potentilla to perfection. 
Potentillas may be increased, though not very freely, by parting 
them into as many pieces as there are crowns, the side growths 
being those which can usually be thus separated. This may 
be done in autumn or spring, and the plants will generally 
bloom' the following season. The species and some of the 
varieties reproduce true from seed, and are readily increased 
by that means. ,The following are some of the best kinds: 
aurea, atrosanguinea, davurka, formosa, nilida, n. airo-rubra, 
speciosa t tridentata and villosa. 

POTENTIOMETER, an instrument for the measurement of 
electromotive force and also of difference of electric potential 
between two points. The term potentiometer is usually applied 
to an instrument for the measurement of steady or continuous 
potential difference between two points in terms of the potential 
difference of the terminals of a standard voltaic cell of some 
kind, such as a Clark or Weston cell. The modern potentio- 
meter has been developed out of an arrangement due to J. C. 
Poggendorff, employed also by J. Latimer Clark, but converted 



2o6 



POTENTIOMETER 



into its modern direct reading form by J. A. Fleming in 1885 
(see Ittdustries, 1886, i. 152). In principle the modern potentio- 
meter consists of an arrangement by means of which any 
potential difference not exceeding a certain assigned value 
can be compared with that of a standard cell having a known 
electromotive force. In simplest form it consists of a long, 
straight, fine, uniform wire stretched over a divided scale. The 
ends of this wire are connected to one or more secondary 
cells of constant electromotive force, a variable resistance being 
interposed so as to regulate the current flowing through the 
fine wire. To one end of this fine wire is attached one terminal 
of a sensitive galvanometer. Sliding contacts can be moved 
along the fine wire into any position. Supposing that the 
scale under this wire is divided into 2000 parts and that we 
are in possession of a standard Clark cell, the electromotive 
force being known at various temperatures, and equal, say, to 
i*434 vo l ts a t 1 5° C. The first process is to set the potentio- 
meter. The slider is placed so as to touch the fine wire at 
division No. 1434 on the fine wire, and the Clark cell is connected 
in between the sliding contact and one terminal of the galvano- 
meter, so that its negative pole is connected through the galvano- 
meter with that end of the fine wire to which the negative pole 
of the working battery is attached. The resistance in circuit 
with the fine wire is then altered until the galvanometer shows no 
deflexion. We then know that the fall of potential down the 
2000 divisions of the fine wire must be exactly 2 volts. If 
then we substitute for the standard cell any other source of 
electromotive force, we can move the slider into another position 
in which the galvanometer will show no deflection. The scale 
reading then indicates directly the electromotive force of this 
second source of potential. Thus, for instance, if an experiment 
were made with a Leclanche cell, and if the balancing-point 
were found to be at 1500 divisions on the scale, the electromotive 
force would be determined as 1*500 volts. Instead of adjusting 
in this manner the electromotive force of any form of cell, 
if we pass any constant current through a known resistance 
and bring wires from the extremities of that resistance into 
connexion with the slider and the galvanometer terminal, we 
can in the same way determine the fall of potential down the 
above resistance in terms of the electromotive force of the 
standard cell and thus measure the current flowing through 
the standard resistance. 

In the practical form the potentiometer wire is partly replaced 
by a number of coils of wire, say 14 (see fig. 1), and the potentio- 
meter wire itself has a resistance equal to one of these coils. One 
terminal of the galvanometer can then be shifted to the junction

between any pair of consecutive coils and the slider shifted to any 
point on the potentiometer wire. By such an arrangement the 
potential difference can be measured of any amount from o to 1*5 
volts. In some cases the potentiometer wire is wholly replaced 
by a series of coils divided into small subdivisions. We may 
employ such a potentiometer to measure large potential difference 
greater than the electromotive force of the working battery, as 
Follows: The two points between which the potential difference is 
required are connected by high resistance, say of 100,000 ohms or 
more, and from the extremities of a known fraction of this resistance, 
say, 1/100 or 1/1000 or 1/10,000 wires are brought to the potentio- 
meter and connected in between the slider and the corresponding 
galvanometer terminal. We can thus measure as described the 
drop in volts down a known fraction of the whole high resistance and 
therefore calculate the fall in potential down the whole of the high 
resistance, which is the potential difference required. The potentio- 
meter and the divided resistance constitute a sort of electrical 



scaleyard by means of which any electromotive force or difference of 
potential can be compared with the electromotive force of a standard 
cell. Very convenient and practical forms of potentiometer have 
been devised by Crompton (fig. 2), Nalder, Elliot Bros., Flemings

A, B, C, D, E, F, Terminals to which standard cell or voltages to be 

tested are attached, 
and others. An essential accompaniment therefore of the potentio- 
meter is a series of standard low resistances, say of o-i, o-oi, o-ooi 
ohm, and also a series of higher resistances divided into known 
fractions. In practical work, the low resistances take the form of 
certain strips of metal which have on them two pairs of terminals, 
one termed " current terminals," and the other " potential ter- 
minals." These resistance strips, as they are called, are carefully 
adjusted so that the resistance between the potential terminals 
has a known low value. In order to measure the value of a con- 
tinuous electric current, and therefore to calibrate any^ amperemeter 
we proceed as follows: The amperemeter is placed in series with 
a suitable low resistance strip, say of o-oi ohm. From the potential 
terminals of the strip, wires are brought to the potentiometer so^ as 
to determine their potential difference in terms of the electromotive 
force of the standard Clark cell. An observation is then^ taken 
of the reading of the amperemeter and of the fall of resistance 
down the low resistance when a certain steady current is passing 
through the strip and amperemeter. Supposing that the potential 
fall down the strip is found to be '081 volt, the strip difference having 
a resistance of o-i ohm, it would be seen that the current passing 
through the strip was 98-1 amperes. If then the amperemeter scale 
reading was 100 it would show an error of that scale reading oi 
minus 1*9 amperes or nearly 2 %. In the same manner the potentio- 
meter may be used to calibrate a voltmeter by the aid of a divided 
resistance of known value. 

In electrical measurements connected with incandescent electric 
lamps the potentiometer is of great use, as it enables us to make 
accurately and nearly simultaneously two measurements, one of 
the current through the lamp and the other of the potential differ- 
ence of the terminals. For this purpose a resistance, say, of one 
ohm is placed in series with the lamp and a resistance of 100,000 
ohms placed across the terminals of the lamp; the latter resistance 
is divided into two parts, one consisting of 1000 ohms and the other 
of 99,000 ohms. The potentiometer enables us to measure therefore 
the current through the lamp by measuring the drop in volts down a 
resistance in series with it and the potential difference of the ter- 
minals of the lamp by measuring the drop in volts down the 100th 
part of the high resistance of 100,000 ohms connected across the 
terminals of the lamp. 

Standard Cells. — A necessary adjunct to the potentiometer is 
some form of standard cell to be used as a standard of electromotive 
force. In the case of the Clark standard cell above mentioned the 
elements are mercury and zinc separated by a paste of mercurous 
sulphate mixed with a saturated solution of zinc sulphate. Other 
voltaic standards of electromotive force are in use, such as the Weston 
cadmium cell, the Helmholtz calomel cell, and the standard Daniell 
cell. The Clark cell is made in two forms, the board of trade or 
tubular form, and the H form of cell devised by Lord Rayleigh. 
The German experts seem to favour the latter form; the specifica- 
tion issued by the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt of Berlin 
may be found in the Electrician, xxxi. 265-266. The electromotive 
force of the cell diminishes with rise of temperature, the board of 
trade value being 1 -434 volts at i5°C. 1 and 1-434 (1-0-00077 (/-15)) 
volts at t° C. A more exact expression is obtained if instead of 
0-00077 the quantity 0-00078+0-000017 (/ — 15) is used. In the 
Weston standard cell cadmium and cadmium sulphate are substi- 
tuted for zinc and zinc sulphate; it has the advantage of a much 
smaller coefficient of temperature variation than the Clark cell. 
It is most conveniently made up in a glass vessel of H form, pure 
mercury and cadmium amalgam bei ng the two elements (fig. 3), 

1 According to K. Kahle and W. Wien, the electromotive force of 
the H form of Clark cell is 1-4322 volts at 15 C.

After the platinum wires have been sealed through the glass, a 

little aqua regia is placed in the cell legs until bubbles of gas arise 

from the platinum, when it 
is thrown out and replaced 
by a solution of mercurous 
nitrate. Then, by the use of 
another piece of platinum as 
anode, mercury is electro- 
lytically deposited upon the 

Clatinum, which may also 
e amalgamated by making 
it white hot in a Bunscn 
flame and plunging it in 
mercury. To prepare the 
cadmium amalgam, one part 
of pure cadmium is dissolved 
in six parts of pure mercury, 
and the product while warm 
and fluid is placed in one 
limb of the cell and warmed, 
to ensure perfect contact with 
the platinum wire. The cad- 
mium sulphate solution _ is 
prepared by digesting a saturated solution of cadmium sulphate with 
cadmium hydroxide to remove free acid, care being taken not to raise 
the temperature above 70 C, and then by digesting it still further 
with mercurous sulphate until no more precipitation occurs. The 
cadmium sulphate solution must be saturated and have free crystals 
of the salt in it. The mercurous sulphate must be free from acid, 
and made neutral by trituration with finely divided mercury. In 
making the paste, so much cadmium sulphate must be added that a 
saturated solution of that salt is formed and is present in the cell. 
The cell has the electromotive force above stated if the amalgam 
of cadmium has from 6 to 13 parts of mercury to 1 of cadmium. 
The German investigators seem to have a great preference for the 
H form of cell, but it is clear that a narrow tubular cell of the British 
board of trade form not only comes more quickly to the temperature 
of the water bath in which it is placed, but is more certain to be 
wholly at one temperature. In a modification of the H form devised 
by F. E. Smith, of the National Physical Laboratory (PhiL Trans., 
A, 207, pp. 393-420), a contraction formed in the side of the vertical 
tube tends to hold the contents in place. Fig. 4 shows this cell, 
hermetically sealed, mounted in a brass case. 

In cases when great accuracy is not required, a Danicll cell can 
be used as a standard of electromotive force. The form designed 

by J. A. Fleming {PhiL Mag., 20, 
p. 126) consists of a U tube, one 
leg of which contains a rod of pure 
amalgamated zinc, and the other a 
rod of freshly electrotyped copper. 
The legs are filled with solutions of 
zinc sulphate and copper sulphate, 
the zinc rod being in the # zinc 
sulphate and the copper rod in the 
copper sulphate. When so made, 
the cell has an electromotive force 
of 1-072 volts and no sensible 
temperature variation. The solu- 
tions are made by dissolving the 
purest recrystallized sulphate of 
copper and sulphate of zinc in dis- 
tilled water. For the zinc solution, 
take 55-5 parts by weight of crys- 
tals of zinc sulphate (ZnSC^OH,) 
and dissolve in 44-5 parts by weight 
of distilled water; the resulting 
solution should have a specific 

fravity of 1-200 at about 20 C. 
or the sulphate of copper solution, 
take 16-5 parts by weight of pure 
crystals of copper sulphate (CuS0 4 50Hi) and dissolve in 83-5 parts 
by weight of water; the resulting solution should have a specific 
gravity of 1.100 at 20 C. The solutions should be adjusted exactly 
to these densities and kept in stock bottles, from which the reservoirs 
of the cell should be filled up as required. _ 

A form of potentiometer employing a vibration galvanometer and 
suitable for alternating current measurement by null methods has 
been devised by Dr Drysdale (see Proc. Phys. Soc. Lond. 1909, 
21, 561.)

POTENZA (anc. Potentia) f a town and episcopal see of Basil- * 
icata, Italy, capital of the province of Potenza, 103 m. by rail 
E. by S. of Naples. Pop. (1001), 12,313 (town); 16,163 (com- 
mune). Situated 2700 ft. above sea-level on an isolated hill 
above the Basento (anc. Casuentus), it is much exposed to winds 
and has a far more northerly climate than its position (40 40' 
N.) implies, and is indeed one of the coldest places in Italy 
(mean temp. Jan 37*8°, July 7°'9°> for whole year 53 F.). It 
has been almost entirely rebuilt since the earthquake of 1857. 
It has a school of the industrial arts and sciences, grows good 
wine, and makes bricks. 

The ancient Potentia lay some 470 ft. lower, by the river. 
Its name shows that it was of Roman origin, and its importance 
was no doubt due to its position at the intersection of the road 
leading west to the Via Popillia and north-east to the Via Appia, 
with the Via Herculia. No remains are visible, but a consider- 
able number of inscriptions have been found. 

Potentia must be distinguished from Potentia in Picenum, 
on the Adriatic coast, near the modern Porto di Recanati, a 
colony founded in 184 B.C., the same year as Pisaurum, but of 
which little is known. 

The abandonment of the old site and the erection of the new 
town probably date from the earthquake of 1273. By the 
Angevines Potenza was made a domain of the San Severino 
family; in the beginning of the 15th century it was held by 
Francesco Sforza, and in 1435 it passed to the Guevara family; 
the Loffredi, who succeeded by marriage, continued in possession 
till the abolition of the great fiefs. In 1694 there was a severe 
earthquake; and the more terrible earthquake which on the 16th 
and the 17th of December 1857 passed through southern Italy, 
and in Basilica ta alone killed 32,475 persons, laid the greater 
part of Potenza in ruins. In i860 it was the first town to rise 
against the Neapolitan government. 

POTGIETER, EVERHARDES JOHANNES (1808-1875), Dutch 
prose writer and poet, was born at Zwolle, in Overyssel, on the 
17th of June 1808. He started life in a merchant's office at 
Antwerp. In 1831 he made a journey to Sweden, described 
in two volumes, which appeared at Amsterdam in 1836-1840. 
Soon afterwards he settled in Amsterdam, engaged in commercial 
pursuits on his own account, but with more and more inclination 
towards literature. With Heije, the popular poet of Holland 
in those days, and Bakhuizen van den Brink, the rising historian 
(see also Groen van Prinsterer), Potgieter founded De Muzen 
(" The Muses," 1 834-1 836), a literary review, which was, how- 
ever, soon superseded by De Gids ("The Guide "), a monthly, 
which became the leading magazine of Holland. In it he wrote, 

mostly under the initials of " W. D g," a great number of 

articles and poems. The first collected edition of his poems 
(1832-1868) appeared in 2 vols. (Haarlem, 1868-1875), preceded 
by some of his contributions to De Gids, in 2 vols, also (Haar- 
lem, 1864), and followed by 3 vols, of his Studien en Schetsen 
(" Studies and Sketches," Haarlem, 1879). Soon after his 
death (Feb. 3, 1875) a more comprehensive edition of 
Potgieter's Verspreide en Nagelaten Werken (" Miscellaneous 
and Posthumous Works ") was published in 8 vols, by his 
friend and literary executor, Johan C. Zimmerman (Haarlem, 
1 875-1 87 7), who likewise supervised a more complete edition 
of Potgietcr's writings which appeared at Haarlem in 1885- 
1890 in 19 vols. Of Potgieter's Het Noorden in Omtrekken 
en Tafreelen ("The North in Outlines and Pictures") the 
third edition was issued in 1882, and an idition de luxe of 
his poems followed at Haarlem in 1893. Under the title ol 
Personen en Onderwerpen (" Persons and Subjects ") many 
of Potgieter's criticisms had collectively appeared in 3 vols, at 
Haarlem in 1885, with an introduction by Busken-Huet. 

Potgieter's favourite master among the Dutch classics was Hooft, 
whose peculiarities in style and language he admired and imitated. 
The same vein of altruistic, if often exaggerated and biased, abhor- 
rence of the wonted conventionalities of literary life runs through all 
his writings, even through his private correspondence with Huet, 
parts of which have been published. Potgieter remained to his death 
the irreconcilable enemy of the Dutch " Jan Salie," as the Dutchman 
is nicknamed who does not believe in the regeneration of the Dutch 
people. Potgieter held up the Netherlander of the golden age of the 



208 



POTHIER— POTOCKI, S. F. 



16th and 17th centuries as models to be emulated. In these views 
he essentially differed from Huet. Yet the two friends worked 
harmoniously together; and when Potgieter reluctantly gave up 
De Gids in 1865, it was Huet whom he chose as his successor. t Both 
then proceeded to Italy, and were present at the Dante festivities 
at Florence, which in Potgieter's case resulted in a poem in twenty 
stanzas, Florence (Haarlem, 1868). In Holland Potgieter's influence 
has been very marked and beneficial ; but his own style, that of ultra- 
purist, was at times somewhat forced, stilted and not always easily 
understood. (H. Ti.) 

POTHIER, ROBERT JOSEPH (1699-1772), French jurist, 
was born at Orleans on the 9th of January 1699. He studied 
law for the purpose of qualifying for the magistracy, and was 
appointed in 1720 judge of the presidial court of Orleans, 
thus following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. 
This post he held for fifty-two years. He paid particular atten- 
tion to the correction and co-ordination of the text of the 
Pandects, his Pandectae Justinianae in novum ordinem digestae 
(Paris and Chartres, 1748-17 5 2) being a classic in the study 
of Roman law. In 1749 he was made professor of law in the 
university of Orleans. He wrote many learned monographs on 
French law, and much of his work was incorporated almost, 
textually in the French Code Civil. He died at Orleans on the 
2nd of March 1772. Of his numerous treatises the following 
may be specially mentioned: Traiii des obligations (1761); 
Du Contrat de vente (1762) ; Du Contrat de bail (1764) ; Du Contrat 
de societe (1765); Des Contrats de prtt de consomption (1766); 
Du Contrat de depdl el de mandat (1766); Du Contrat de nanlisse- 
ment (1767), &c. His works have several times been published in 
collected form (edited by Giflrein, 1 820-1 824; by Dupin, 1823- 
1825, and by Bugnet, 2nd ed. 11 vols. 1861-1862). 

See Dupin, Dissertation sur la vie el les ouvrages de Poihier (Paris, 
1825), and Fremont, Vie de R. J. Poihier (Orleans, 1850). 

POTHOOK, an S-shaped metal hook for suspending a pot 
over a fire. While one extremity is hooked to the handle of 
the pot, the other is caught upon an iron crane moving on a 
pivot over the fire. Modern cooking-ranges have obviated the 
necessity for this arrangement, but it is still to be seen in great 
numbers of country cottages and farmhouse kitchens all over 
England, and in small artisans' houses in the west midlands and 
the north. In the elementary teaching of writing the " pot- 
hook " is a script of similar shape. 

POTI, a seaport of Russian Transcaucasia, in the government 
of Kutais, at the mouth of the Rion on the coast of the Black 
Sea, 193 m. by rail W.N.W. of Tiflis and 35 m. by sea N. of 
Batum. Pop. (1882), 31 12; (1897), 7666. The white walls of 
the fortress contrast with the green trees which surround them, 
and the lighthouse, 117 ft. high, is visible 17 m. Situated 
in a marshy delta not more than 25 ft. above the level of the 
river, Poti is extremely unhealthy, fever and ague prevailing 
in summer and autumn. The Russians have improved the town 
and port, but the latter is still exposed to west and south-west 
gales. A new tnt ranee was constructed in 1905, and a new inner 
harbour was at the same time under construction. The shipping 
trade amounts to £500,000 to £600,000 a year, almost entirely 
manganese ore,- with some maize. 

Poti represents the ancient Phasis, a commercial colony of 
the Greek city of Miletus. The present fortress was built in 
1578 by Sultan Muradlll. of Turkey at the time of a war with 
Persia. In 1640 it was destroyed by the Imeretians (Georgians), 
but it was restored and enlarged. The town was a great slave 
market. It was captured by the Russians in 181 2 and 1829. 

POTLATCH, a term, corrupted from a Nootka Indian word 
for " gift," for a ceremonial custom among some of the Indian 
tribes of north-west America, consisting in the distribution by 
an individual of his property among his friends and neighbours, 
who make equivalent gifts, with interest, in return. 

POTOCKI, IGNATY (1 741-1809), Polish statesman and writer, 
son of Eustachy Potocki, general of artillery of the army of 
Lithuania, was born at Podhajce. He was educated first at 
Warsaw beneath the eye of the pedagogic reformer Stanislaw 
Konarski (1 700-1 773), and subsequently in Italy, where he 
proposed to take orders. On returning home, however, he 



abandoned this idea, and as a member of the newly instituted 
commission of education rendered invaluable services to his 
country for the next sixteen years. He earnestly desired a 
reform of the constitution also, and was thus attracted to the 
party of the Czartoryscy. Elected deputy to every diet since 
1778, he was a conspicuous member of the patriotic opposition. 
In matters of importance nothing was done without his advice, 
and he was esteemed as much for his character as for his talents. 
His influence was at its height during the Four Years' Diet, 
1788-1792. He was appointed a member of the committee 
for the reform of the constitution, defended eloquently the right 
of the towns to the franchise, and was an advocate of an alliance 
with Prussia. Thus he was one of the creators of the constitu- 
tion of the 3rd of May 1791, although his aristocratic antecedents 
prevented him from going the lengths of the more radical 
reformers. On the formation of the confederation of Targowica, 
Potodri emigrated to Dresden; but on the outbreak of the 
revolution of 1794 returned to Poland, was appointed a member 
of the national government, and entrusted with the conduct of 
foreign affairs. On the fall of Warsaw he surrendered to Suvarov 
and was sent to Russia, where he remained till 1796. On his 
return to Poland he retired to the village of Klimuntowo, 
where for the next thirteen years he devoted himself to literature. 
At the end of the war of 1809 he was commissioned to go to 
Vienna to present to Napoleon the petitions of the Galicians 
for the incorporation of their province with the grand duchy 
of Warsaw. He died at Vienna the same year. The most 
notable of Potocki's works is: Vom Enistehen und Untergange 
der polnischen Konstitutionen vom jten May iygi (Lemberg, 

1793). 

See August Sokolowski, Illustrated History of Poland (Pol.), vol. 
iv. (Vienna, 1901). (R. N. B.) 

POTOCKI, STANISLAW FELIX (1752-1805), Polish politician, 
son of Franciszek Salezy Potocki, palatine of Kiev, of the 
Tulczyn line of the family, was born in 1752. He entered the 
public service, and owing to the influence of his relations became 
grand standard-bearer of the Crown at the age of twenty-two. 
In 1782 he was made palatine of Russia, in 1784 a lieutenant- 
general, and in 1 789 he purchased the rank of a general of artillery 
from the Saxon minister, Briihl, for 20,000 ducats. Elected deputy 
for Braclaw at the famous Four Years' Diet, he began that career 
of treachery which was to terminate in the ruin of his country. 
Yet his previous career had awakened many hopes in him. A 
grand seigneur ruling patriarchally in his vast estates, liberal, 
enlightened, a generous master and a professed patriot, his 
popularity culminated in 1784 when he presented an infantry 
regiment of 400 men as a free gift to the republic. But he 
identified the public welfare with the welfare of the individual 
magnates. His scheme was the division of Poland into an 
oligarchy of autonomous grandees exercising the supreme power 
in rotation (in fact a perpetual interregnum), and in 1788 he 
won over to Jiis views two other great lords, Xavier Branicki 
and Severin Rzewuski. The election of Malachowski (q.v.) 
and Kazimierz Sapieha as marshals of the diet still further 
alienated him from the Liberals; and, after strenuously but 
vainly opposing every project of reform, he retired to Vienna 
whence he continued to carry on an active propaganda against 
the new ideas. He protested against the constitution of the 
3rd of May 1 791, and after attempting fruitlessly to induce the 
emperor Leopold to take up arms " for the defence of the liberties 
of the republic," proceeded with his friends in March 1792 to 
St Petersburg, and subsequently with the connivance of the 
empress Catherine formed the confederation of Targowica for 
the maintenance of the ancient institutions of Poland (May 14, 
1792), of which he was the marshal, or rather the dictator, 
directing its operations from his castle at Tulczyn. When the 
May constitution was overthrown and the Prussians were 
already in occupation of Great Poland, Potocki (March 1793) 
went on a diplomatic mission to St Petersburg; but, finding 
himself duped and set aside, retired to Vienna till 1797, when 
he settled down at Tulczyn and devoted himself for the remainder 
of his life to the improvement of his estates. He wrote On the

Polish Succession (Pol.) (Amsterdam, 1789); Protest against 
the Succession to the Throne (Pol.) (ibid. 1790); and other political 
works.

POTOMAC, a river in the east central part of the United 
States, having its source in the Alleghany Mountains and flowing 
S.E. into Chesapeake Bay. It is formed by the union of its 
north and south branches, about 15 m. S.E. of Cumberland, 
Maryland. The main stream has a length of about 450 m. and 
is navigable for large vessels for 113 m. above its mouth. The 
north branch, about no m. long, rises in the north-eastern part 
of West Virginia, pursues a north-easterly course, and forms 
part of the boundary between Maryland and West Virginia. 
The south branch has its sources in Highland county, Va., 
and in Pendleton county, W.Va., and flows north-east for 
about 140 m. until it joins the north branch. From the junc- 
tion of these two streams until it reaches Harper's Ferry the 
Potomac river separates Maryland from West Virginia. At 
Harper's Ferry it receives the waters of the Shenandoah river 
and cuts through the Blue Ridge Mountains in a gorge noted 
for its scenic beauty. From this point to its mouth it forms the 
boundary between Virginia and Maryland. The stream crosses 
the Blue Ridge Mountains at an elevation of about 245 ft., and 
at Georgetown (Washington), 62 m. distant, it meets tidewater. 
Of this descent about 90 ft. occurs about 15 m. above Washing- 
ton, at the Great Falls, a series of rapids about a mile long and 
including a cataract at?out 35 ft. high. Three and a half miles 
above Washington are the Little Falls, which mark the head of 
navigation. Large vessels, however, are prevented by a bridge 
from proceeding above Georgetown. At Washington there are 
two channels, with respective depths at mean low water of 18 
and 21 ft. Large sums have been spent since 1870 on improving 
these channels. A few miles below the city the river broadens 
into a deep tidal estuary from 2\ to 7 m. wide; and channels 
24 ft. deep and 200 ft. wide through all the shoals were secured 
by the project of 1899. The Anacostia river, or " East Branch," 
which flows into the Potomac just south of Washington, is 
navigable for large vessels for about 2 m. and for small scows 
and lighters as far as Bladensburg, Md., 8J m. above 
its mouth ; its natural channel was narrow and tortuous, 
and about 18 ft. deep; in 1909 improvements (begun in 1902) 
had procured a channel 20 ft. deep at mean low water 
and 380 ft. wide. The Chesapeake & Ohio Canal, from 
Georgetown to Cumberland, Md., follows the Potomac closely 
on the Maryland side. The shipments over the Potomac above 
Washington in 1907 were valued at $7,596,494, and those 
below Washington at $21,093,800, the principal commodities 
being sand and gravel, ice, oils, naval ordnance and supplies, 
and building and paving materials. The shipments on the 
Anacostia river were * of much the same character, and in 
1907 were valued at $4,312,687. 

POTOROO, or Rat Kangaroo, any member of the diprotodont 
marsupial sub-family Potoroinae (see Marsupialia). None of 
them exceed a common rabbit in size. They inhabit Australia 
and Tasmania, are nocturnal, and feed on the leaves of grasses 
and other plants, as well as roots and bulbs, which they dig up 
with their forepaws; in this way some of them do considerable 
damage to cultivated crops. About ten species are known,* 
presenting a considerable range of diversity in minor characters. 
The members of the type genus (Potorous) run, rather than leap, 
and do not use the hind feet for kicking. In the genus Bettongia 
the. tail is prehensile, and with it they collect grass and twigs 
for making nests in their burrows. 

POTOSf , a department of Bolivia occupying the south-western 
angle of that republic, bounded N, by Oruro, Cochabamba and 
Chuquisaca, E. by the two last departments and Tarija, S. by 
Argentina and W. by Chile and Oruro. Pop. (1900), 325,615, 
the larger part Indians; area, 48,801 sq. m. The eastern part 
of the department is traversed north to south by the eastern 
branch of the Andes, locally known as the Cordillera de los 



Frailes and the Sierras de Chichas. Spurs and broken ranges 
project eastward from these, between which are the headstreams 
of the Pilcomayo and Guapay, the first flowing south-cast to the 
La Plata, and the second north-east to the Madeira and Amazon. 
The Pilcomayo itself rises in the department of Oruro, but several 
of its larger tributaries belong to Potosi — the San Juan, Cota- 
gaita and Tumusla in the south, and Cachimayo in the north. 
The western part of the department belongs to the great Bolivian 
altaplanicie, or southern extension of the Titicaca basin. It is 
a barren, saline waste, almost uninhabitable. In the north, 
bordering on the transverse ridge of which the Cerro de Tahua 
(17,454 ft.) forms a part, is the depression known as the Pampa 
de Empeza, 12,080 ft. above sea-level, which is largely a region 
of morasses and saline plains. On and near the southern frontier 
is another transverse ridge, in part formed by the Sierra de 
Lipez, and in part by apparently detached groups of high peaks; 
it is a wate/Iess desert like the Puna de Atacama. 

Potosf is essentially a mining department, though agriculture 
and grazing occupy some attention in the eastern valleys. The 
western plateau is rich in minerals, especially silver and copper. 
The Huanchaca group of mines, situated on the slopes of the eastern 
Cordillera, overlooking the Pampa de Empeza, has the largest output 
of silver in Bolivia. The Pulacayo mine, belonging to this group, 
IS^SS ft. above sea-level, ranks next to the Broken Hill mine of 
Australia in production. Between 1873 an d I001 it yielded 4520 tons 
of silver, of an estimated value of £23,200,000. Farther south are 
the Portugalete mines, once very productive, and near the Argentine 
border are the Lipez mines. East of the Cordilleras are the famous 
" silver mountain " of Potosf, once the richest silver mine in the 
world; the snow-capped peak of Chorolque (18,452 ft.), which is 
claimed to have the highest mine in the world ; Porco, a few miles 
south-west of Potosi; Guadalupe, Colguechaca and Aullagas. 
Besides silver, the Chorolque mines also yield tin, copper, bismuth, 
lead and wolfram. In 1907 the national government undertook 
railways from Potosf to Oruro, 205 m., and from Potosi to Tupiza, 
155 m., to connect with the Central Northern line of Argentina, 
which was opened to Quiaca on the frontier on the 25th of May 1908. 
In western Potosf the department is traversed by the Antofagasta 
& Oruro railway (0-75 metre gauge). Besides Potosi, the capital 
of the department, the principal towns are Huanchaca (pop. about 
10,000 in 1904), the seat of famous silver mines, 13,458 ft. elevation, 
and overlooking the Pampa de Empeza; Uyuni, 9 m. from Huan- 
chaca, 12,100^ ft. above sea-level, a small town but an important 
railway junction and commercial centre on the waterless plain, the 
shipping point and supply station for an extensive mining region; 
and Tupiza (pop. about 5000 in 1906), a prettily situated town near 
the Argentine frontier, on a small branch of the San Juan river, 
9800 ft. above sea-level. 

POTOSI, a city of Bolivia, capital of the department of Potosf, 
47 m. (direct) S.W. of Sucr6, or 88 m. by the post-road. Pop. 
(1906, estimate), 23,450. Potosf stands on a barren terrace 
on the northern slope of the Cerro Gordo de Potosi, 12,992 ft. 
above sea-level, and is one of the highest towns in the world. 
The famous cerro from which its name is taken rises above 
the town to a height of 15,381 ft., a barren, white-capped cone 
honeycombed with mining shafts. The town is regularly laid 
out with streets crossing each other at right angles. The smoke- 
begrimed buildings, many of which are unoccupied and in ruins, 
are commonly of adobe. A large plaza forms the conventional 
centre, around which are grouped various religious edifices, the 
government house, town hall, national college, the old " royal 
mint " dating from 1585, and the treasury. The city has a 
massive, plain cathedral, which in part dates from early colonial 
times, and in part from the closing years of Spanish rule. The 
water supply is derived from a costly system of reservoirs and 
aqueducts constructed by the Spanish government during the 
years of the city's greatest prosperity. There are 27 of these 
artificial lakes, and the aqueducts originally numbered 32, some 
of which are no longer serviceable. Rough mountain roads 
and pack animals are the only means of transportation to and 
from Potosf, but a railway from Oruro to Tupiza via Potosf, 
forming part of the projected Pan-American route, was con- 
tracted for in 1908. In 1611 the population of Potosf was 
reported to be 160,000, which probably included the whole 
mining district. A part of the diminution since then is explained 
by the fact that the great majority of the mines on the cerro 
have been abandoned.

POTOTAN— POTT, P. 



The foundation of the city dates from 1547, two years after 
the first discovery of silver on the cerro by an Indian herder 
named Gualci. Charles V. conferred upon it the title of " villa 
imperial." From 1545 to 1800 the crown tax of one-fifth upon 
the mineral product amounted to £32,600,000, showing an 
acknowledged output of £163,000,000. The actual output, 
however, must have been much greater, as Spain was flooded 
with contraband silver, and there was a large trade in it at 
La Plata ports, whence it was taken to Brazil and Portugal. 
The total output to 1864 has heen estimated at more than 
£400,000,000, but the annual output at the beginning of the 
20th century barely exceeded 400,000 ozs. The struggle for 
independence began in Potosf on the 9th of November 1810, 
but the Spanish forces succeeded in retaining possession down 
to 1822. 

POTOTAN, a town of Jhe province of Iloilo, island of Pan ay, 
Philippine Islands, on the Jalaur river, about 17 m. N. of 
Iloilo. Pop. (1903), 37,373, including the population of Dingle 
(12,129) an( i Mina (4280), annexed after the census was taken. 
There is a fine church in the old town and a large stone church 
in Dingle; in the old town are several other buildings of masonry 
and some beautiful " fire " trees for shade. The principal 
industries are the cultivation of sugar-cane, Indian corn, rice, 
tobacco and hemp, and the raising of cattle, carabaos, sheep and 
horses. 

POTSDAM, a town of Germany, the administrative capital of 
the Prussian province of Brandenburg, and one of the principal 
residences of the German Emperor, beautifully situated on the 
river Havel, 16 m. S.W. of Berlin, on the main line of railway 
to Magdeburg. Pop. (1905), 6r,4i4. It is also connected with 
the capital by two local lines and by a steamboat service through 
the chain of lakes formed by the river. The greater part of the 
town lies on the right hank of the Havel and is connected with 
the Teltow suburb on the opposite bank by a long bridge (Lange 
Briicke). At the north end of this bridge rises the royal palace, 
a large quadrangular building of the 17th century, with a 
colonnade, chiefly interesting for the numerous relics it contains 
of Frederick the Great, who made it his favourite residence. At 
the south-eastern corner of the palace, close to the bridge, is 
the tree under which petitioners waited for the answer to their 
grievances, which Frederick the Great gave from an opposite 
window. It also contains reminiscences of Voltaire, who resided 
here for several years. The principal churches are the Nikolai- 
kirche; the Church of the Holy Ghost, huilt in 1728; the garrison 
church, containing the remains of Frederick the Great and his 
father, Frederick William I.; and the Friedenskirche, or Church 
of Peace, erected by Frederick William IV. in 1845-1850. To the 
Friedenskirche is attached a mausoleum built after the model 
of a chapel at Innichen in Tirol, in which are huried Emperor 
Frederick III. and his consort, the Princess Royal of Great 
Britain, and two of their children who died in infancy. Among 
other conspicuous buildings are the large barracks and other 
military establishments; the town hall; and the Brandenburg 
gate, in the style of a Roman triumphal arch. The town has 
fine statues of several of the Prussian kings, including Frederick 
the Great. The Lustgarten, the Wilhelmsplatz and the Plantage 
are open spaces laid out as pleasure-grounds and adorned with 
statues and husts. In spite of its somewhat sleepy appearance, 
Potsdam has manufactures of silk goods, chemicals, furniture, 
chocolate, tohacco and optical instruments. Market-gardening 
affords occupation to many of the inhabitants, and the cultiva- 
tion of winter violets is a specialty. The Havel is well stocked 
with fish. On a wooded eminence to the south of the town lies 
the observatory with extensive premises. 

Potsdam is almost entirely surrounded by a fringe of royal palaces, 
parks and pleasure-grounds, which fairly substantiate its claim to 
the title of a " German Versailles." Immediately to the west is the 
park of Sans Souci, laid out by Frederick the Great, and largely 
extended by Frederick William IV. It is in the formal French 
styje of the period, and is adorned with fountains, statuary and 
artificial ruins. Near the palace is the famous .windmill ; now royal 
property, which, according to a tradition now regarded as doubtful, 
its owner refused to sell to the king, meeting threatened violence 



by an appeal to the judges of Berlin. A little farther on is the 
Orangery, an extensive edifice in the Italian style, containing numer- 
ous pictures and other works of art. The park also includes the 
Charlottenhof, a reproduction of a Pompeian villa. At the west 
end of the park stands the New Palace, a huge brick edifice 375 ft. 
in length, erected by Frederick the Great at enormous expense in 
1 763-1 769. It was occupied for a while by the emperor Frederick 111., 
and was rechristened by him " Fried richskron. On the accession 
of the emperor William II. its original name was restored. It is 
now the residence of the emperor. It contains reminiscences of 
Frederick and of Voltaire, a few pictures by ancient masters, a 
theatre, and a large hall decorated with shells and minerals. The 
spacious buildings at the back are devoted to the "Lehrbataillon, " 
a battalion of infantry composed of drafts from different regiments 
trained here to ensure uniformity of drill throughout the army. 
To the north of Potsdam lies a small Russian village, Alexandrowka, 
built in 1826 to accommodate the Russian singers attached to the 
Prussian guards. A little to the east of it, on the Heiligersee, is the 
New Garden, containing the Marble Palace. The list of Potsdam 
palaces may be closed with two situated on the left bank of the 
Havel — one at Klein-Glienicke, formerly the country-seat of Prince 
Frederick Charles of Prussia (the " Red Prince "), and the other on 
the hill of Babelsberg. The latter, designed as a miniature copy of 
Windsor Castle, in the midst of a park in the English taste, was 
formerly the summer residence of the emperor William I. 

Potsdam was originally a Slavonic fishing- village named Poztupimi, 
and is first mentioned in a document of 993. It became a town in 
the 14th century, but was unimportant until the great elector 
built a palace here between 1660 and 1682; and even at the close of 
his reign it only contained 3000 inhabitants. The elector Frederick 
William I. greatly enlarged Potsdam, and his stiff military tastes 
are reflected in the monotonous uniformity of the streets. Frederick 
the Great continued his father's work, and is the real creator of 
the modern splendour of the town, to which all his successors have 
contributed.

POTSDAM, a village of St Lawrence county, New York, U.S.A., 
in the township of Potsdam, on the Raquette river, about 68 m. 
N.E.of Watertown. Pop. of the village (1905) 4162; (1910) 4036; 
of the township (1905) 8992; (191 o) 8725. The village is served 
by the New York Central & Hudson River railway. It has a 
public library and is the seat of a state Normal School (1869), 
an outgrowth of St Lawrence Academy (founded in 18 10 by 
Benjamin Raymond and maintained by him until 1816, when it 
was incorporated) ; of the Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial School of 
Technology (1896), founded by his sisters in honour of Thomas 
Streatfield Glarksoh (1837-1894); and of the Crane Normal 
Institute of Music. The village has a considerable trade in 
dairy products. In the neighbourhood are extensive quarries 
of the well-known " Potsdam sandstone," the uppermost division 
of the Cambrian system, described as a " fine-grained sandstone 
cemented with silica," and very durable. The House of Parlia- 
ment at Quebec, All Saints Cathedral at Albany, New York, 
and many other public edifices were built of this stone. 

The " Ten Towns " of St Lawrence county, including the 
township of Potsdam, were sold by the state in 1787. The first 
settlement was made on the Raquette river, close to the present 
village, in 1803; the township was incorporated in 1806 and 
the village in 1831. Potsdam was named after Potsdam in 
Prussia hecause of the occurrence in each locality of reddish 
sandstone. 

POTT, AUGUST FRIEDRICH (1802-1887), German philologist, 
was horn at Nettelrede, Hanover, on the 14th of November 1802. 
He studied in Gottingen, and in 1825 became schoolmaster at 
Celle, Hanover; but after two years removed to Berlin, where he 
became privatdozent at the university. He studied comparative 
philology, and in 1883 was made professor at Halle, where he 
lived till his death on the 5th of July 1887. His Etymologische 
Forschungen (1 834-1836) entitled him to rank as Bopp's foremost 
disciple in the Indo-Germanic science of language. Pott also 
devoted much attention to the origins of the gipsies. 

POTT, PERCIVALL (1714-1788), English surgeon, was horn 
in London on the 6th of January 17 14. He served his appren- 
ticeship with Edward Nourse, assistant surgeon to St Bartholo- 
mew's Hospital, and in 1736 was admitted to the Barbers'

Company and licensed to practise. He became assistant 
surgeon to St Bartholomew's in 1744 and full surgeon from 1749 
till 1787. He died in London on the 22nd of December 1788. 
The first surgeon of his day in England, excelling even his pupil, 
John Hunter, on the practical side, he introduced various 
important innovations in procedure, doing much to abolish the 
extensive use of escharotics and the actual cautery that was 
prevalent when he began, his career. A particular form of 
fracture of the ankle which he sustained through a fall from his 
horse in 1756 is still described as Pott's fracture, and his book, 
Some few Remarks upon Fractures and Dislocations, published in 
1768 and translated into French and Italian, had a far-reaching 
influence in Great Britain and France. " Pott's disease " is a 
spinal affection of which he gave an excellent clinical description 
in his Remarks on that kind of Palsy of the Lower Limbs which is 
frequently found lo accompany a Curvature of the Spine (1779). 
Among his other writings the most noteworthy are A Treatise on 
Ruptures (1756), Observations on the Nature and Consequences of 
those Injuries lo which the Head is liable from external violence 
(1768), and Chifurgical Observations (1775). There are several 
editions of his collected works; that published by Sir James 
Earle in 1790 contains a sketch of his life. 

POTTER, ALONZO (1800-1865), American bishop of the 
Protestant Episcopal Church, was born at Beekman (now La 
Grange), Dutchess county, New York, on the 6th of July 1800. 
His ancestors, English Friends, settled in Portsmouth, Rhode 
Island, between 1640 and 1660; his father was a farmer, a 
Quaker, and in 1798 and in 1814 was a member of the New York 
Assembly. The son graduated at Union College in 1818, and 
in 1821-1826 was professor of mathematics and natural philo- 
sophy there. In 1824 he was ordained priest, and married a 
daughter of President Eliphalet Nott of Union College; she died 
in 1839, and in 1841 he married her cousin. He was rector of 
St Paul's Boston, from 1826 to 183 1, when he became professor 
of moral and intellectual philosophy and political economy at 
Union. In 1838 he refused the post of assistant bishop of the 
eastern diocese (Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and 
Rhode Island). He was vice-president of Union College in 
1838-1845. After the suspension of Henry Ustick Onderdonk 
(1 789-1858) from the bishopric of Pennsylvania Potter was 
chosen to succeed him, and was consecrated on the 23rd of 
September 1845. • Owing to his failing health he visited England 
and France in 1858, and in April 1864 sailed from New York 
for California, but died on board ship in San Francisco harbour 
on the 4th of July 1865. 

In 1846 he established the western and north-eastern convocations 
of priests in his diocese; from 1850 to 1860, when its corner-stone was 
laid, he laboured for the " Hospital of the Protestant Episcopal 
Church in Philadelphia"; and in 1861 he established the Phila- 
delphia Divinity School. In 1842 with George B. Emerson (1797- 
1871) he published The School and the Schoolmaster, which had a 
large circulation and great influence. In 1847, 1848, 1849 and 1853 
he delivered five courses of lectures on the Lowell Institute founda- 
tion. He advocated temperance reform and frequently delivered 
a lecture on the Drinking Usages of Society (1852) ; he was an oppon- 
ent of slavery and published a reply to the pro-slavery arguments 
of Bishop John Henry Hopkins (1792-1868) of Vermont. He 
edited many reprints and collections of sermons and lectures, and 
wrote: Political Economy (1840), The Principles* of Science applied 
to the Domestic and Mechanic Arts (1841), Handbook for Readers and 
Students (1843), and Religious Philosophy, (1870). 

See M. A. de Wolfe Howe, Memoirs of the Life and Services of the 
Right Reverend Alonzo Potter, D.D. (Philadelphia, 1871). 

His brother, Horatio Potter (i8o2-i887),was born in Beck- 
man, New York, on the 9th of February 1802. He graduated 
at Union College in 1826, was ordained a priest of the Protestant 
Episcopal Church in 1828, was rector for several months in Saco, 
Maine, and in 1828-1833 was professor of mathematics and 
natural philosophy at Washington (now Trinity) College, Hart- 
ford, Connecticut. In 1833-1854 he was rector of St Peter's, 
Albany; in November 1854 he was elected provincial bishop of 
New York in place of Benjamin Tredwell Onderdonk (1791- 
1861), who had been suspended, and upon Onderdonk's death 
he became bishop. In 1868 his diocese was divided, the new 
dioceses of Albany, Central New York and Long Island being 



separated from it. Bishop Potter attended the Lambeth 
conferences of 1867 and 1868. His failing health put an end 
to his active service in 1883, when his nephew, H. C. Potter (q.v.) y 
became his assistant. He died in New York City on the 2nd 
of January 1887. 

POTTER, HENRY CODMAN (1835-1908), American Protes- 
tant Episcopal bishop, the son of Bishop Alonzo Potter, was 
born in Schenectady, New York, on the 25th of May 1835. He 
was educated in the Philadelphia Academy of the Protestant 
Episcopal Church and in the Theological Seminary of Virginia, 
where he graduated in 1857. He was ordained deacon in 1857 
and priest in 1858; was rector of Christ Church, Greensburg, 
Pennsylvania, in 1 858-1859, and of St John's Church, Troy, 
N. Y., in 1850-1866; refused the presidency of Kenyon College 
in 1863 and the bishopric of Iowa in 1875; was secretary of 
the House of Bishops in 1866-1883; and was assistant rector 
of Trinity Church, Boston, in 1866-1868, and rector of Grace 
Church, New York City, in 1868-1884. In October 1883 he was 
consecrated assistant to his uncle, Horatio Potter, bishop of 
New York, and in 1 887 succeeded him. The Rev. David Hummell 
Greer (b. 1844) became his coadjutor in September 1903, and 
succeeded to the bishopric after the death of Bishop Potter in 
Coopers town, N. Y., on the 21st of July 1908. During Bishop 
Potter's administration the corner-stone of the Cathedral of 
St John the Divine was laid (in 1892). 

He was notable for his interest in social reform and in politics: 
as rector of Grace Church he worked to make it an " institutional 
church " with working-men's clubs, day nurseries, kindergartens, 
&c., and he took part in the summer work of the missions on the 
east side in New York City long after he was bishop; in 1900 he 
attacked the Tammany mayor (Robert A. Van Wyck) of New York 
City, accusing the city government of protecting vice, and was a 
leader in the reform movement which elected Seth Low mayor 
in the same year; he frequently assisted in settling labour disputes; 
he worked for the re-establish men t of the army canteen and 
attempted to improve the saloon, which he called the " poor man's 
club " — notably by his taking part in the opening (August, 1904) 
of the unsuccessful Subway Tavern. He published: Sisterhoods 
and Deaconesses at Home and Abroad (1872); The Gates of the East 
(1876), a book of travels; Sermons of the City (1881); Waymarks 
(1892); The Scholar and the Stale (1897); The East of To-day and To- 
morrow (1902); The Industrial Situation (1902); Law and Loyalty 
(1903), and Reminiscences of Bishops and *Arch-Bishops (1906). 

See Harriett A. Kayser, Bishop Potter, the Peoples Friend (New 
York, 1910). 

His brother, Clarkson Nott Potter (1825-1882), was a civil 
engineer, then (1848-1868) a practising lawyer in New York City, 
and in 1 869-1 875 and in 1 877-1 881 a Democratic member of the 
National House of Representatives. Another brother, Robert 
Brown Potter (1 820-1 887), a lawyer and a soldier, commanded 
the 51st New York Volunteers at Cedar Mountain, Second Bull 
Run and Antietam, was wounded at Antietam and at Petersburg, 
was commissioned major-genera! of volunteers in September 1865, 
and was mustered out in 1866. A third brother, Eliphalet Nott 
Potter (i 836-1901), was rector of the Church of the Nativity, 
South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1862-1869, was professor of 
ethics in Lehigh University in 1 869-1 871, and was president of 
Union College in 1 871-1884, of Hobart College in 1884-1897, and of 
Cosmopolitan University, a correspondence school, in 1897-1901. 

POTTER, JOHN (c. 1674-1747), archbishop of Canterbury, 
was the son of a linen-draper at Wakefield, Yorkshire, and was 
born about 1674. At the age of fourteen he entered University 
College, Oxford, and in 1693 he published notes on Plutarch's 
De audiendis poetis and Basil's Oratio ad juvenes. In 1694 he 
was elected fellow of Lincoln College, and in 1697 his edition of 
Lycophron appeared. It was followed by his Archaeologia 
graeca (2 vols. 8vo, 1 697-1 798), the popularity of which endured 
till the advent of.Dr William Smith's dictionaries. A reprint 
of his Lycophron in 1702 was dedicated to Graevius, and the 
Antiquities was afterwards published in Latin in the Thesaurus 
of Gronovius. Besides holding several livings he became in 
1704 chaplain to Archbishop Tenison, and shortly afterwards 
was made chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Anne. From 1708 he 
was regius professor of divinity and canon of Christ Church, 
Oxford; and from 1715 he was bishop of Oxford. In the latter 
year appeared his edition of Clement of Alexandria. In 1707 
he published a Discourse on Church Government, and he took a 
prominent part in the controversy with Benjamin Hoadly,

POTTER, P.— POTTO 



bishop of Bangor. In January 1737 Potter was unexpectedly 
appointed to succeed Wake in the see of Canterbury. He died 
on the 10th of October 1747. His Theological Works, consisting 
of sermons, charges, divinity lectures and the Discourse on Church 
Government , were published in 3 vols. 8vo, in 1753. 

POTTER, PAUL (1625-1654), Dutch animal painter, was born 
at Enkhuizen, Holland. He was instructed in art by his father, 
Peter Potter, a landscape and figure painter of some merit, and 
by Nicolas Moeyaert, of Amsterdam. Other masters and 
influences are mentioned by various writers, but more than any 
other of his contemporaries he learnt through direct study from 
nature. By the time he had attained his fifteenth year his 
productions were already much esteemed. In 1646 he went to 
Delft, where he became a member of the gild of St Luke. At the 
age of twenty he settled at the Hague, and there married in 
1650. He was patronized by Maurice, prince of Orange, for 
whom he painted the life-size picture of the " Young Bull," now 
one of the most celebrated works in the gallery of the Hague. 
In 1652 he was induced by Burgomaster Tulp of Amsterdam to 
remove to that city. His constitution seems to have been 
feeble, and his health suffered from the unremitting diligence 
with which he pursued his art. He died on the 15th of January 
1654 at the age of twenty-nine. 

His paintings are generally small; early in life, however, he 
attempted, but with ill success, to work on a monumental scale, 
as in the " Bear Hunt " at the Rijks Museum and the " Boar 
Hunt " of the Carstanjen collection, Berlin. Even the famous 
" Equestrian Portrait of Tulp " in the Six collection, Amsterdam, 
is awkward and stiff and hard in handling. His animals are 
designed with careful accuracy, while the landscape backgrounds 
are introduced with spirit and appropriateness. His colour is 
clear and transparent, his execution firm and finished without 
being laboured. His view of nature is purely objective and 
unemotional; he painted with the greatest directness and simpli- 
city the things he saw before him, and his paintings of horses and 
cattle are so individualized that they become faithful portraits 
of the animals. The best among his small portraits of horses 
are in the Louvre and in the Schwerin Gallery; and certain of 
his studies are the most brilliant of all. 

The earliest dated picture of importance is " Abraham Entering 
Into Canaan " (1642), at the Germanic Museum in Nuremberg, in 
which he makes the Scriptural subject an excuse for^ painting the 
patriarch's herds, just as in his " Orpheus " of 1650 (Rijks Museum, 
Amsterdam) he makes similar use of the Greek myth. Among his 
finest works on a small scale are acattle piece (1653) in the Due 
d'Arenberg's collection, and a similar, though earlier, picture in 
the Munich Pinakothek. In spite of his early death Paul Potter 
produced a great number of works. He worked with feverish appli- 
cation, as though he were aware of the short span of life that was 
granted him. He executed a series of some twenty etchings, mainly 
of animals, which are simple and direct in method and handling. 
Here, as in painting, his precocity was remarkable: his large plate 
of the " Herdsman," produced when he was only eighteen, and that 
of the " Shepherd," which dates from the following year, show him 
at his best as an accomplished master of the point. 

Potter's works have been engraved by Bartolozzi, Danckerts, 
Visscher, Le Bas and others. Authentic paintings from his brush 
command^ very considerable prices. At the Stover sale in 1890 
" The Dairy Farm " realized the record price of £6090. There are 
two of his paintings at the National Gallery, three in Buckingham 
Palace and a few in the duke of Westminster's collection. On the 
continent of Europe the most numerous and representative examples 
are to be found at the Rijks Museum in Amsterdam, the Hermitage 
in St Petersburg, and the Dresden Gallery.

POTTER, PHILIP CIPRIANI HAMBLEY (1792-1871), English 
musician, was born in London, the son of a pianoforte teacher, 
and godson of a sister of G. B. Cipriani, the painter. He was 
educated for the musical profession under Attwood, Callcott, 
Crotch and Woelfl; later at Vienna, where he received encourage- 
ment from Beethoven. In 181 6 an overture by him was per- 
formed at a Philharmonic concert, and he began a distinguished 
career as a pianist. In 1822 he became a professor, and in 1832 
principal (resigning in 1859) of the Royal Academy of Music; in 



i860 an exhibition was founded there in his honour. Cipriani 
Potter composed many works, now mostly forgotten, though 
important in their day. He died on the 28th of September 
1871. 

POTTERIES, THE, a name popularly applied to a district of 
north Staffordshire, the principal seat of the china and earthen- 
ware industry in England. It lies in the valley of the Trent a 
little south of its source, and extends into tributary valleys 
and up the hills flanking them. For a distance of 9 m. from 
south-east to north-west, and about 3 m. from north-east to 
south-west, the district resembles one great town, but the chief 
centres are Burslem, Hanley, Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, 
Fenton and Tunstall. Under the " Potteries federation " 
scheme (1908) these towns were amalgamated in 1910 as one 
municipal borough under the name of Stoke-on-Trent. New- 
castle-under-Lyme, though not sharing in the staple industry, 
may also be reckoned in the district. Among the lesser manufac- 
turing centres Etruria, ranking as a suburb of Hanley, is well 
known for its connexion with Josiah Wedgwood, who founded 
works here in 1769. The Wedgwoods and the Mintons are the 
two most famous family names connected with the china industry 
of- the district. Coal and coarse clay are the only local natural 
products necessary to the industry; the finer clay and other 
ingredients are brought from Cornwall and elsewhere. Ironstone 
is raised in the district. The North Staffordshire and London & 
North- Western railways and the Grand Trunk canal are the 
principal means of communication. 

POTTHAST, AUGUST (1824-1898), German historian, was 
born at Hoxter on the 13th of August 1824, and was educated at 
Paderborn, Munster and Berlin. He assisted G. H. Pertz, the 
editor of the Monumenla Germaniae historica, and edited the 
Regesta pontificum romanorum, xig8-xj04 (Berlin, 1874-1875). 
From 1874 to 1894 he was librarian of the German Reichstag. 
Potthast is chiefly known through his monumental Bibliotheca 
historica medii aevi (1862), a guide to the sources of European 
history in the middle ages. The work, in the form of an index, 
gives particulars of practically all the historical writers of Europe 
and their work between 375 and 1500. A new and enlarged 
edition appeared at Berlin in 1896. Potthast died on the 13th 
of February 1898. 

POTTINGER, ELDRED (1811-1843), Anglo-Indian soldier and 
diplomatist, entered the Bombay Artillery in 1827, and after 
some years of regimental duty was appointed to the political 
department under Colonel (afterwards Sir Henry) Pottinger. 
In 1837 he made a journey through Afghanistan in disguise. 
Arriving at Herat, he found it threatened by a Persian army 
(with which were some Russian officers) and immediately made 
himself known to the Afghan commander, offering his services. 
The attack which soon followed was conducted with the greatest 
vigour, but the defence, inspired by Pottinger, was invariably 
successful, and after a year the siege was raised. For this great 
service Pottinger was thanked by the governor-general, the earl 
of Auckland, made brevet-major, and also received the C.B. 
He was also appointed political officer at Herat. In 1841 he 
was political officer in Kohistan when the revolt against Shah 
Shuja broke out there. Taking refuge with the Gurkha garrison 
of Charikar, Ma'jor Pottinger stood a siege of fourteen days, 
and then made an adventurous retreat to Kabul. Less than a 
fortnight after his arrival Sir William Macnaghten was murdered, 
and Pottinger succeeded to his position as envoy to the Afghan 
court. The apathy of the military leaders made resistance 
hopeless, and it only remained to negotiate for the withdrawal 
of the British mission. Pottinger himself was one of the hostages 
handed over to Akbar Khan, and thus escaped the massacre 
in the Khyber Pass. Released, after many months' captivity, 
by Sir George Pollock's army, he returned to India, and a year 
later died while visiting Hong-Kong. 

POTTO, the native name of the West African slow-lemurs, 
popularly miscalled " sloths," and scientifically known as 
Perodicticus, a name referring to the aborted condition of the 
index finger, which forms their most distinctive feature. The 
ordinary potto (P. potto) is about the size of a squirrel, but with 



POTTSTOWN— POULTRY AND POULTRY-FARMING 213 



large staring eyes, and a mere stump of a tail; its general colour 
is rufous brown. Bates's potto (P. batesi), of the Congo, is 
nearly allied; but the awantibo (P. [Arctoccbus] calabar ensis) , 
of Old Calabar, differs by the complete loss of the tail (see 
Primates). 

POTTSTOWN, a borough of Montgomery county, Penn- 
sylvania, U.S.A., on the Schuylkill river, 40 m. N.W. of Phila- 
delphia. Pop. (iqio census) 15,599- Pottstown is served 
by the Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia & Reading railways, 
and by electric lines to neighbouring towns. In the borough is 
the Hill School (1851), an excellent secondary school for boys. 
There is trade with the surrounding country, which is devoted 
to farming and dairying and abounds in iron ore andHimestone, 
but the principal industry is the manufacture of iron and steel, 
the first commercially important iron furnaces in Pennsylvania 
having been established near the site of Pottstown in 1716-1718. 
In 1905 the factory products were valued at $8,144,723 (10-7% 
more than in 1900). Three miles from Pottstown, in an amuse- 
ment park, are the " ringing rocks," which cover about an acre, 
and have varying tones when struck, so that tunes may be 
played upon them. Pottstown was settled and laid out in 
1752 and was named Pottsgrove in honour of its founder, 
John Potts (1710-1768); in 1815 it was incorporated as a 
borough and in 1829 the present name was adopted. 

POTTSVILLE, a borough and the county-seat of Schuylkill 
county, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., at Schuylkill Gap through Sharp 
Mountain on the Schuylkill river, about 90 m. N.W. of Phila- 
delphia. Pop. (iqio census) 20,236. It is served by the 
Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Valley and the Philadelphia & Reading 
railways, and by the Eastern Pennsylvania railway company to 
the borough of Minersville (pop., 1910, 7240), about 4§m. N.N.E., 
and to the other boroughs in the immediate neighbourhood, 
for which Pottsville is a business and shipping centre. It is 
picturesquely situated in the famous Schuylkill coalfield and 
on the old Schuylkill canal and Tumbling Run, and has a con- 
siderable number of summer visitors. There are large repair 
shops of the Pennsylvania and of the Philadelphia & Reading 
railways at Pottsville. In 1905 the total value of the factory 
products was $5,805,788. 

The first settlers here, a single family, were massacred by the 
Indians in August 1780; a second settlement was established 
about 1795, and an iron furnace was erected a few years later. 
In 1804 this furnace was purchased by John Pott (1750-1827), 
the founder of the borough; in 1807 coal was discovered; in 
1816 the town was laid out; in 1828 it was incorporated as a 
borough; and in 1851 the borough became the county-seat. In 
1 854-1 87 7 Pottsville was a centre of the Molly Maguire 
disturbances, and here a number of the leaders were tried 
and convicted ^11876-1877. In 1908 the borough of Yorkville 
(pop., 1900, 1 1 25) was annexed to Pottsville. 

POTWALLOPER, or Potwaller, the name of a class of 
persons who were entitled in certain English boroughs to the 
parliamentary franchise. The word is usually taken to mean 
literally " one who boils a pot," from " wallop " or " gallop," 
which Skeat (Etym. Did., 1898) connects with the Old Low 
Ger. wallen, to boil, cf. " well," i.e. which springs or boils up. 
The " Potwalloper " was denned in Curry's Case, 1838 (Fate 
and Fitz., p. 311) as " one, whether he be a householder or a 
lodger, who has the sole dominion over a room with a fireplace 
in it, and who furnishes and cooks his own diet at his own 
fireplace." The Representation of the People Act (1832) 
reserved these ancient franchise rights to their then holders only. 
In the Return of Parliamentary Constituencies (Electors, &c), 
1898, there was one "potwalloper " oji the register. 

POUCHED MOUSE, the colonial name for any member of 
the polyprotodont marsupial genus Phascologale (see Marsupi- 
alia). There are over a dozen species, none larger, the most 
much smaller than a rat. The food of these animals is almost 
entirely insects, which some pursue among the branches of trees, 
while others are purely terrestrial. Pouched mice are found 
throughout Australia, where all the species have uniformly 
coloured fur, and also in New Guinea and the Aru and some 



of the adjacent islands, most of the Papuan forms being 
distinguished by striping on the back. In the view of Oldfield 
Thomas these marsupials fill the place held in Malaya by the 
tree-shrews, and in South America by the smaller opossums. 

POUGHKEEPSIE, a city and the county-seat of Dutchess 
county, New York, U.S.A., and on the east bank of the Hudson 
river, 73 m. N. of New York City. Pop. (1910 census), 
27,936. It is served by the New York Central & Hudson River, 
the New York, New Haven & Hartford, the West Shore, the 
Central New England, and the Poughkecpsie & Eastern (merged 
in the Central New England) railways, and by river steamboat 
lines on the Hudson. A cantilever railway bridge, 2260 ft. long 
(6767 ft., including approaches) and 200 ft. above the water, 
spans the Hudson at this point. The city is built partly on 
terraces rising 200 ft. above the river and partly on a level 
plateau above. On the Hudson here is the course for the inter- 
collegiate boat-races in which the American college crews (save 
those of Yale and Harvard, which row on the Thames at New 
London) have rowed annually, beginning in 1895, except in 1896, 
when the race was rowed at Saratoga. In the north-eastern part 
of the city is College Hill Park, and in the centre is Eastman 
Park (11 acres, originally the home of Harvey Gridley Eastman). 
Vassar College (q.v.), one of the most famous women 's colleges 
in America, occupies extensive grounds a short distance east 
of the city. Other educational institutions are the Lyndon 
Hall School (1848) for girls, Putnam Hall (for girls), St Faith's 
School (Protestant Episcopal; removed in 1904 from Saratoga 
Springs, where it was founded in 1890), Riverview Military 
Academy (1836), and Eastman Business College, one of the 
largest commercial schools in the country, founded in 1859 by 
Harvey Gridley Eastman (1832-1878). Immediately north of 
Poughkeepsie is the Hudson River State Hospital for the 
Insane (1871); in the city are the Vassar Brothers' Hospital 
(1878), with which a nurses' training school is connected; the 
Vassar Brothers' Home (1881) for aged and infirm men; the 
Poughkeepsie Orphan House and Home for the Friendless (1847) ; 
the Old Ladies' Home (1870); the Pringle Memorial Home 
(1899), for aged and indigent men, and the Adriance Memorial 
Library (45,000 volumes in 1909). The city is a manufacturing 
centre of considerable importance; the factory products in 1905 
were valued at $7,206,914, an increase of 29-2% over 1900. 

Poughkeepsie was settled by the Dutch about 1698, taking its 
name from an Indian word " Apokeepsing," or " Pooghkepe- 
singh," which seems to have been the name of a waterfall on the 
river front. The New York legislature met in Poughkecpsie 
in 1778, 1780, 1781, 1782, 1788 and 1795, and here in 1788 
met the convention which ratified for New York the Federal 
constitution (July 28). Poughkeepsie was incorporated as a 
village in 1799 and was chartered as a city in 1854. 

POULTICE, a mass of linseed-meal, bread or other substance, 
sometimes of medicinal herbs, mixed with boiling water and 
enclosed in muslin or linen and applied to the skin to reduce 
inflammation, to induce warmth, or when mixed with mustard, 
&c, as a counter-irritant. The word seems to have been taken 
from the plural pultes of the Lat. puis, pottage, pulse, Gr. tt6Xtos. 

POULTRY AND POULTRY-FARMING. The term 
11 poultry " (from " poult," Fr. poulel, dim. of poulc> a fowl) is 
usually regarded as including the whole of the domesticated 
birds reclaimed by man for the sake of their flesh and their eggs. 
The most important is the common fowl, which is remarkable 
as having no distinctive English name; but the present article 
also deals with the poultry-farming side of the turkey, the 
guinea-fowl, the duck and the goose. For purely zoological 
details the separate articles referred to should be consulted. 

Fowls. — The common fowl (see Fowl) belongs to the restricted 
genus Gallus, of which four wild species are known — the Bankiva 
jungle fowl (G. ferrugineus), the Sonnerat jungle fowl (G. 
sonneratt), the Ceylon jungle fowl (G. stanleyi), and the forked- 
tail jungle fowl (G. furcatus). The origin of the domesticated 
breeds is ascribed by Darwin, Blyth and other naturalists to 
the Bankiva fowl, much stress being laid on the comparative 
want of fertility in the hybrids produced between this species 



214 



POULTRY AND POULTRY-FARMING 



or the domesticated breeds and the other three forms of wild 
Galli, but it is probable that this want of fertility was due in 
great part to the unnatural conditions under which the parent 
and offspring were placed, as, if bred under more natural condi- 
tions, there is no difficulty in rearing these hybrids or in breeding 
from them with the domesticated varieties. 

Breeds. — The number of poultry exhibitions has nowadays 
multiplied to such an extent that as many as twenty shows have 
been criticized in print in one week in Great Britain. Competition 
has increased the money value of prize fowls and created a large 
class — almost a profession — who have considerable pecuniary in- 
terests embarked in breeding and exhibiting such birds. This 
professionalism, and the interests at stake, have in turn naturally 
given rise to many proceedings of doubtful character, which it has 
been found needful to keep in check by an organization known 
as the Poultry Club. An enormous multiplication of varieties is 
another phase of this development, nearly all breeds having had 
their older subdivisions supplemented by new colours, produced 
through crossing and skilful selection, amidst which buff or orange, 
now bred in nearly all fowls, has had a curious popularity. While 
formerly the diminutive bantams were confined to a few well- 
marked varieties, all the large breeds of poultry have now been 
dwarfed into bantam size by the skill of breeders. To enter farther 
into this branch of the subject is beyond the scope of the present 
article, but it may be interesting to state that at a public auction in 
1901 one prize fowl was sold for £150. 

Game Fowls. — Game fowls differ less from the wild Bankiva than 
any other variety; they are, however, considerably larger, and carry 
the tail more erect than the wild birds. Game fowls in England 
were long cultivated not only as useful poultry, but on account 
of their combative tendencies for the cock-pit. The comb in the 
game is single, the beak massive, the spurs strong and very sharp. 
There is a tendency towards the assumption of the female plumage 
by the males, ana distinct breeds of " henny " game are known. 
Game are highly esteemed for the table on account of their plumpness, 
the amount 01 the breast-meat, owing to the size of the pectoral 
muscles, being very great, from which cause, combined with their 
hardihood, they are most valuable for crossing with other breeds, as 
the Dorking. English-bred game have been reared of many varieties 
of colour, retaining in all cases their distinctive peculiarities of form. 
Game fowls have been reduced in size by selective breeding, and 
exceedingly minute game bantams have been produced with the 
distinguishing characters of the larger breed. But the long-legged 
and long-necked " stilty " game fowls, which resulted at one time 
from breeding for exhibition purposes, have been again superseded 
in favour of the old and genuine type. 

Cochins. — This type, which must be regarded as including not only 
the birds generally so-called but also the Brahmas and Langshans, 
is of very large size, some of the males reaching the great weight 
of 16 or 17 ffi. They are distinguished by a profusion of downy 
plumage, with small wings and tails; they are incapable of long 
flight, and the pectoral muscles are consequently but feebly 
developed. The Cochins originally imported from Shanghai were 
of several colours; some of the grey birds in America were crossed 
with the grey Chittagong, the Brahmas being the result of the cross, 
and they became established as a pure breed, faithfully reproducing 
their own type. The Langshans, a later importation, have fuller 
breasts and less abundant pi u mage .^ The exaggeration of fluff 
and leg-feather has removed all Cochins — it is to be feared per- 
manently — from amongst popular and useful breeds, and in only 
less degree the Brahma, once the most popular breed of the day. 
On the other hand, new sub-breeds, based upon a cross from one or 
the other of the Asiatic races, have been multiplied and largely bred, 
these being all of smooth-legged type and somewhat less in size. 
A sub- variety of Cochin, raised in America, by crossing with a cuckoo- 
coloured breed long known as Dominiques, became fashionable 
under the name of Plymouth Rocks. They are cuckoo-coloured, 
viz. each feather is marked with transverse grey stripes on a lighter 
ground, and, as in all cuckoo-coloured breeds, the cocks are of the 
same colour as the hens; their legs are not feathered, and the plumage 
is not so loose as that of the more typical Cochins. To the original 
cuckoo-coloured Plymouth Rock have been added buff and white 
varieties; and byj:rossing Cochins and Brahmas with other fowls, 
American breeders produced another useful race of compact form 
with smooth yellow legs, and white feathers laced with black round 
the edges, called the silver-laced Wyandotte, to which were speedily 
added other colours and patterns of plumage. The feathered Lang- 
shan has given rise to the black Orpington with smooth legs; and a 
local cross of Cochin and Dorking prevalent in Lincolnshire, to a 
buff breed with smooth white legs, now called the buff Orpington, 
though quite unrelated to the former. All these are useful for 
table, and good layers. 

Malayan Fowls. — The Malayan type has been long recognized 
as of Eastern origin. The birds are of large size, close and scant in 
plumage, with very long legs and necks. The Gallus giganteus of 
Temminck, which he regarded erroneously as a distinct species, 
belonged to this group, as did the Kulm fowl and the grey Chittagong 
of the United States. The Malays are of savage disposition. Several 



smaller breeds of a somewhat similar type are known as Indian 
Game; some of these, as the Aseels, are of indomitable courage. 
Until the arrival of the so-called Cochin breeds from the north of 
China, Malays were the largest fowls known in Europe and were 
employed to impart size to other varieties by crossing. 

Spanish. — The Spanish or Mediterranean type is well marked. 
The birds are of moderate size, with large single erect combs and 
white ear-lobes. In the black Spanish the whiteness of the ear-lobe 
extends over the face, and its size has been so greatly developed 
by cultivation that in some specimens it is 6 or 7 in. in length and 
several in breadth. Closely related to the Spanish, differing only 
in colour of plumage and extent of white face and ear-lobe, are the 
white and brown Leghorns, the slaty-blue Andalusians, the black 
Minorca s, &c All are non-incubators, the desire to sit having 
been lost in the tendency to the increased production of eggs, which 
has been developed by the persistent and long-continued selection 
of the most fertile layers. The white-faced black Spanish, once the 
most widely kept, has almost disappeared; but the allied red-faced 
Minorca and the blue Andalusian have achieved great popularity as 
free layers of large white eggs; and the yellow-legged Leghorns of 
similar type, though rather smaller, have spread on all sides with 
much multiplication of varieties, the latest of which, with mottled 
black and white plumage, is termed the Ancona. 

Hamburghs. — The Hamburghs, erroneously so called from a name 
given them in the classification adopted at the early Birmingham 
shows, are chiefly breeds of English origin. They have double 
combs and small white ear-lobes. There are various sub-varieties. 
Those with a dark crescent-like mark on the end of each feather of 
the hen are termed Spangled Hamburghs. Others are of uniform 
black plumage. A somewhat similar breed of smaller size, with 
each feather of the hens marked with transverse bands of black 
on a white or bay ground, is termed Pencilled Hamburghs; they were 
formerly known as Dutch Everyday-layers. These breeds arc all non- 
sitters and lay a remarkably large number of eggs. Hamburghs in 
England have been depressed in recent years by the complicated 
system of breeding separate strains for each sex; but there has been 
introduced from Europe the hardy Campine or Braekel, resembling 
the pencilled Hamburgh* in plumage, but larger and with a single 
comb, and laying a large egg in great numbers. 

Crested Fowls. — The crested breeds (n on -incubating) have long been 
cultivated on the continent of Europe and are admirably delineated 
in the pictures by Hondekoeter and other early Dutch artists. In 
Great Britain they are erroneously termed Polish. The develop- 
ment of the feathered crest is accompanied by a great diminution 
in the size of the comb, which is sometimes entirely wanting. The 
wattles also are absent in some breeds, their place being occupied 
by a large tuft of feathers, forming what is termed the " beard." 
In all the crested breeds there is a remarkable alteration of the 
cranium, the anterior part of the skull forming a prominent hollow 
tuberosity which contains a very large part of the brain. This 
portion of the brain-case is rarely entirely ossified. There are 
numerous sub- varieties of crested fowls. The best-known breeds in 
England are the spangled, with a dark mark at the end of each 
feather. This mark often assumes a crescent shape, the horns of 
the crescent sometimes running up each margin of the feather so as 
to form a black border; feathers so marked are termed " laced " by 
poultry-fanciers. There are also white Polish and a buff variety. 
A very distinct sub-variety is the black breed with a white crest 
on the head and large pendent wattles. A variety with the arrange- 
ment of these colours reversed was formerly known, but it has now 
become extinct. Some of the larger breeds of the west of Europe 
are closely related to the Polish. The Creve-cceur is a crested breed 
of uniform black colour; it is of large size and of great value for the 
table and for egg-production. 

The Houdan is a black and white breed of very similar character. 
In some breeds the form of the body and structure of bones of the 
face-closely resemble those of the Polish, but there is an absence of 
the feathered crest, the crescent-shaped comb becoming more largely 
developed; such are those known as Guelders, Bredas, and La Fleche, 
the latter being the best French fowl for eating. A small white- 
crested variety, profusely feathered on the legs, was received about 
1864 from Turkey; they are known as Sultans. The older French 
breeds are less kept than formerly, but a race originated in France 
by crossing Houdans with Dorkings and light Brahmas, and known 
as the Faverolles, is a tender and quick-growing table fowl, and even 
in the Houdan district itself is displacing the Houdan, one of its 
ancestors. The Faverolles have single upright combs, beards and 
whiskers, slightly feathered legs, and five toes on each foot ; and the 
general colour of the hen is salmon or fawn, with an almost white 
breast. 

Dorkings. — The Dorking type includes fowls that have for many 
generations been bred for the supply of the London markets. They 
are all fleshy on the breast and of fine quality. The Dorkings have 
an extra toe, a monstrosity which leads to disease of the feet. The 
Surrey and Sussex fowls are four-toed. The coloured Dorkings were 
greatly increased in size by crossing with an Indian breed of the 
Malay type. The birds of the Dorking type are fair layers and good 
sitters. They are rather delicate in constitution, and arc chiefly 
bred in the south of England. Crossed with the game breed they 
furnish a hardy fowl, plumper than the Dorking and larger than the

Game, which is of unsurpassed excellence for the table. Mating a 
Dorking cock with large game hens is found to be the most advan- 
tageous. 

Silk Fowls. — These constitute a singular variety, in which the 
barbs of tfcc feathers are not connected by barbules and the entire 
plumage has a loose fibrous appearance; similar variations are found 
amongst other species of birds, but arc soon lost in a wild state. 
The silk fowl best known is that in which the plumage is perfectly 
white, whilst the skin, cellular tissue between the muscles, and the 
periosteum covering the bones are a deep blue-black, the comb and 
wattles being a dark leaden blue. The birds are admirable sitters 
and mothers, and are much valued for rearing pheasants, being of 
somewhat small size. Though of remarkable appearance when 
cooked, they are of good quality. In crosses with other breeds the 
silky character of the plumage is generally lost, but the dark skin and 
intermuscular cellular tissue remain and greatly lessen the value of 
the birds in the market. 

Frizzled Fowls are birds in which each feather curls outwards 
away from the body. They arc common in India, but are not 
adapted to the climate of Britain, as the plumage offers an imperfect 
protection against wet. 

Rumpless Fowls are those in which the coccygeal vertebrae are 
absent; there is consequently no tail. By crossing, rumpless breeds 
of any variety may be produced. They are not desirable to cultivate, 
as, from the structural peculiarities, the eggs are very apt to escape 
being fertilized. 

Dumpies or Creepers are birds in which the bones of the legs 
are so short that their progression is considerably interfered with. 
The best known are the Scotch dumpies. 

Lon^-tailed Fowls t under the various names of Yokohama or 
Phoenix fowls, or Shinotawaro fowls, are singular varieties recently 
introduced from Japan, in which the sickle-feathers of the tail are 
6 or 7 ft. long. In Japan they are said to assume a much greater 
length. One bird in the museum at Tokio is stated to have sickle- 
feathers 17 ft. long. In other respects the fowls are not peculiar, 
resembling the birds of the Game type. 

Bantam. — This term is applied to fowls of a diminutive size 
without any reference to the particular breed. By careful selection 
and crossing with small specimens any variety can be reduced to the 
desired size. The Chinese had in the Summer Palace at Peking small 
Cochins weighing not more than 1 lb each. The Japanese have long 
possessed a dwarf breed with enormous tail and comb, and with 
very short legs. One of the most artificial breeds is the Sebright 
bantam, named after its originator. This bird has the laced or 
marginal feather of the Polish combined with the absence of male 
tlumage in the cocks, so that it may be described as a hen-feathered 
reed with laced plumage. When perfect in marking it is of singular 
beauty, but is not remarkable for fertility. 

Most of the modern changes in breeds, broadly speaking, have 
been in the direction of replacing poultry with chiefly fancy 
points by really useful fowls, yet it is noteworthy that they have 
been carried out by fanciers, or breeders for exhibition, proving 
that there has not been that practical antagonism between the 
aims of these breeders and the production of food which some 
have alleged. But there has further been, since 1890 especially, 
a remarkable development of what has been termed " utility " 
poultry-breeding. 

Feeding attd Egg-production. — These aspects of poultry- 
culture are closely connected, and in both such advances have 
been made as almost amount to a revolution. The breeders of 
the United States have led the way, and, though it had first 
been taught in England, were the first to practise generally 
the systematic breeding, year after # year, from the best layers 
only. It had always been known that some hens would lay 
from 150 to 200 eggs in a year whilst many did not exceed 100, 
and some laid much less. This was tested (on a better stock than 
the average) at the Maine experimental station in 1 898-1 899, 
260 pullets being selected, of which 5 died and 19 were stolen. 
Of the remainder, 39 laid 160 eggs each or more, and 22 less than 
100, the rest coming between these figures; the five best laid 200, 
201, 204, 206 and 208 eggs in twelve months, and the three 
worst only 36, 37 and 38 in the same time. From such figures 
the money value of selective breeding is apparent. As a proof 
of what may be done by systematic breeding, one American 
breeder obtained an average of 196 eggs per annum from as 
many as 600 white Leghorns, and another 194 eggs from 140 
Plymouth Rocks; greater numbers have been obtained from 
single birds or small pens of fowls, but these are results from 
considerable flocks. 

It has been proved, however, that such averages as these 
cannot be obtained unless they are fed for as well as bred for.

The most successful egg-farmers now feed their poultry on 
definite " rations," compounded so as to give what is termed a 
proper " nutritive ratio," or proportion of albuminoids to 
carbonaceous material. The basis of such feeding is analysis 
of foodstuffs, in some form which shows simply their percentages 
of albuminoids, fats or hydrocarbons, carbohydrates (starch, 
sugar, &c), salts, crude husk or fibre, and water. Fats, being 
relatively much richer in carbon than the starch compounds, 
are generally multiplied by 2*25, and this product added 
instead to the carbohydrates; then the ratio of albuminoids or 
nitrogenous matter to this total of carbonaceous compounds is 
the " nutritive ratio." The following is a useful table of 
analyses made out in this way, taken from The Book of Poullry: —

Many writers have introduced unnecessary complication into 
a very simple matter. Some elaborately compute the amount of 
11 dry matter," which is needless if our analyses show the proportion 
of water, as above. Others have calculated " digestibility," on the 
theory that food not rejected as excrement is " retained in the'body." 
This theory has a basis in the case of animals which consume a large 
amount of hard indigestible fibre, excreted in such a form as horse 
manure; but fowls macerate all they eat in the crop, and grind it in 
the gizzard, and in their case the excreta represent very little 
undigested food, but mainly the final result of the vital processes, 
and of food usefully employed in carrying these on. We may be 
sure that we more than allow for any factor of indigestibility if 
we merely leave out any crude husk or fibre, giving that to the 
fowl for whatever it is worth, and calculate our ratio direct from 
the figures of the table. 

Two extremely simple cases will suffice as examples of the modern 
method. ^ Potatoes are often cheap', but on account of their starchy 
composition require a " balance, and the same may be said of 
maize: one method of balancing each will show what is meant and 
the simplicity of the calculation. We will take potatoes and bran 
first.

next to the maize, let us suppose that it is desired to feed this as

" mash " or soft mixture in the morning. One way would be as 
follows : —

This ration explains how in such a case we must multiply the figures 
for maize by 3, and those for oats by 2, being^ the proportions we are 
taking to one portion of horse-flesh. The ratio of this dietary comes 
out slightly lower than 1 :aJ. 

The proper rat jo for feeding fowls has received much discussion. 
Dietetic authorities mostly agree that about 1 : 5 is the best for 
maintenance of animal life generally, and more specifically that there 
should be of albuminoids about 18 parts in 100, of fats 7 and carbo- 
hydrates 75. That should suffice for growing; chickens; but it 
is fairly obvious that fowls fattening may require more fat, while 
the constant production of eggs, whose high ratio is shown in the 
analyses, must require a larger amount of albuminoids. This fact 
is indicated by the hen herself, which when laying devours large 
earthworms, usually rejected with disgust at other times. She 
shows by this appetite how specially she needs albumen; and fowls 
on a wide range, though only fed with corn, may thus in summer 
" balance " a dietary for themselves by the worms and insects 
which they procure- When they cannot do this, more albumen 
must be supplied, and the general opinion of practical egg-farmers 
has tended towards a ratio of 1 : 4 or 1 : ^1 for hens in full lay. 
One successful American breeder feeds as high as 1 13, and states 
that his results have been best at that figure. 

Passing from theory, the greatest practical advance in poultry- 
feeding has probably been the discovery of the benefit to be 
derived from dividing the extra supply of albumen between 
'fresh bones cut up small in a mill (known amongst breeders as 
" cut bone ") and such green food as clover or cabbage. The 
bones contain a good proportion of fat, and of mineral salts also, 
which careful experiments have shown to be of great importance 
both in egg-production and for growing stock. Green food had 
until recently been looked upon chiefly as a corrective, or neces- 
sity for health, though it was known that fowls on a pasture 
grazed largely. But the nutritive ratio of clover is as high as 
1:3, and American poultry-farmers now use it largely as really 
albuminous food, to promote laying. Its use in this way also 
allows more animal food to be used without ill effect; and to this 
free use of clover and cut bone in conjunction the improved 
results upon American egg-farms are largely due. The following 
is the " mash " ration on a successful American egg-farm, and 
represents a high forcing diet: middlings or sharps 100 lb, maize- 
meal 75 lb, gluten-meal (a highly nitrogenous by-product of 
American flour-milling) 25 lb, clover-meal 80 lb, meat-meal 
35 lb, all weighed dry, mixed with boiling water in the evening, 
and kept covered all night. 

The majority of poultry-farmers give their stock each day 
one feed of grain, and one of soft meal-food or " mash," but by 
no means agree as to the times for these meals. In England, 
morning mash and evening grain are almost universal, the latter 
giving more support during the long fast at night, and the former 
more rapid recuperation on cold mornings. But in America 



and Canada, where the climate compels confinement of the fowls 
for months together in enclosed sheds, health and eggs can only 
be secured by constant " scratching," to promote which the 
grain is scattered amongst loose litter spread several inches deep. 
Many, therefore, prefer to scatter the grain in the morning and 
feed the mash at night, alleging that a good breakfast of mash 
makes the fowls lazy, with bad results. Others state that this 
is avoided by a rather scantier morning feed of mash, with a 
slight sprinkle of grain in the litter afterwards. In 1890 a 
careful experiment was made by the Massachusetts Agricultural 
College, two similar lots of pullets being fed upon similar food, 
on the two plans, for two periods of several months each, in 
summer and winter seasons, and each lot receiving, besides the 
morning and evening feeds, a slight sprinkle of millet in the 
litter, to promote exercise. In egg-production there was 
scarcely any difference, what little there w T as being in favour of 
the morning mash; and the birds thus fed became also somewhat 
the heaviest. The most remarkable result was that the weight 
of manure voided in the night was nearly double in the case of 
the evening-mash birds, showing the rapid digestion of mash 
food. 

Artificial Incubation and Rearing. — In the separate article on 
Incubator, details are given concerning the appliances used in 
artificial hatching and rearing, and the subject may be only 
briefly treated here. 

Even in England the eggs hatched in incubators now probably 
equal, or nearly equal, those hatched under hens: in America 
the wide practice of artificial incubation is difficult to realize. 
Of small-sized machines one Illinois maker sold 14,800 in 1899; 
and in regard to large sizes, in 1900 at least seven names and 
addresses were known of operators who each used from 55 to as 
many as 85 machines, every machine holding 300 or more eggs: 
somewhat smaller plants were of course far more numerous. 
Experience on such a vast scale has led to a practical advance 
of considerable importance. While in England it is still usual 
to effect empirical adjustment of ventilation and moisture, the 
better American incubators now dispense with direct moisture 
altogether. It was remembered that the hen hatches without 
moisture, and equally so the egg-ovens of Egypt; the absence of 
direct air-current, and consequently of any rapid evaporation, 
being the obvious explanation. The manufacturers therefore 
set themselves to slow the movement of the air; and when this 
object was effectually accomplished, it was found that there 
was no need for moisture, and that the chicks also hatched out 
stronger and in higher proportion. The general opinion in 
the United States, where many farmers tested both hens and 
machines on a large scale, whilst still undecided between them, is 
that the proceeds of artificial incubation are superior by about 
10%, and this is based upon hatches of thousands annually. 

Artificial hatching necessitates artificial brooding, and in this 
also great changes have taken place, any real success in rearing 
having been for some years far behind that in hatching. The 
method universally attempted at first might be called the 
" coverlet " system, nestling material such as strips of flannel or 
wool, warmed from above, being provided for the chicks to 
nestle under, as they do under the feathers of the hen. Many 
were reared in this way, but failures were also terribly general, 
and these were ultimately traced to confinement and pollution 
and heating and rebreathing of the air, caused by the nestling 
material. That system is now abandoned, warmed but open 
chambers being provided, which the chicks use at pleasure, but 
which have no coverlet to rest upon their bodies. In some, 
heated pipes traverse the upper part of the chamber, some 
inches above the chicks; in others a warm iron plate radiates 
heat in the same way; in others warmed air is brought in by 
flues or openings; in some small ones the lamp itself burns in 
the chamber of the brooder: but the principle is common to 
all of a warmed shelter, open above, and generally with an outer 
chamber also, sheltered but not heated, which breaks the transi- 
tion to the open air outside. In America a very large propor- 
tion of the chickens reared are brought up till hardy in the large 
" brooder-houses " mentioned below. 



POULTRY AND POULTRY-FARMING 



217 



Poultry-farming. — Poultry-farming in a practical sense is 
now carried on somewhat extensively in various ways, under- 
* standing that term to include any case where poultry-culture 
is carried on for substantial profit, or as an important interest 
of the holding, beyond the mere breeding of prize birds for 
exhibition. The difficulty never had been, as some have stated, 
in ground getting tainted or rent costing too much. It is now 
well understood that in the English climate 100 birds per acre 
must not be exceeded, though it is far better to confine them to 
one-half or one-third of the space, while some crop is got off 
the remainder when they go yearly to absolutely fresh ground. 
The mere rent of an acre is not much for 100 fowls, but the real 
difficulty was and is that a fowl is such a small unit, entailing 
constant liability to small losses and wastes, and necessity for 
labour and oversight out of proportion. Hence at a time when 
100 eggs per annum was thought a fair return for each bird, and 
there was but a poor and uncertain market for them, this 
difficulty was insuperable. A very different average production 
would now be worked for; while, on the other hand, the greater 
crowding into cities, and growing appreciation of eggs as an 
article of diet, have caused a market for " new-laid " eggs, at 
good prices which previously did not exist. It is these changes 
which have altered the conditions. 

The chief development in England at the beginning of the 
20th century was a very large increase in the poultry kept upon 
farms. Formerly very few were kept, looked after casually by 
the mistress or a boy, and only expected to provide for the house- 
hold and occasionally a few shillings in cash, while any food 
expressly fed to them was grudged. It has now been taught all 
over the country, by lecturers under the county council tech- 
nical instruction committees, that poultry pay best of any 
branch upon a farm. It has become generally known that, 
provided they can be run over the farm by using detached 
houses, and not huddled together, a dozen hens per acre can 
be kept upon a holding without interfering with any other 
stock ; indeed, the curious fact is observed that horses and cattle 
prefer to graze over grass that might be thought soiled by the 
fowls. Where the statement was once derided, it is now a 
commonplace of county council lecturers, that the additional 
manure thus made is really worth to the farm from sixpence 
per bird per annum for small breeds to as much as one shilling 
for very large ones. Out of a large number of similar instances 
collected in 1900, one specimen may be given. In Worcester- 
shire 210 fowls had the run of 100 acres, lots of 20 to 30 being 
kept in detached houses. From 20,000 to 25,000 eggs per 
annum were marketed, and 150 to 200 chickens, the food 
averaging about £40, and the cash return £90 to £100. The 
almost universal opinion is that the manure pays for the labour, 
and that the annual profit averages from 4s. to 5s. 6d. per head. 
Poultry-farming on a larger scale than this is also carried on 
in connexion with the Sussex fattening industry, presently 
described. That was until recently a separate business, chickens 
heing bought from neighbouring small rearers, or imported 
from Ireland, to go directly into fattening cages; and it has 
often been stated that rearing and fattening together were 
incompatible. This was so far true that the manure made by 
numbers of fattening poultry was very considerable, and had to 
be used upon a small holding kept in order to use it; such a 
holding, therefore, received as much as it could possibly bear, 
and was thereby " sickened " for live poultry running at large. 
But with an extra holding or larger holding this is not the case, 
and increasing competition and the desire for the two profits 
have led to a large amount of rearing and fattening combined. 
In 1894 one of the officers of the agricultural commission found 
8000 chickens being reared and fattened annually on one farm 
of 200 acres, and this proved only a pioneer: in 1900 he found 
(amongst many such instances) 4000 reared upon 80 acres, 
1500 upon 22 acres and 5000 upon an extra holding (taken for 
the purpose) of 40 acres. In most 'cases the main cereal crop 
was oats, to be fed to the fowls; and some cows were kept, the 
skim milk from which was used in the same way; but the poultry 
was the controlling interest of the whole. 



On any such scale as this the manure becomes of great impor- 
tance. About 1880 Dr Augustus Voclcker, chemist to the Royal 
Agricultural Society, made the following analysis of two samples, 
one moist or fresh dropped, the other freed from much moisture 
by storing under cover for four weeks: —

Valued in the usual way, Dr Voelcker found that the moist 
manure was worth £2 per ton, and the drier stored manure 
£4 4s. per ton; but though the figures were indisputable, for 
many years such manure was practically unsaleable. Gradually 
in Sussex it became saleable at 6d. per bushel, and in 1900 some 
of the smaller fatters were selling it at prices varying from 4s. 
to 15s. per load; the larger men either used it themselves or 
obtained higher prices. 

Really large poultry-farms are few in England, and to 
give quite recent facts would be to run the risk that they 
might prove ephemeral. It has been supposed that the 
common experience is failure after two years' trial, but 
this is unduly pessimistic. Even in 1901 two farms in 
Berkshire were setting eggs from over 2000 and 3000 laying 
hens; and there was one farm in the west of England, 
occupying 300 acres with the poultry (besides a shorthorn 
herd and other branches), which had a stock of 5000 
pullets for laying, and had been in existence four years, 
a large capital amounting to thousands of pounds having 
been sunk in it. The owner explained that two years was the 
critical period, simply because for about that time there were 
practically no returns, and that in his case he had only " turned 
the corner " after three years. Though a practical man 
already, he had begun in a small way with one incubator and 
training one man; gradually extending, building up his own 
market, organizing his own selling agency, and building a mill 
to grind his own grain. Only such gradual extension by 
practical men can ever lead to success. 

Besides the breeding of prize poultry, the changes mentioned 
in the early portion of this article have led to another class of 
breeding directed to the supply of pure races frpm good stock, 
but bred mainly for purposes of utility. The demand for such 
stock, at fair prices, though far below those for prize stock, is 
a good index of the development of the poultry industry. The 
establishments which supply it furnish eggs for hatching, or 
stock birds, or newly hatched chickens, which are now hatched 
in incubators and sold by thousands when only one day old, at 
which age they travel without needing food. Some of such 
establishments are quite large. One in Yorkshire occupies 
43 acres solely devoted to this business. 

Poultry-farming has reached its fullest development in the 
United States, owing no doubt to the apparently inexhaustible 
market; butcher's meat being far less eaten than in England, 
and poultry and eggs to a large extent replacing it as national 
food. More especially is there an enormous demand for small 
chickens, known as " broilers," weighing from 1 J lb to 2 lb only, 
destined to be split in half and broiled on a gridiron. These 
birds being unfattened, and ready at ten or twelve weeks, give 
a quick turnover with less expense and risk than older fatted 
birds; and this peculiar demand has largely dominated American 
poultry-farming, a great deal of which runs in the direction of 
great " broiler-plants " solely devoted to the hatching and rear- 
ing of these broilers, while large " brooder-houses," similar to 
those used in that business, are prevalent on more miscellaneous 
farms. The broiler business started at Hammonton in New 
Jersey about 1 880-1 8S5, when plant after plant was rapidly 
erected, some of which have since shut down; but many others 



2l8 



POULTRY AND POULTRY-FARMING 



have taken their place, and some of the originals are still running. 
The chicks are all hatched in incubators (many plants running 
from 20 to 40 machines), and then transferred to long " brooder- 
houses," built with a corridor all along one side, the rest being 
divided into successive pens for the chickens. These latter are 
moved along every few days to the next of the pens, which are 
arranged so as to give rather more space as the birds grow 
larger. Each pen has next the corridor a " hover " or brooding- 
shelter. These have no nestling material, but only a roof or cover 
somewhat to retain the heat, closed by a curtain cut into strips 
in front; and are warmed by hot-water pipes running along the 
building. Generally these pipes run some inches above the chicks 
reposing on the floor, and are set rather on a slant, so as to be 
higher for the bigger chicks in the larger pens; but in some cases 
they run under the floor, and warm the air which enters under the 
hovers.- Every hover, with its inmates, can be reached from the 
corridor at the back of all. In many cases the chickens are 
confined in these small pens until large enough, the floors being 
littered and regularly cleaned; but some raisers have also small 
outside yards which they use in fine weather. The mortality 
in nearly all plants is great, as might be supposed. There are 
said to be some at Hammonton which only market 30% of the 
eggs incubated, yet pay a modest profit at that, which is 
allowed for. On the one hand, a broiler realizes about four 
times the cost of its own hatching and food; on the other hand, 
the labour is very heavy and the loss considerable: these factors 
obviously give a very wide margin of possibilities as regards 
success or failure. 

The most remarkable establishment of this kind, embody- 
ing some novel features, was erected in Ohio at the end of 1896 
by J. Loughlin. The plant cost over $60,000, and was 
designed to market 250 to 300 broilers per day regularly, weigh- 
ing 1 1 lb each, which were sold alive to one large dealer at 
$3 per dozen. Each day an average of 450 eggs were started, 
the chicks from which went into one pen. For the chicks, while 
small, there were 30 small pens, each with 5 by 10 ft. of 
floor space, or at the rate of six chickens per sq. foot; and 
there were 60 larger pens each 8 by 12 ft. with outer runs to 
each of 8 by 20 ft. Every day the chickens were marketed from 
the ninetieth pen, and all the rest moved one pen forward, 
leaving the first small pen vacant for the day's hatch: thus fully 
22,000 birds were in the plant at one time. 

In more general American poultry-farms the same system of 
" brooder-houses " largely prevails, and from many great 
numbers of broilers are sent to market; but as both heart and 
liver are perceptibly affected by such rearing, birds intended 
for stock are either taken out of doors early, or reared in detached 
brooders, as in England. Some establishments are mainly egg- 
farms, high averages being obtained by the system before 
described. Many breeders have a high reputation for their 
stock as layers, and derive large profit from selling stock or eggs 
to other farms. There are many immense duck-farms or 
" ranches," as mentioned below, which sell nothing except 
stock ducks or market ducklings. A great many combine the 
breeding and sale of exhibition poultry with some or all of these 
ohjects, fancy points being on the whole less distinct from useful 
qualities than in England, and the farmer and exhibitor far more 
commonly combined. 

As a rule, American poultry-farmers employ long ranges of 
buildings divided into pens or houses, with enclosed yards in 
front; and the most remarkable fact is that interest can be 
paid upon the capital sunk in such buildings. The explanation 
in some cases is that much is put up by personal labour, while 
the cheapness of land and feed are also favourable. But the 
climatic conditions also differ. During the winter months the 
birds have to be confined in what are called " scratching-sheds," 
and American farmers have successfully reduced to a system 
the keeping of them healthy and in profit by scratching amongst 
litter in a small space. During this period the outer runs 
sweeten and recuperate; smaller runs therefore suffice, and the 
stock is kept closer and more compact. Another system is 
pursued, more especially about Rhode Island, called the " colony " 



plan; detached rough houses, holding forty or fifty hens each, 
being scattered over the farm: there may be a hundred houses, 
but there is no fencing. This is very economical in buildings, 
but expensive in the labour of feeding and collecting eggs, and 
the system is only possible near the sea or where there is little 
snow. In several cases it has been abandoned for the system 
of housing and scratching-sheds. 

There are a few very large establishments indeed in the United 
States, combining almost every branch. At the Meadow Brook 
Farm in Pennsylvania, occupying 80 acres, the buildings total 
112,000 sq. ft. under cover, and the farm has sent to market 
in one year 25,000 chickens and 20,000 ducklings, besides selling 
many stock birds, and an enormous number of eggs for hatch- 
ing at an average price of $40 per 1000. Businesses like this 
are very exceptional; but farms on a* more moderate scale 
are numerous, and intelligent American farmers reckon to make 
a profit of a dollar per annum for each head of their laying or 
breeding stock. 

Table Poultry. — National taste governs the market for table 
poultry to a large extent. In England white meat, skin and legs 
are preferred, and at one time black legs or yellow skin were heavily 
discounted. More knowledge has largely removed that prejudice, 
but white has a market value still. In France exceedingly white and 
smooth skin is preferred, but buyers are indifferent to black legs. 
In America yellow skin and legs are actually preferred, such fowls 
being thought more juicy ; but there has been some tendency towards 
white meat of late. Belgian feeders think the best result follows 
from crossing a yellow-skinned race upon a white-fleshed one. It is 
some confirmation of this idea that one of the best English table 
fowls is the produce of a^ cross between Dorkings and the yellow- 
skinned Indian game, while other similar instances might be cited. 
For some years past the quality of British table poultry has been 
shown by displays of plucked birds in connexion with the Christmas 
Smithfield Cattle Show. For many years France had a reputation 
for greatly surpassing British production; and as the best French 
fowls readily sell for £1 each and more in the Paris market, it would 
not be surprising if they were superior to such as have to be sold 
for 15s. per couple. French fatters appear to seek and obtain a 
smooth whiteness of fat under the skin — almost like that of a bladder 
of lard — which does not find favour in the British market; but the 
best judges have considered that the finest English specimens staged 
were equal to all comers, and some realized high prices. Foreign 
experts, equally with English, admit that England has now 
little to learn from any foreign feeders. 

The chief supply of the best fowls for the London market has long 
come from the Sussex district whose centre is Heathfield : these are 
termed " Surrey " fowls, though Surrey now sends few in comparison. 
This local industry has been founded in a curious way upon the 
" ground oats " of the district, the whole grain being ground up, 
husk and all, nearly as fine as flour. This is done by a peculiar local 
dressing of the stones, which are " stitched " into little pits by a 
pointed pick, instead of being dressed into narrow grooves, as for 
flour-milling; and this meal is found specially suitable for feeding 
and fattening poultry. In early times cottagers crammed a few 
fowls with pellets of meal dipped in milk, but this method is now 
quite superseded by machine cramming, a rubber tube from the 
machine being introduced into the crop of each fowl, and a stroke 
of the foot on a pedal squeezing out a ration of thin, almost creamy, 
paste, composed of the ground oats, fat and sour skim-milk, a food 
which puts on flesh fast and makes it white and delicate. Great 
experience is required in this business. When killed and plucked, 
the fowls are placed in a trough whilst still warm, close side by side, 
and their backs and breasts pressed closer together by a board loaded 
with heavy weights. This combination of fattening and subsequent 
shaping constitutes the Sussex system, which is extending in some 
other parts of England; many excellent fowls, well fed, but unfat- 
tened, are also supplied from Lincolnshire (known as " Bostons ") 
and other districts. The largest provincial towns have similar sup- 
plies in less degree. 

In America larger fowls are called " roasters," to distinguish them 
from the broilers above described; and there has grown up in the 
eastern states a system of rearing these also in confinement. Hatch- 
ing them begins in September, and the birds are at first reared in 
brooder-houses; but when large enough are placed about fifty 
together in small houses, with 6 by 8 ft. of floor, in small yards 
about 20 ft. square. One very successful raiser puts 200 birds into 
one pen 10 by 17 ft., in a warmed house, where they remain till 
killed at 7 lb or 8 lb weight. One firm had raised in this way, for 
seven years in succession, 2000 birds per annum upon half an acre 
of ground, but occasionally there is serious mortality in this kind 
of business, and as a rule only 60% are reared of those hatched, 
the loss of the rest being averaged and allowed for. 

In western Europe there is some demand for chickens fattened 
quite young, weighing only 8 oz. to 12 oz. each, and known as petits 
pousstns, or " milk chickens." In Belgium somewhat older ones, 



POULTRY AND POULTRY-FARMING

weighing up to 1 J lb, arc sold as poulcts de grains. The demand for 
such birds in England is small, and confined to the West End of 
London, the flesh being too excessively tender for average English 
palates. Birds of similar sizes have lately been finding a market 
in the United'States, as '* squab broilers," but are splitand broiled, 
and not fattened, the difference being that a whole bird is served 
for one portion. m 

Turkeys.— The varieties of the turkey (q.v.) differ chiefly as 
to colour. The principal English breeds are the bronze or Cam- 
bridge, the black or Norfolk, the fawn and the white. Of these 
the first, especially when crossed with the American, is the 
largest and most desirable. 

Turkey-breeding has been largely dominated by the magnificent 
American bronze breed, derived from wild blood, and distinguished 
for size and weight. There is some question whether it does pot 
require more space and fresher ground than the older English strains, 
and may not be more delicate on small holdings. French birds 
come largely to the Christmas market in London, but, as compared 
with English, are small. The chicks, when hatched after twenty- 
eight days' incubation, should be left undisturbed for twenty-four 
or thirty hours, during which time they are digesting the yolk that 
is absorbed into the intestinal canal at birth. No attempt should 
be made to cram them; their first food should consist of sweet 
fresh meal, soft custard made with equal parts of egg and milk 
set by a gentle heat, and, above all, abundance of some bitter 
milky herb, as dandelion, or, much better, lettuce running to seed, 
on which they can be reared successfully with very little food of any 
other description. The young turkeys progress much better if the 
hen has the range of a small enclosure from the firstthan if she is 
confined to a coop; thus reared they are much hardier than when 
cooped and corn-fed, and not so susceptible to injury from slight 
showers; but a damp locality should be avoided. Turkey-hens 
are most persevering sitters, and are employed in France to hatch 
successions of sittings of hens' eggs. Turkeys can often be most 
advantageously reared by cottagers, as one or two hens only can be 
kept, one visit to the male being sufficient to fertilize the entire batch 
of eggs. The young turkeys find a larger proportion of their own 
food than fowls, and with a good free range cost but little until they 
are ready for fattening for the table. In places where the oppor- 
tunity serves they may be allowed to roost in the trees with great 
advantage. Some wild flocks treated like pheasants are to be found 
in several of the large parks in Scotland as well as in England. 

Guinea-fowls. — The guinea-fowl (q.v.) may be successfully 
reared in any dry locality provided it has a good range and trees 
in which to roost. The hen lays an abundance of eggs, which 
are generally hidden. The birds are useful as furnishing a supply 
of poultry for the table in the interval that ensues between the 
time when game are out of season and that before chickens arrive 
at maturity. On a dry, sandy and chalky soil and in a warm 
situation they are reared with ease, but are quite unsuited to 
damp, cold localities. The continued vociferation of the hen- 
birds renders their maintenance near a house very objectionable, 
as the cry is continued throughout great part of the night. 
Several variations of colour exist, but they do not. require any 
detailed description. 

Ducks. — All the varieties of the domesticated duck are 
descended from the common mallard or wild duck, Anas boschas, 
a species which, though timid in its wild state, is easily domesti- 
cated, and suffers changes of form and colour in a few genera- 
tions. The most important breeds are: the Rouen, which, 
retaining the colour of the original species, grows to a large 
size; the Aylesbury, a large white breed with an expanded lemon- 
coloured bill; the Peking, a white breed with a pale yellowish 
tint in the plumage, and a very bright orange bill; two breeds 
which are entirely black. The smaller of these, which has been 
bred down to a very diminutive size, is remarkable for the extreme 
lustre of its feathers and the fact that its eggs are covered 
with a dark black pigment, which becomes less in quantity 
as each successive egg is deposited. It is known by the equally 
absurd names of East Indian, Labrador or Buenos Aires duck. 
The larger black variety, the Cayuga duck, has been introduced 
into England. Decoy or call ducks are small breeds of a very 
loquacious character, which were originally bred for the 
purpose of attracting the wild birds to the decoys. Some are 
of the natural colour, others are white. Amongst the less known 
breeds are the Duclair ducks of France, evidently the result 
of crossing white and coloured varieties. Among the breeds 
differing in structure may be mentioned the Indian Runner 



duck, formerly called Penguin duck from its erect attitude, 
the hook-billed and the tufted ducks, &c. During the last 
fifteen years of the 19th century the first of these became very 
popular in England as a hardy forager and good layer, many 
birds laying 150 to 180 eggs in a year. It is small in body but 
good in flavour, and is a great favourite in many districts. 

Formerly the greater number of ducklings came to the London 
market from the Vale of Aylesbury. This trade still continues, 
but the adherence of the Aylesbury duckcrs to old-fashioned methods, 
and the increasing demand, has led to great competition in other 
districts, such as Norfolk, Lancashire, Kent, &c. Some of the new 
duck-farmers market 10,000 to 15,000 annually, mostly hatched in 
incubators, and never allowed in the water or out of the small rearing- 
pens. In America, however, this kind of rearing has found its 
fullest development, the number who raise 10,000 ducklings or more 
being considerable, and a few sending to market, as above indicated, 
very large numbers indeed, requiring 40 to 80 incubators to keep 
up the supply. It is remarkable that while in England the Aylesbury 
is generally preferred, in America the Peking duck is universally 
used, and has been made by selection both larger and a better layer. 
Some duck-farmers in England have, however, also adopted the 
Peking. By good feeding the ducks are caused to lay in the winter 
months, when the eggs are hatched under hens, the young ducklings 
being reared in artificially warmed buildings or in the labourers' 
cottages; they are fed most liberally on soft food, soaked grits, 
boiled rice with tallow-melters' greaves, and in ten or twelve weeks 
are fit for the market; if killed before moulting their quills, which 
they do when about twelve weeks old, they are heavier than after- 
wards and much better eating. When ducklings are required for 
the early spring markets the old birds must be fed most freely to 
cause the production of eggs in cold weather, corn being given 
in vessels of water, and the birds must be shut up at night, or the 
eggs will be laid in the water, where they sink and become putrid. 
Duck-rearing is a very profitable industry, very highprices being 
paid for ducklings in the early months of the year. The so-called 
Muscovy duck is a Brazilian species, Cairina moschata, which is not 
reared for the market, although the young birds are edible. The 
drake not unfrequently mates with the common duck, and large 
but sterile hybrids are the result. 

Geese. — The domestic goose (q.v.) of Europe is undoubtedly 
the descendant of the migratory Graylag goose, Anser cinereus y 
from which it differs chiefly by its increased size. Although 
domesticated since the time of the Romans, it has not been sub- 
ject to much variation. The most important breeds are the 
large grey variety known as the Toulouse, the white breed known 
as the Embden, and the common variety frequently marked with 
dark feathers on the back, and hence termed " saddlebacks." 
After the Crimean War a Russian variety w r as introduced into 
England in which the feathers are singularly elongated, and even 
curled and twisted; this breed, termed the Sebastopol, is of small 
size and more important as a fanciers' breed than from a practical 
point of view. In some countries a second species is domesti- 
cated; it is usually termed the Chinese, knob-fronted or swan 
goose, Anser cygnoides. Though perfectly distinct as a species, 
having a different number of vertebrae in the neck and a loud 
clanging voice, it breeds freely with the common goose, and the 
hybrids produced are perfectly fertile. 

Geese in England are declining in relative popularity. In Germany 
they are consumed to an enormous extent, and the British consul- 
general at Berlin reports that even the large domestic supplies 
have to be supplemented by considerable imports from Russia, a 
special " goose-train " of fifteen to forty cars arriving daily from 
the Russian frontier at that city. In America there has been in- 
creased interest in goose-breeding, and in the Chinese goose 
especially, which has been largely bred (with some trifling peculiari- 
ties) under the name of the African goose, and crossed with the 
Embden and Toulouse. The produce of this African cross is con- 
sidered very fertile and profitable to rear. 

Geese are much more exclusively vegetable feeders than ducks, 
and can only be kept to profit where they can obtain a large propor- 
tion of their food by grazing. The old birds should not be killed off, 
as they continue^ fertile to a great age. Geese are readily fattened 
on oats thrown into water, and the young, when brought rapidly 
forward for the markets, afford a very good profit. The Chinese, if 
well fed, lay at a much earlier date than the common species, and, 
if their eggs are hatched under, large Cochin hens, giving three or 
four to each bird, the young are ready for the table at a very early 

Ceriod. The nest, as in all cases of ground-nesting birds, should 
e made on the earth and not in boxes, which become too dry and 
over-heated. In breeding for the market or for the sake of profit, 
the very large exhibition birds should be avoided, as many are barren 
from over-fatness, and none are so prolific as birds of fair average size.

From such figures the conclusion might be drawn that foreign 
eggs were "ousting" British to a formidable extent; but such a 
conclusion is dispelled when we take into consideration questions of 
price and nationality. Imported eggs are of very different qualities 
and prices, France averaging for the year 1900, 7s. 7jd. per 120, 
Denmark 7s. 6fd., Belgium 6s. 2d., Germany 5s. 9id. and Russia 
5s. 6d., many of the latter being almost putrid when sold in England, 
and chiefly used in manufactures, for which, at a low price, they 
answer perfectly. Many eggs are sent from Russia to Germany, 
Belgium and even Denmark, so that some of these also come from 
her, at an original price with which no British producer could com- 
pete. A steady decline in imports of the higher priced French eggs, 
and an enormous increase of low-priced eggs, explain the drop in 
average price from 8s. 7d. per 120 in 1874 to 6s. 5$d. in 1900; and 
were this all, the inference would be simply that the selling price of 
eggs had fallen. But this is not so. While the higher priced 
foreign eggs have thus been largely displaced from the market, 
there has grown up a very large demand for British " new-laid " 
eggs, at prices much higher than any of the above. There is a 
wholesale market for such eggs in London. The lowest price (in May) 
for 1900 was 7s. 6d. to 8s. 6d., and the highest (in December) 
19s. to 20s. per 120. The quantity of reputed " new-laid " British 
eggs now sold is enormous, and has grown up in the face of foreign 
imports, the native producer selling in spite of them, and at far better 
prices, many times more than he did, say, in 1875.

The total for 1900 thus amounted to £1,010,360. The imports from 
France and Belgium are largely for the Christmas market. Those 
from Russia are chiefly very small fowls wrapped in paper and packed 
in cases of a hundred each, which come over frozen, to be sold at 
is. 2d. or is. 3d. each. Other sources include America, Canada 
and Australia, which have been sending smaller but increasing 
quantities of larger birds, packed in smaller numbers, and which 
realize 2 s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. each, a few of the largest as much as 4s. each. 
Such supplies have somewhat affected the Sussex fattening industry, 
necessitating the production of a lower class of bird at a lower price 
and narrower margin; but they look rough and inferior in colour, 
and chiefly supply restaurant and hotel demand. The foreign 
birds being cold-storage goods, which must be consumed quickly 
when taken out, a fresh Sussex fowl of the same weight will always 
sell for considerably more. 

There are no statistics of British" poultry; in Ireland they are 
collected. The year 1851 closed a decade in which the number of 
holdings under ten acres had decreased enormously, and the number 
of poultry in Ireland was then returned as 7,470,694. In 1889 
this number had doubled to 14,856,517, and in 1899 there were 
18,233,520. The Irish Agricultural Organization Society is doing 
much to improve breeds and management, and the packing of eggs, 
pf which Ireland isa considerable exporter to Great Britain. There 
is also now a considerable export of lean chickens for fattening to 



Sussex and other parts of England, and a smaller number have also 
been fattened in Ireland. 

In Australia most of the federated states have a produce export 
department, which receives eggs and dead poultry into cold storage 
and ships to London, managing, if desired, the whole business. That 
of South Australia shipped a good many eggs to England in 1895, 
but the temperature was found too low for eggs, and this trade has 
so far not developed. Dead poultry come in a similar way from 
West Australia and Victoria to London. In New South Wales such 
arrangements have inaugurated a small export business which seems 
the most active of any, and more seems known about the poultry 
industry in this state than in others. The government statistician 
estimated the number kept in 1900 at 3,180,000 fowls, 320,000. 



ducks, 234,000 turkeys and 97,000 geese, the annual consumption 
;ing about three-fourths of this, and of eggs about 97,000,000. 
In Canada the government makes considerable effort to encourage 



poultry. It has established several stations where systematic 
fattening of chickens in the English manner is taught, and official 
experiments are also made on the results of various feeding-rations 
and other matters. From these stations shipments of fatted chickens 
were first made to Liverpool and London, commencing an export 
trade which shows signs of growth. 

The poultry industry in the United States is the most gigantic 
in the world. By the census of 1900, which tabulates returns from 
5,096,252 out of the 5,739,657 farms in the States, the number of 
fowls over three months old on the 1st of June 1900 was returned 
as 233,598,085, with 6,599,367 turkeys, 5,676,863 geese, and 4,807,358 
ducks, or 250,681,673 birds in all, valued at 85,794,996 dollars. 
This, however, would include very few of the chickens raised that 
year, which would not have reached the age stated, and mainly 
represents breeding and laying stock, which thus averages about 
49 birds to every holding; it also of necessity omits many of the 
smaller city-lot raisers. The value of the poultry raised during the 
whole year 1899 is given as 136,891,877 dollars, and of the eggs , 
produced (1,293,819,186 dozen) at 144,286,186 dollars; a total year's 
product of over £56,000,000. Adding only a very moderate amount 
for city-lot and other small producers not making return, the poultry 
industry in America exceeded in value either the wheat crop, or 
swine or cotton crop. 

The importance of poultry in France has long been recognized, 
being due mainly to the prevalence of moderately small holdings 
and the national disposition to small rural industries. The eggs 
exported are collected from the farmers by such a well-organized 
system that eggs collected on Wednesday are in the London market 
the following Tuesday. The home consumption of eggs is also 
enormous, so that when prices for foreign eggs decreased in England, 
the Paris market paid better. In 1900 the Paris Municipal Council 
reported the consumption of eggs in that city alone in the previous 
year as 212 per head. Eggs are imported from Italy to some extent. 

The conditions in Belgium are somewhat similar to those in France. 
Some eggs are imported from Italy, and much of the home production 
is from imported Italian hens, kept laying for a Year and then killed : 
eggs are exported chiefly to France, Great Britain and Germany. 
There is a fattening industry somewhat similar to that in Sussex, 
lean chickens being bought for fattening in certain markets. The 
chief export of these is to Germany, but there is some to the London 
market, especially in December. 

In the Netherlands the number of poultry increased consider- 
ably during the last decade of the 19th century, excepting turkeys, 
which diminished. Taking 1900 as a typical year, there were 
4,083,312 fowls, 430,022 ducks, 36,307 geese, and 13,130 turkeys; 
and there were about 70 special establishments for poultry-rearing, 
which were rather on the increase, chiefly for local requirements. 
Of eggs there were exported to Belgium 656,898, England 370,418 
and Germany 3/212,845 kilos; but the imports were in excess of this 
by 2,916,269 kilos, and came chiefly from Russia. Dead fowls and 
ducks also go to the countries above named. 

In Denmark there were in 1900 about 9,000,000 fowls, mostly^ local 
and Italian. The eggs exported numbered 332,000,000, practically 
all to England; there were imported 35,600,000, practically all 
Russian, re-exported to England. The flourishing export trade is 
due to a good co-operative system. 

Germany is a large consumer rather than a producer of poultry 
products, and chiefly a carrier of her nominal exports. She imports 
eggs from Italy and Austria-Hungary as well as from Russia. 

Austria-Hungary has a large trade in poultry and eggs. In 1900 
the dual monarchy imported poultry to the value of £268,240 
and eggs to the value of £1,230,655. But the exports of poultry 
amounted to £977,051, and of eggs to no less than £3,750.°78. 
This country is therefore a very large producer, most of the eggs 
going to Germany, and some of them through her on to England. 

Italy sends live fowls, for laying, to northern Europe, and eggs 
to Belgium and France. 

In Russia the growth of the poultry industry has been very great 
since 1890. In that year her British trade was small: in 1900 she 
bulked largest of all countries in eggs sent to England direct, and 
some nominally from others really came from her. Her exports of 
eggs (reckoned as £1 = 10 roubles) were valued in 1898 at £3,113,386, 
and of live poultry (chiefly geese) at £637,000; but this latter sum is 
now exceeded by geese alone sent to Germany, as above noticed. 



POUNCE— POUND 



Her vast southern provinces are, of course, the origin of this produce, 
which is collected by dealers from the farmers, the price realized 
by the latter for eggs being in summer sometimes less than a rouble 
per hundred. The government has shown considerable interest 
in this growing industry in several ways, and produce is carried at 
almost incredibly low rates on the State railways; but the vast 
distances involved must always confine Russian produce to the 
supply of the cheaper class of demand in western Europe. (L. Wr.) 

POUNCE, (i) To drop upon and seize: properly said of a 
bird of prey seizing its victim in its claws. The substantive 
" pounce," from which the verb is formed, was the technical 
name in falconry for the claws on the three front toes of a hawk's 
claws, and so The Book of St Albans (i486) " Fryst the grete 
Clees behynde ... ye shall call hom talons. ... The Clees 
within the [fote ye shall call of right her Pownces." (2) To 
decorate metal by driving or punching a design into it from the 
under or back part of the surface; also to decorate cloth or other 
fabrics by punching or " pinking " holes, scalloping the edges, 
&c. Both these words seem to be variants of " punch*" (q.v.) 9 
which comes ultimately from the Latin pnngere, pttnetum, to 
prick, pierce. From them must be distinguished (3) " pounce, " 
a preparation of powdered cuttle-fish or sandarach, the resin 
of the sandarach-tree, formerly used for drying ink on the 
roughened surface of vellum, parchment or paper where an 
erasure had been made; later, the word was also given to the 
black sand used generally as a dusting-powder for drying ink 
before the invention of blotting-paper. The " pounce-box " 
or " pouncet-box " was a familiar object on all writing-tables 
till that time. A similar box with pierced lid for holding 
perfumes or aromatic vinegar also bore the name. This word is 
formed from the Lat. pttrnex, pumice-stpne, which was employed 
for securing a smooth surface on vellum, parchment, &c. The 
term " pounce " is also applied to a finely powdered gum of the 
juniper or to pipe-clay darkened with charcoal used in trans- 
ferring designs to fabrics, wall-surfaces, &c, through holes 
pricked in the original drawing. 

POUND. 1 (1) An enclosure in which cattle or other animals are 
retained until redeemed by the owners, or when taken in distraint 
until replevised, such retention being in^the nature of a pledge 
or security to compel satisfaction for debt or damage done. 
Animals may be seized and impounded when (1) distrained for 
rent; (2) damage feasant, i.e. doing harm on the land of the person 
seizing; (3) straying; (4) taken under legal process*. A pound 
belongs to the township or village or manor where it is situated. 
The pound-keeper is obliged to receive everything offered to his 
custody and is not answerable if the thing offered be illegally 
impounded. 

By a statute of 1554, no distress of cattle can be driven out 
of the hundred where taken unless to a pound in the same county, 
within three miles of the place of seizure. This statute also 
fixes^ 4d. as the fee for impounding a distress. Where cattle 
are impounded the impounder is bound to supply them with 
sufficient food and water (Cruelty to Animals Acts 1849 and 1854); 
any person,^ moreover, is authorized to enter a place where 
animals are impounded without food and water more than twelve 
hours and supply them; and the cost of such food is to be paid 
by the owner of the animal before it is removed. A statute 
of 1690 gives treble damages and costs against persons guilty 
of pound breach; and by statute of 1843 (Pound Breach) persons 
releasing or attempting to release cattle impounded or damaging 
any pound are liable to a fine not exceeding £5, awardable to 
the person on whose behalf the cattle were distrained, with 
imprisonment with hard labour in default. In the old law books 

> Pound, in sense (1), is represented late in O.E. by the compounds 
pund-fotd and pund-breche and by the derivative pyndon, to dam up 
enclose, and for-pyndan, to shut out. The origin is unknown- 

pen, an enclosure, is from a different root; " pond M a small pool 
of water, is a Middle English variant of " pound." In sense <>) 
the O.E. and M.E. pund, Du. pond, Ger. Pfund, are derivatives 
°. ! th . e Lat. indeclinable substantive pondo— really an ablative 
singular as if from pondus (2nd declension)— a variant of pondus, 
Ppndens, weight, the Lat. pondo is used as a shortened form of 
libra pondo, pound by weight. Finally is the verb " to pound," 
to crush by beating, to strike or beat; this in O.E. is punian, the d 
being excrescent as in " sound," noise. The word is rare outside 
English; cf. Mod. Du. pum, rubbish, broken stone. 



221 

varieties of pounds— as a common pound, an open pound and 
a close pound— are enumerated. By the Distress for Rent Act 
1737 any person distraining for rent may turn any part of the 
premises into a pound pro hac vice for securing the distress. 
Pounds are not now much used. (F. Wa.) 

Pound (2)— (a) a measure of weight; (b) an English money 
of account, (a) The English standard unit of weight is the 
avoirdupois pound of 7000 grains. The earliest weight in the 
English system was the Saxon pound, subsequently known as 
the Tower pound, from the old mint pound kept in the Tower 
of London. The Tower pound weighed 5400 grains and this 
weight of silver was coined into 240 pence or 20 shillings, hence 
pound in sense (2) (a pound weight of silver). The pound troy, 
probably introduced from France, was in use as early as 141 5 
and was adopted as the legal standard for gold and silver in 
1527. The act which abolished the Tower pound (18 Hen. VIII.: 
the " pounde Troye which exceedeth the pounde Tower in weight 
iii quarters of the 02.") substituted a pound of 5760 grains, at 
which the pound troy still remains. There was in use together 
with the pound troy, the merchant's pound, weighing 6750 
grains, which was estabtished about 1270 for all commodities 
except gold, silver and medicines, but it was generally superseded 
by the pound avoirdupois about 1330. There was also in use 
for a short time another merchant's pound, introduced from 
France and Germany; this pound weighed 7200 grains. The 
pound avoirdupois has remained in use continuously since the 
14th century, although it may have varied slightly at different 
periods — the Elizabethan standard was probably 7002 grains. 
The standard pound troy, placed together with the standard 
yard in the custody of the clerk of the House of Commons 
by a resolution of the House of the 2nd of June 1758, 
was destroyed at the burning of the houses of parliament 
in 1834. In 1838 a commission was appointed to consider 
the^ restoration of the standards, and in consequence of 
their report in 1841 the pound avoirdupois of 7000 grains 
was substituted for the pound troy as the standard. A new 
standard pound avoirdupois was made under the direction 
of a committee appointed in 1834 (which reported in 1854), by 
comparison with authenticated copies of the original standard 
(see Phil. Trans. 1856). This standard pound was legalized 
by an act of 1855 (18 & 19 Vict. c. 72). The standard avoirdu- 
pois pound is made of platinum, in the form of a cylinder nearly 
i*3S in. high and 1-15 in. in diameter. It has a groove or channel 
round it to enable it to be lifted by means of an ivory fork 
(for illustration see Weights and Measures) and is marked 
" P.S. 1844. ilb." P.S. meaning Parliamentary Standard. It is 
preserved at the Standards Office, in the custody of the Board 
of Trade. Copies were also deposited at the Houses of Parlia- 
ment, the Royal Mint, the Royal Observatory and with the 
Royal Society. 

See the Reports of the Standards Commission (6 parts, 1868-1873), 
especially 3rd report (on the abolition of troy weight) and 5th 
report (on the business of the Standards Dept. and the condition 
of the official standards and apparatus; description of the reveri- 
fication of the various official standards, with diagrams), 

(b) The English monetary unit is the pound; it was originally 
a pound weight of silver (hence written £ for libra, Lat. pound 
weight), coined into twenty shillings, and is now represented 
by the gold sovereign (q.v.). The pound Scots was at one time 
of the same value as the English pound, but through gradual 
debasement of the coinage was reduced at the accession of 
James I. to about one-twelfth of the value of tbe English pound, 
and was divided into twenty shillings, each about the value of 
an English penny. The Egyptian pound, written £E, is a gold 
coin of 100 piastres, and was made the monetary unit of the 
country by a decree of the 14th of November 1885. Its weight 
is 8-544 grammes of gold 0-875 fine and its value in English 
standard gold is £1, os. 6}d. The Turkish pound is written 
£T. The Turkish monetary system is dealt with at length under 
Turkey: Monetary System. 

Valuable information from the historical point of view will be 
found in the Reports of the Standards Commission quoted above, 
and in H. \V\ Chisholm's On the Science of Weighing and Measuring 
(1877) and his Seventh Annual Report as warden of the standards;

POUSSIN— POVOA DE VARZIM 



R. Ruding, Annals of the Coinage (1819) and H. J. Chaney, Our 
Weights and Measures (1897). (T. A. I.) 

POUSSIN, NICOLAS (1594-1665), French painter, was born 
at Les Andelys (Eure) in June 1594. Early sketches attracted 
the notice of Quentin Varin, a local painter, whose pupil Poussin 
became, till he went to Paris, where he entered the studio of 
Ferdinand Elle, a Fleming, and then of the Lorrainer L'Alle- 
mand. He found French art in a stage of transition: the old 
apprenticeship system was disturbed, and the academical schools 
destined to supplant it were not yet established; but, having 
met Courtois the mathematician, Poussin was fired by the study 
of his collection of engravings after Italian masters. After two 
abortive attempts to reach Rome, he fell in with the chevalier 
Marini at Lyons. Marini employed him on illustrations to his 
poems, took him into his household, and in 1624 enabled Poussin 
(who had been detained by commissions in Lyons and Paris) 
to rejoin him at Rome. There, his patron having died, Poussin 
fell into great distress. Falling ill he was received into the house 
of his compatriot Dughet and nursed by his daughter Anna Maria 
to whom in 1629, Poussin was married. Among his first patrons 
were Cardinal Barberini, for whom was painted the " Death 
of Germamcus " (Barberini Palace) ; Cardinal Omodei, for whom 
he produced, in 1630, the "Triumphs of Flora" (Louvre); 
Cardinal de Richelieu, who commissioned a Bacchanal (Louvre) ; 
Vicenzo Giustiniani, for whom was executed the " Massacre 
of the Innocents," of which there is a first sketch in the British 
Museum; Cassiano dal Pozzo, who became the owner of the first 
series of the " Seven Sacraments " (Belvoir Castle); and Fieart 
de Chanteloup, with whom in 1640 Poussin, at the call of Sublet 
de Noyers, returned to France. Louis XIII. conferred on him 
the title of " first painter in ordinary," and in two years at Paris 
he produced several pictures for the royal chapels (the " Last 
Supper," painted for Versailles, now in the Louvre) and eight 
cartoons for the Gobelins, the series of the " Labours of Hercules " 
for the Louvre, the " Triumph of Truth " for Cardinal Richelieu 
(Louvre), and much minor work. In 1643, disgusted by the 
intrigues of Simon Vouet, Feuquieres and the architect Lemercier, 
Poussin withdrew to Rome. There, in 1648, he finished for 
De Chanteloup the second series of the " Seven Sacraments " 
(Bridge water Gallery), and also his noble landscape with Diogenes 
throwing away his Scoop (Louvre); in 1649 he painted the 
" Vision of St Paul " (Louvre) for the comic poet Scarron, and 
in ^651 the " Holy Family " (Louvre) for the duke of Crequi. 
Year by year he continued to produce an enormous variety of 
works, many of which are included in the list given by 
Felibien. He died on the 19th of November 1665 and was 
buried in the church of St Lawrence in Lucina, his wife 
having predeceased him. 

The finest collection of Poussin' s paintings as well as of his 
drawings is possessed by the Louvre; but, besides the pictures in 
the National Gallery and at Dulwich, England possesses several of 
his most considerable works: The " Triumph of Pan " is at Baisildon 
(Berkshire), and his great allegorical painting of the " Arts " at 
Knowsley. At Rome, in the Colonna and Valentini Palaces, are nota- 
ble works by him, and one of the private apartments of Prince Doria 
is decorated by a great series of landscapes in distemper. Through- 
out his life he stood aloof from the popular movement of his native 
school. French art in his day was purely decorative, but in Poussin 
we find a survival of the impulses of the Renaissance coupled with 
conscious reference to classic work as the standard of excellence. 
In general we see his paintings at a great disadvantage, for the 
colour, even of the best preserved, has changed in parts, so that 
the keeping is disturbed; and the noble construction of his designs 
can be better seen in engravings than in the original. Amongst 
the many who have reproduced his works Audran, Claudine Stella, 
Picart and Pesne are the most successful. 

Poussin left no children, but he adopted as his son Gaspar 
Dughet (Gasparo Duche), his wife's brother, who took the name 
of Poussin. Gaspar Poussin (1 613-1675) devoted himself to 
landscape painting and rendered admirably the severer beauties of 
the Roman Campagna; a noteworthy senes of works in tempera 
representing various sites near Rome is to be seen in the Colonna 
Palace; but one of his finest easel-pictures, the " Sacrifice of Abra- 
ham," formerly the property of the Colonna, is now, with other works 
by the same painter, in the National Gallery, London.^ The frescoes 
executed by Gaspar Poussin in S. Martino di Monti are in a bad 
state of preservation. The Louvre does not possess a single work 
by his hand. Gaspar died at Rome on the 27th of May 1675.

POUT, also whiting-pout or bib (Gadus luscus), a fish of the 
family Gadidae. It is a small species abundant on the coasts 
of northern and western Europe, but less so in the Mediterranean. 
It is distinguished from other species of the genus Gadus by 
having a deep short body, with more or less distinct dark bars; 
a short and obtuse snout, not longer than the eye; the upper jaw 
the longer; and a long barbel at the chin. A black spot occupies 
the upper part of the base of the pectoral fin. Pout affect certain 
localities of limited extent, where a number may be caught with 
hook and line. They are excellent food, but must be eaten 
soon after capture. A pout of 5 lb is considered a very large 
specimen. 

POUVILLON, 6MILE (1840-1906), French novelist, was born 
at Montauban (Tarn et Garonne). He published in 1878 a 
collection of stories entitled Nouvelles rialistes. Making himself 
the chronicler of his native province of Quercy, he painted its 
scenery and its life with great clearness of outline and without 
exaggeration. His books include Cisette (1881), the story of 
a peasant girl; U Innocent (1884); J ean-de- Jeanne (1886); Le 
Cheval bleu (1888); Le Vceu d'Ure chaste (1900); Chante-pleure 
(1890); Les Antibcl (189a); P elites dmes (1893); Mademoiselle 
CUmence (1896); Pays et paysages (1895); P elites gens (1905); 
Bernadette de Lonrdes (1894), a mystery; and Le Roi de Rome 
(1898), a play. He died at Chambery. 

POVINDAH, a class of warrior nomadic traders in Afghanistan, 
who belong chiefly to the Nasir and Suliman Kuel tribes of 
Ghilzais. Their name, which designates their occupation, is 
derived from the same root as the Pushtu word for " to graze." 
They are almost wholly engaged in the carrying trade between 
India and Afghanistan and Central Asia. They assemble every 
autumn in the plains east of Ghazni, with their families, flocks, 
herds and long strings of camels and horses, laden with the goods 
of Bokhara and Kandahar; and forming caravans march through 
the Kakar and Waziri countries by the Zhob and Gomal passes 
of the Suliman hills. Entering Dera Ismail Khan district about 
October they leave their families and flocks, their arms and some 
two-thirds .of their fighting men in the great grazing grounds 
which he on either side of the Indus, and while some wander 
in search of employment, others pass on with their merchandise 
to the great cities of India, and even by rail as far as Calcutta, 
Karachi and Bombay. In the spring they again assemble, and 
return by the same route to their homes in the hills about Ghazni 
and Kalat-i-Ghilzai. When the hot season begins, the men, 
leaving their belongings behind them, move off again to 
Kandahar, Herat and Bokhara, with the Indian and European 
merchandise which they have brought from Hindustan. For 
generations the Waziris have carried on war to the knife with 
these merchant traders. To meet the opposition that awaited 
them on the road the Povindahs used to move heavily armed, 
in bodies of from 5000 to 10,000, and regular marches and en- 
campments were observed under an elected khan or leader. 
But since the Gomal Pass was taken over by the British and 
opened up in 1889 there has been comparative security on the 
border. During the Second Afghan War the tribes on the Tank 
border were stirred up by emissaries from Kabul, and the Suliman 
Khel joined the Mahsud Waziris in their daring raid on the town 
of Tank in January 1879. Colonel Boisragon, who commanded 
at Dera Ismail Khan, moved out against the Povindah settle- 
ments in the mouth of the Gomal Pass and severely punished 
them. The Povindahs paid a fine of nearly Rs. 60,000 (£6000), 
and agreed that in future their migratory bands should be dis- 
armed on their entry into British territory, their weapons to 
be deposited in a military arsenal, and returned to their owners 
when they again crossed the border.

frequented sea-bathing resort in northern Portugal; it is also the 
headquarters of important sardine, hake, and sea-bream fisheries. 

POWDER (through 0. Fr. puldre, modern poudre, from Lat. 
pulvis, pulveris, dust), the small loose particles into which 
solid matter is disintegrated by such processes as grinding, 
crushing, pounding, &c, hence any preparation which takes the 
form of such loose uncompacted particles, the most familiar 
example of such preparation being that of gunpowder (q.v.). 
Many powders are found in medical uses, some of which have 
retained the name of their inventor, such as the compound 
powder of rhubarb, " Gregory powder," named after a Scottish 
doctor, James Gregory (1 758-1822). Various preparations in 
form of powder are used for toilet purposes. During the period 
when the hair or wig was worn " powdered " or whitened, 
houses had a special room set apart for the process, known as 
the powdering-room or closet. In some birds, such as the herons, 
certain down-feathers or plumulae break off into a fine dust as 
fast as they are formed and form tracts defined in size and situa- 
tion and known as " powder-down patches." 

POWELL, FREDERICK YORK (1850-1904), English his- 
torian and scholar, was born in Bloomsbury, London, on the 14th 
of January 1850. Much of his childhood was spent in France 
and Spain, so that he early acquired a mastery of the language 
of both countries and an insight into the genius of the people; 
He was educated at Rugby School, and matriculated at Oxford 
as an unattached student, subsequently joining Christ Church, 
where he took a first-class in law and modern history in 1872. 
He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1874, and 
married in the same year. He became law-lecturer and tutor of 
Christ Church, fellow of Oriel College, delegate of the Clarendon 
Press, and in 1894 he was made regius professor of modern 
history in succession to J. A. Froude. Although he never made 
any extensive contribution to history, he was a particularly 
stimulating teacher. He had been attracted in his school days 
to the study of Scandinavian history and literature, and he was 
closely allied with Professor Gudbrandr Vigf usson (d. 1 889) , whom 
he assisted in his Icelandic Prose Reader (1897), Corpus poeticum 
boreale (1887), Origines tslandicae (1905), and in the editing of 
the Grimm Centenary papers (1886). He took a keen interest 
in the development of modern French poetry, and Verlaine, 
Mailarme* and Verhaeren all lectured at Oxford under his 
auspices. He was also a connoisseur in Japanese art. In politics 
his sympathies were with the oppressed of all nationalities; 
he had befriended refugees after the Commune, counting among 
his friends Jules Valles 1 the author of Les Rifractaires\ and 
he was also a friend of Stepniak and his circle. He died at 
Oxford on the 8th of May 1904. 

See the Life, with letters and selections, by Oliver Elton (1906). 

POWELL, GEORGE (c. 1658-1714), English actor and 
playwright, was the son of an actor of the same name (d. c. 
1698), with whom, as the king of Bakam, he first appeared in 
1687, as Emanuel in The Island Princess t Tate's version of 
Fletcher's play. He wrote or adapted Alphonso, King of 
Naples (1661), Treacherous Brothers (1676), and Very Good Wife 
(1693), and acted in' them and in a long list of contemporary 
plays almost until his death. As a tragedian he succeeded to 
many of Betterton's parts, but not to his genius. 

POWELL, JOHN WESLEY (1834-1902), American geologist 
and ethnologist, was born at Mount Morris, New York, 
on the 24th of March 1834. His parents were of English 
birth, but had moved to America in 1830, and he was 
educated at Illinois and Oberlin colleges. When the Civil 
War broke out he entered the Union Army as a private, 
and at the battle of Shiloh he lost his right arm. He 
continued, however, on active service and served as division 
chief of artillery before Vicksburg, reaching the rank 
of major of volunteers. In 1865 he was appointed professor 
of geology and curator of the museum in the Illinois Wesleyan 
University at Bloomington, and afterwards at the Normal 
University. In 1867 he commenced a series of expeditions to 

1 (1833-1885), member of the Commune of 1871. 



the Rocky Mountains and the canyons of the Green and Colorado 
rivers, during the course of which (1869) he made a daring boat- 
journey of three months, through the Grand Canyon, the river 
channel not having previously been explored. In these travels 
he gathered much valuable information on the geology, and he 
also made a special study of the Indians and their languages. 
His able work led to the establishment under the U.S. government 
of the geographical and geological survey of the Rocky Mountain 
region with which he was occupied in 1870-1879. This survey, 
with those of Ferdinand Hayden (1 820-1887) and Captain 
George M. Wheeler (b. 1842) was incorporated with the United 
States Geological and Geographical Survey under Clarence King 
(184 2-1 901) in 1879, when Powell became director of the 
Bureau of Ethnology, a department he had assisted in founding. 
On King's resignation in 1881, Powell was appointed director also 
of the Geological Survey, a post which he occupied until 1894. 
To him the present thorough organization of the U.S. Geological 
Survey is largely due. 

His principal publications were Exploration of the Colorado 
River of the West and its Tributaries (1875), Report on the Geology 
of the Eastern Portion of the Uinta Mountains (1876), Report on 
the Lands of the A ridRegion of the United States (1879) , Introduction 
to the Study of Indian Languages (1880), Canyons of the Colorado 
(1895), Truth and Error (1898). Especially important were his 
observations on what is now termed the " Uinta type " of 
mountain structure: a broad, flattened anticline, from which the 
strata descend steeply into bordering low grounds and quickly 
resume their horizontality — being sometimes faulted, and 
affording evidence of enormous denudation. He died in Haven, 
Maine, on the 23rd of September 1902.

POWELL, VAVASOR (1617-1670), Welsh Nonconformist, 
was by birth a Radnorshire man and was educated at Jesus 
College, Oxford. About 1639 he entered upon the career of an 
itinerant preacher, and for preaching in various parts of Wales 
he was twice arrested in 1640; however, he was not punished and 
during the Civil War he preached in and around London. In 
1646, when the victory of the parliamentary cause was assured, 
Powell returned to Wales, having received a certificate of cha- 
racter from the Westminster Assembly, although he had refused 
to be ordained by the Presbyterians. With a salary granted to 
him by parliament he resumed his itinerant preaching in Wales. 
In 1650 parliament appointed a commission " for the better 
propagation and preaching of the gospel in Wales," and Powell 
acted as one of the principal advisers «f this body. For three 
years he was actively employed in removing from their parishes 
those ministers whom he regarded as incompetent. In 1653 he 
returned to London, and having denounced Cromwell for accept- 
ing the office of Lord Protector he was imprisoned. At the 
Restoration in 1660 he was arrested for preaching, and after a 
short period of freedom he was again seized, and he remained in 
prison for seven years. He was set free in 1667, but in the 
following year he was again a prisoner, and he was in custody 
when he died on the 27th of October 1670. Powell wrote several 
treatises and also some hymns, but his chief gifts were those of 
a preacher.

POWER [WILLIAM GRATTAN] TYRONE (1797-1841), 
Irish actor, was born near Kilmacthomas on the 2nd of Novem- 
ber 1797. At the age of fourteen he joined a company of strolling 
players, eventually getting small parts in the London theatres. 
On the sudden death of Charles Connor he was given his parts 
and was immediately recognized as the best stage Irishman of his

performed several Irish plays, and published three novels and 
his Impressions of America (1836). He had married when 
twenty and left a widow and seven children, the oldest of whom, 
Sir William Tyrone Power, K.C.B. (b. 1819), became Commis- 
sary-general of the British army and was knighted in 1865. 

POWER OF ATTORNEY, or Letter of Attorney, is an 
authority under hand and seal empowering the person named 
therein to do some act on behalf of the principal, which other- 
wise could only be done by the principal himself. It is either 
general or special. A general power of attorney authorizes 
the agent to act for his principal in all matters, or in matters of a 
particular nature only, or in respect of a particular business. 
A special act of attorney authorizes the agent to represent his 
principal only in some particular specified act. It expires with 
death of the principal, and is revocable at his will, even by a 
verbal notice, unless it has been given for a valuable considera- 
tion. Moreover, the terms of the power are construed literally, 
and give such authority only as they confer expressly or by 
necessary implication. The Conveyancing Act of 1881 provides 
protection for any person making any payment or doing any 
act in good faith, in pursuance of a power of attorney, if before 
the time of the payment or act the donor of the power had 
died or become lunatic, of unsound mind, or bankrupt, or had 
revoked the power. The law relating to powers of attorney 
is a branch of the law of agency. (See Agent; Principal and 
Agent.) 

POWERS, HIRAM (1805-1873), American sculptor, the son 
of a farmer, was born at Woodstock, Vermont, on the 29th of 
June 1805. In 181 9 his father removed to Ohio, about six 
miles from Cincinnati, where the son attended school for about 
a year, staying meanwhile with his brother, a lawyer in Cincinnati. 
After leaving school he found employment in superintending a 
reading-room in connexion with the chief hotel of the town, 
but, being, in his own words, " forced at last to leave that place 
as his clothes and shoes were fast leaving him," he became a 
clerk in a general store. His second employer in this line of 
business having invested his capital in a clock and organ factory, 
Powers set himself to master the construction of the instruments, 
displaying an aptitude which in a short time enabled him to 
become the first mechanic in the factory. In 1826 he began to 
frequent the studio of Mr Eckstein, and at once conceived a 
strong passion for the art of sculpture. His proficiency in 
modelling secured him the situation of general assistant and 
artist of the Western Museum, kept by a Frenchman named 
Dorfeuille, where his ingenious representation of the infernal 
regions to illustrate the more striking scenes in the poem of 
Dante met with extraordinary success. After studying 
thoroughly the art of modelling and casting, at the end of 
1834 he went to Washington, where his remarkable gifts soon 
awakened general attention. In 1837 he settled in Florence, 
where he remained till his death. While he found it profitable 
to" devote the greater part of his time to busts, his best efforts 
were bestowed on ideal work. In 1839 his statue of " Eve " 
excited the warm admiration of Thorwaldsen, and in 1843 he 
produced his celebrated " Greek Slave," which at once gave 
him a place among the leading sculptors of his time. Among 
the best known of his other ideal statues are the " Fisher 
Boy," " II Penseroso," " Proserpine," " California," " America " 
(modelled for the Crystal Palace, Sydenham), and the "Last 
of his Tribe." He died on the 27th of June 1873.

POWER TRANSMISSION. The appliances connected with 
installations for the utilization of natural sources of energy may 
be classified into three groups: — 

1. Prime movers, by means of which the natural form of 
energy is transformed into mechanical energy. To this group 
belong all such appliances as water turbines, steam turbines, 
steam engines and boilers, gas producers, gas engines, oil engines, 
&c. ^ * 

2. Machinery of any kind which is driven by energy made 
available by the prime mover. To this group belong all machine 



tools, textile machinery, pumping machinery, cranes — in fact 
every kind of machine which requires any considerable quantity 
of energy to drive it. 

3. The appliances by means of which the energy made avail- 
able by the prime mover is transmitted to the machine designed 
to utilise it. The term power is used to denote the rate at which 
energy is transmitted. The unit of power in common use is 
the horse power, and one horse power means a rate of transmis- 
sion of 550 foot-pounds per second. 

In many cases the prime mover is combined with the machine 
in such a way that the transmitting mechanism is not distinctly 
differentiated from either the prime mover or the machine, as 
in the case of the locomotive engine. In other cases the energy 
made available by the prime mover is distributed to a number 
of separate machines at a distance from the prime mover, as 
in the case of an engineer's workshop. In this case the trans- 
mitting mechanism by means of which the energy is distributed 
to the several machines has a distinct individuality. In other 
cases prime movers are located in places where the natural 
source of energy is abundant, namely, near waterfalls, or in the 
neighbourhood of coal-fields, and the energy made available 
is transmitted in bulk to factories, &c, at relatively great dis- 
tances. In this case the method and mechanism of distribution 
become of paramount importance, since the distance between 
the prime mover and the places where the energy is to be 
utilized by machines is only limited by the efficiency of the 
mechanism of distribution. 

Prime movers are considered in the articles Steam Engine; 
Gas Engine; Oil Engine, and Hydraulics, and machines in 
various special articles. The methods and mechanisms of 
distribution or transmission alone form the subjects of the 
present article, and the different methods in general use readily 
fall into four divisions: — 

1 . M echanical. 3 . Pneumatic. 

2. Hydraulic. 4. Electrical. 

I. — Mechanical 

§ 1. Methods, — The mechanical transmission of power is 
effected in general by means of belts or ropes, by shafts or by 
wheel gearing and chains. Each individual method may be 
used separately or in combination. The problems involved in the 
design and arrangement of the mechanisms for the mechanical 
distribution of power are conveniently approached by the con- 
sideration of the way in which the mechanical energy made avail- 
able by an engine is distributed to the several machines in the 
factory. By a belt on the fly-wheel of the prime mover the 
power is transmitted to the line shaft, and pulleys suitably placed 
along the line shaft by means of other belts transmit power, 
first, to small countershafts carrying fast and loose pulleys and 
striking gear for starting or stopping each engine at will, and 
then to the driving pulleys of the several machines. (See also 
Pulleys.) 

§ 2. Quantitative Estimation of the Power Transmitted. — In 
dealing with the matter quantitatively the engine crank-shaft 
may be taken as the starting point of the transmission, and the 
first motion-shaft of the machine as the end of the transmission 
so far as that particular machine is concerned. 

Let T be the mean torque or turning effort which the engine 
exerts continuously on the crank shaft when it is making N revolu- 
tions per second. It is more convenient to express the revolutions 
per second in terms of the angular velocity «, that is, in radians 
per second. The relation between these quantities is w = 27rN. 
Then the rate at which work is done by the engine crank shaft is 
Tw foot-pounds per second, equivalent to Tw/550 horse power. 
This is now distributed to the several machines in varying proportions. 
Assuming for the sake of simplicity that the* whole of the power 
is absorbed by one machine, let Ti be the torque on the first motion- 
shaft of the machine, and let a>i be its angular velocity, then the 
rate at which the machine is absorbing energy is Tia>i foot-pounds 
per second. A certain quantity of energy is absorbed by the transmit- 
ting mechanism itself for the purpose of overcoming frictional 
and other resistances, otherwise the rate of absorption of energy 
by the machine would exactly equal the rate at which it was produced 
by the prime mover assuming steady conditions of working. Actually 
therefore Tion would be less than Tw so that 

Tjwi = 7jT«, (1)

where 17 is called the efficiency of the transmission. Considering 
now the general problem of a multiple machine transmission, ^ if 

Ti, wi,Tj, «2,T|, to* are the several torques and angular velocities 

of the respective first motion shafts of the machines, 

(T^+T^+Tjwa-I- ) =VTo> (2) 

expresses the relations which must exist at any instant of steady 
motion. This is not quite a complete statement of the actual 
conditions because some of the provided energy is always in course 
of being stored and unstored from instant to instant as kinetic 
energy in the moving parts of the mechanism. Here, 17 is the 
over-all efficiency of the distributing mechanism. We now consider 
the separate parts of the transmitting mechanism. 

§ 3. Belts. — Let a pulley A (fig. 1) drive a pulley B by means of a 
leather belt, and let the direction of motion be as indicated by the 
arrows on the pulleys. When the pulleys are revolving uniformly, A

Fig. 2. 



Fig. 1. 
transmitting power to B, one side of the belt will be tight and the 
other side will be slack, but both sides will be in a state of tension. 
Let / and u be the respective tensions on the tight and slack side ; 
then the torque exerted by the belt on the pulley B is (t — u)r f 
where r is the radius of the pulley in feet, and the rate at which the 
belt does work on the pulley is (t—u)rw foot-pounds per second. 
If the horse-power required to drive the machine be represented 
by h.p., then 

(/-tt)r« = 550h.p.,^ (3) 

assuming the efficiency of the transmission to be unity. This 
equation contains two unknown tensions, and before either can 
be found another condition is necessary. This is supplied by the 
relation between the tensions, the arc of contact 0, in radians (fig. 2), 
the coefficient of friction p, between the belt and the pulley, the 

mass of the belt and 
the speed of the belt. 
Consider an element of 
the belt (fig. 2) sub- 
tending an angle d$ at 
the centre of the pul- 
ley, and let / be the 
_ * tension on one side of 
-{t-TT } d *the element and (t+dt) 
the tension of the 
other side. The ten- 
sion tending to cause 
the ^ element to slide 
bodily round the sur- 
face of the pulley is dt. 
The normal pressure 
between the element 
and the face of the 
pulley due to the tensions is / d8, but this is diminished by the 
force necessary to constrain the element to move in the circular 
path determined by the curvature of the pulley. If W is the 
weight of the belt per foot, the constraining force required for 
this purpose is \Wdd/g, where v is the linear velocity of the belt 
in feet per second. Hence the frictional resistance of the element 
to sliding is (/ - WvVg)M<#, and this must be equal to the difference 
of tensions dt when the element is on the point of slipping, so 
that {t — X^v % lg)ndd = dt. The solution of this equation is 

where / is now the maximum tension and u the minimum tension, 
and e is the base of the Napierian system of logarithms, 2*718. 
Equations (3) and (4) supply the condition from which the power 
transmitted by a given belt at a given speed can be found. For 
ordinary work the term involving v may be neglected, so that (4) 
becomes 

//«-«*. (5) 

Equations (3) and (5) are ordinarily used for the preliminary design 
of a belt to calculate /, the maximum tension in the belt necessary 
to transmit a stated horse power at a stated speed, and then the 
cross section is proportioned so that the stress per square inch 
shall not exceed a certain safe limit determined from practice. 

To facilitate the calculations in connexion with equation (5), 
tables are . constructed giving the ratio //« for various values of m 
and $. (See W. C. Unwin. Machine Design, 12th ed., p. 377O The 
ratio should be calculated for the smaller pulley. If the belt is 
arranged as in fig. 1, that is, with the slack side uppermost, the drop 
of the belt tends to increase 9 and hence the ratio tju for both pulleys. 
xxii. 8 

\ 



§ 4. Example of Preliminary Design of a Belt, — The following 
example illustrates the use of the equations for the design of a belt 
in the ordinary way. Find the width of a belt to transmit 20 h.p. 
from the flywheel of an engine to a shaft which runs at 180 revolu- 
tions per miunte (equal to 18-84 radians per second), the pulley on 
the shaft being 3 ft. diameter. Assume the engine flywheel to be 
of such diameter and at such a distance from the driven pulley 
that the arc of contact is 120 , equal to 2-094 radians, and further 
assume that the coefficient of friction m~o-3. Then from 
equation (5) */w = £2-094X0.3 =2-7180.6282; that is log # //w =0-6282, 
from which //m = i-87, andu = //i-87. Using this in (3) we have 
/(1-1/1-87) 1-5 X 18-84 - 550 X 20, from which t = 838 lb. 
Allowing a working strength of 300 lb per square inch, the area 
required is 2-8 sq. in., so that if the belt is { in. thick its width 
would be 1 1 -2 in., or if --*, in. thick, 15 in. approximately. 

The effect of the force constraining the circular motion in diminish- 
ing the horse power transmitted may now be ascertained by calcu- 
lating the horse powei which a belt of the size found will actually 
transmit when the maximum tension / is 838 lb. A belt of the area 
found above would weigh about 1*4 lb. per foot. The velocity 
of the belt, u=«r = i8-84X 1-5 = 28-26 ft. per second. The term 
WvVg therefore has the numerical value 34-7. Hence equation (2) 
becomes (*— 34'7)/(w — 34*7) = 1-87, from which, inserting the 
value 838 for /, m = 464-5 lb. Using this value of u in equation (1) 
H p (8 3 8-464-5)Xi8-8 4 Xi-5 

Thus with the comparatively low belt speed of 28 ft. per second 
the horse power is only diminished by about 5%. As the velocity 
increases the transmitted horse power increases, but the loss from 
this cause rapidly increases, and there will be one speed for every 
belt at which the horse power transmitted is a maximum. An 
increase of speed above this results in a diminution of transmitted 
horse power. 

§ 5. Belt Velocity for Maximum Horse Power, — If the weight of a 
belt per foot is given, the speed at which the maximum horse power 
is transmitted for an assigned value of the maximum tension t can 
be calculated from equations (3) and^ (4) as follows: — 

Let / be the given maximum tension with which a belt weighing 
W lb per foot may be worked. Then solving equation (4) 
for m, subtracting t from each side, and changing the signs all 
through: / — u = (t— Wi^/g) (1— e~rf). And the rate of working 
U, in foot-pounds per second, is 

U= (t-~u)v = (to-Wf>V*)(i -<"*•). 
Differentiating U with regard to v, equating to zero, and solving for 
v t we have v = V 0g/3W). Utilizing the data of the previous example 
to illustrate this matter, £ = 838 lb per square inch, W = i*4 lb per 
foot, and consequently, from the above expression, » = 8o ft. per 
second approximately. A lower speed than this should be adopted, 
however, because the above investigation does not include the loss 
incurred by the continual bending of the belt round the circumference 
of the pulley. The loss from this cause increases with the velocity 
of the belt, and operates to make the velocity for maximum horse 
power considerably lower than that given above. 

§ 6. Flexibility. — When a belt or rope is working power is absorbed 
in its continual bending round the pulleys, the amount depending 
upon the flexibility of the belt and the speed. If C is the couple 
required to bend the belt to the radius of the pulley, the rate at which 
work is done is C« foot-pounds per second. The value of C for a 
given belt varies approximately inversely as the radius of the pulley, 
so that the loss of power from this cause will vary inversely as the 
radius of the pulley and directly as the speed of revolution. Hence 
thin flexible belts are to be preferred to thick stiff ones. Besides the 
loss of power in transmission due to this cause, the bending causes 
a stress in the belt which is to be added to the direct stress due to the 
tensions in the belt in order to find the maximum stress. In ordinary 
leather belts the bending stress is usually negligible; in ropes, how- 
ever, especially wire rope, it assumes paramount importance, since 
it tends to overstrain the outermost strands and if these give way 
the life of the rope is soon determined. 

§ 7. Rope' Driving. — About 1856 James Combe, of Belfast, 
introduced the practice of transmitting power by means of 
ropes running in grooves turned circumferentially in the rim of

the pulley (fig. 3). The ropes may be led off in groups to the 
different floors of the factory to pulleys keyed to the distributing 
shafting. A groove was adopted having an angle of about 45 ,

and this is the angle now used in the practice of Messrs 
Combe, Barbour and Combe, of Belfast. A section of the rim 
of a rope driving wheel showing the shape of the groove for a

ible than a belt, and 
therefore care must be 
taken not to arrange 
rope drives with pul- 
leys having too small 
a diameter relatively 
to the diameter of the 
rope. The principles 
of §§ 3, 4, S and 6, apply equally to ropes, but with the 
practical modification that the working stress in the rope is a 
much smaller fraction of the ultimate strength than in the

The speed originally adopted for the rope was 55 ft. per second. 
This speed has been exceeded, but, as indicated above, for any 
particular case there is one speed at which the maximum horse 
power is transmitted, and this speed is chosen with due regard 
to the effect of centrifugal tension and the loss due to the con- 
tinual bending of the rope round the pulley. Instead of using 
one rope for each groove, a single continuous rope may be used, 
driving from one common pulley several shafts at different 
speeds. For further information see Abram Combe, Proc. 
Inst. Mech. Eng. (July 1896). Experiments to compare the 
efficiencies of rope and belt driving were carried out at Lille 
in 1894 by the Sociiti Induslrielle du Nord de la France, for an 
account of which see D. S. Capper, Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng, 
(October 1896). Cotton ropes are used extensively for trans- 
mitting power in factories, and though more expensive than 
Manila ropes, are more durable when worked under suitable 
conditions. 

§ 8. Shafts. — When a shaft transmits power from a prime 
mover to a machine, every section of it 'sustains a turning couple 



or torque T, and if co is the angular velocity of rotation in radians 
per second, the rate of transmission is T w foot-pounds 
per second, and the relation between the horse power, torque 
and angular velocity is 

T« =550 H.P. (6) 

The problem involved in the design of a shaft is so to proportion 
the size that the stress produced by the torque shall not exceed 
a certain limit, or that the relative angular displacement of 
two sections at right angles to the axis of the shaft at a given 
distance apart shall not exceed a certain angle, the particular 
features of the problem determining which condition shall 
operate in fixing the size. At a section of a solid round shaft 
where the diameter is D inches, the torque T inch-pounds, and 
the maximum shearing stress / pounds per square inch, the 
relation between the quantities is given by 

T = /rD*//i6, (7) 

and the relation between the torque T, the diameter D, the 
relative angular displacement of two sections L inches apart by 
T = Oh-DV32L, (8) 

where C is the modulus of rigidity for the material of the 
shaft. Observe that 6 is here measured in radians. The 
ordinary problems of shaft transmission by solid round shafts 
subject to a uniform torque only can be solved by means of these 
equations. 

Calculate the horse power which a shaft 4 in. diameter can trans- 
mit, revolvingi20 times per minute (12*56 radians per second), 
when the maximum shearing stress / is limited to 11,000 lb 
per square inch. From equation (7) the maximum torque which 
may be applied to the shaft is T = 138,400 inch-pounds. From 

(6) H.P. = — 1 2Xqqo = 264. The example may be continued to 

find how much the shaft will twist in a length of 10 ft. Substituting 
the value of the torque in inch-pounds in equation (8), and taking 
11,500,000 for the value of C, 

a 138,400X120X3 2 ,. 

* = n,5oo,oooX3-i4X256 = '°57 radians > 

and this is equivalent to 3*3°. 

In the case of hollow round shafts where D is the external diameter 
and d the internal diameter equation (7) becomes 

T=*/(D<-<Z«)/i6D, (9) 

and equation (8) becomes 

T = C0ir(D 4 -d<)/32L. (10) 

The assumption tacitly made hitherto that the torque T 
remains constant is rarely true in practice; it usually varies from 
instant to instant, often in a periodic manner, and an appropriate 
value of / must be taken to suit any particular case. Again it 
rarely happens that a shaft sustains a torque only. There is 
usually a bending moment associated with it. For a discussion 
of the proper values of/, to suit cases where the stress is variable, 
and the way a bending moment of known amount may be 
combined with a known torque, see Strength of Materials. 
It is sufficient to state here that if M is the bending moment 
in inch-pounds, and T the torque in inch-pounds, the magnitude 
of the greatest direct stress in the shaft due to the effect of the 
torque and twisting moment acting together is the same as 
would be produced by the application of a torque of 

M+VCP+M 2 ) inch-pounds. (11) 

It will be readily understood that in designing a shaft for the 
distribution of power to a factory where power is taken off at 
different places along the shaft, the diameter of the shaft near 
the engine must be proportioned to transmit the total power 
transmitted whilst the parts of the shaft more remote from the 
engine are made smaller, since the power transmitted there is 
smaller. 

§ 9. Gearing Pitch Chains. — Gearing is used to transmit power 
from one shaft to another. The shafts may be parallel; or inclined 
to one another, so that if produced they would meet in a point ; or 
inclined to one another so that if produced they would not meet in 
a point. In the first case the gear wheels are called spur wheels, 
sometimes cog wheels; in the second case bevel wheels, or, if 
the angle between the shafts is oo°, mitre wheels; and in the third 
case they are called skew bevels. In all cases the teeth should 
be so shaped that the velocity ratio between the shafts remains 



HYDRAULIC] 



POWER TRANSMISSION 



227 



constant, although in very rare cases gearing is designed to 
work with a variable velocity ratio as part of some special 
machines. For the principles governing the shape of the teeth 
to fulfil the condition that the velocity ratio between the wheels 
shall be constant, see Mechanics, § Applied. The size of the 
teeth is determined by the torque the gearing is required to 
transmit. 

Pitch chains are closely allied to gearing; a familiar example 
is in the driving chain of a bicycle. Pitch chains are used to a 
limited extent as a substitute for belts, and the teeth of the chains 
and the teeth of the wheels with which they work are shaped 
on the same principles as those governing the design of the teeth 
of wheels. 

If a pair of wheels is required to transmit a certain maximum horse 
power, the angular velocity of the shaft being to, the pressure P 
which the teeth must be designed to sustain at the pitch circle is 
550 H.P./wR, where R is the radius of the pitch circle of the wheel, 
whose angular velocity is w. 

§ 10. Velocity Ratio. — In the case of transmission either by belts, 
ropes, shafts or gearing, the operating principle is that the rate of 
working is constant, assuming that the efficiency of the transmission 
is unity, and that the product Tw is therefore constant, whether the 
shafts are connected by ropes or gearing. Considering therefore 
two shafts^ Tiwi-Tjo??; that is wi/wj=»Tj/Ti; i.e. the angular 
velocity ratio is inversely as the torque ratio. Hence the higher 
the speed at which a shaft runs, the smaller the torque for the 
transmission of a given horse power, and the smaller the tension 
on the belts or ropes for the transmission of a given horse power. 

§11. Long Distance Transmission of Power. — C. F. Hirn origin- 
ated the transmission of power by means of wire ropes at Colmar 
in Alsace in 1850. Such a telodynamic transmission consists of 
a series of wire ropes running on wheels or pulleys supported 
on piers at spans varying from 300 to 500 ft. between the prime 
mover and the place where the power is utilized. > The slack 
of the ropes is supported in some cases on guide pulleys distri- 
buted between the main piers. In this way 300 h.p. was trans- 
mitted over a distance of 6500 ft. at Freiberg by means of a 
series of wire ropes running at 62 ft. per second on pulleys 
177 in. diameter. The individual ropes of the series, each 
transmitting 300 h.p., were each 1*08 in. diameter and contained 
10 strands of 9 wires per strand, the wires being each 0*072 in. 
diameter. Similar installations existed at SchafThausen, 
Oberursal, Bellegarde, Tortona and Zurich. For particulars 
of these transmissions with full details see \V. C. Unwin's 
Howard Lectures on the " Development and Transmission of 
Power from Central Stations " (Journ. Soc. Arls, 1893, published 
in book form 1894). The system of telodynamic transmission 
would no doubt have developed to a much greater extent than 
it has done but for the advent of electrical transmission, which 
made practicable the transmission of power to distances utterly 
beyond the possibilities of any mechanical system.

II.— Hydraulic 

The first proposal for a general transmission of hydraulic 
power was made by Bramah in 1802. In 1846 Lord Armstrong's 
hydraulic crane was erected at Newcastle, and was worked from 
the town water mains, but the pressure in such mains was too 
low and uncertain to secure satisfactory results. The invention 
of the accumulator in 1850 enabled much higher pressures to 
be used; since then 700 lb per square inch has been adopted in 
most private hydraulic power transmission plants. An attempt 
to give a public supply of hydraulic power was made in 1859, 
when a company was formed for laying mains in London along 
the river Thames between the Tower and Blackfriars, the 
engineer being Sir George Bruce; but though an act of parlia- 
ment was obtained, the works were not carried out. The first 
public hydraulic supply station was established at Hull in 1877. 
In 1883 the General Hydraulic Power Works, Messrs Ellington 
and Woodall being the engineers, were started in London, and 
they now form the largest system of hydraulic power transmission 
in existence. Works of a similar character have since been 
established in several other towns. The general features of 



hydraulic power transmissions are: (1) a central station where 
the hydraulic pressure is created, usually by means of steam 
pumping engines; (2) a system of distribution mains; (3) 
machines for utilizing the pressure. In cases of public supplies 
there is the further important matter of registration. 

When dealing with any practical problem of hydraulic power 
transmission it is of the first importance to determine the maxi- 
mum demand for power, its duration and frequency. 
If the duration of the maximum demand is limited s£*Jon. 
and the frequency restricted — for instance, when a 
swing bridge has to be opened and closed only a few times in 
the course of a day — a small pumping plant and a large 
accumulator will be desirable. If the maximum demand is 
more or less continuous, as when hydraulic pressure is used 
for working a pump in a mine or a hydraulic engine in a work- 
shop, the central station pumping engine must be capable of 
supplying the maximum demand without the aid of an 
accumulator, which may or may not, according to circum- 
stances, be provided to serve as a regulator. A hydraulic 
accumulator (fig. 1) ordinarily consists of a hydraulic cylinder 



11 




Fig. 1. 

and ram, the ram being loaded with sufficient weight to give the 
pressure required in the hydraulic mains. If a pressure of 700 lb 
per square inch is wanted, the weight of the ram and its load, 
neglecting friction, must be 700 lb for each square inch of its 
area, and if the cylinder is full, i.e. the ram elevated to its full 
•extent, the accumulator is a reservoir of power, exactly as if it 
w r ere a tank at the same cubical extent placed at an elevation 
of about 1600 ft. above the mains and connected with them. 
The function of accumulators in hydraulic power distribution 
is frequently misunderstood, and it has been urged that as in 
practice the size of the reservoirs of power that can be obtained 
by their use is small, they are of little value. An accumulator 
having a ram 20 in. diameter by 20 ft. stroke loaded to 700 lb is 



228 



POWER TRANSMISSION 



[HYDRAULIC 



a fairly large one, but it contains only 439,740 foot-pounds of 
available energy. If the accumulator ram descended in one 
minute the horse power developed during that time would be 
13-3, and until again pumped up its function would cease. Is so 
small a reservoir worth much? The correct answer to this 
question depends upon the surrounding circumstances. In the 
case of any general system of hydraulic power transmission it is 
certain that there will be very large and frequent variations 
in the combined demand for power, the periods of approximate 
maximum rarely exceeding in the aggregate 2 or 3 hours a day 
(see fig. 2). Where the area of supply is very extensive there 
are further subsidiary variations in small sections of the area. 
The main features of the combined load curves are fairly con- 
stant, but the local peaks are very erratic. Such conditions are 
favourable to the extensive use of accumulators. 

When comparing the economy of hydraulic machinery which 
works intermittently, such as cranes and hoists, with other 
systems the effect of the hydraulic accumulator in reducing the 
maximum horse power required is often neglected. In con- 
sequence the comparison is vitiated, because the minimum cost 
of running a central station depends to a great extent upon the 




Fig. 2. 
maximum demand, even though the maximum may be required 
only during a few minutes of the day. In the hydraulic system 
accumulators at the central stations perform t the two distinct 
functions of reducing the maximum load on the pumps which 
supply the demand, and regulating automatically the speed 
of the pumps as the demand varies from minute to minute. In 
any large system where a number of pumping units are required 
they also allow a sufficient interval of time to start any adoli- 
tional units. Accumulators connected to the mains at a con- 
siderable distance from the central station reduce the variations 



of pressure, and the size of mains required for a given supply 
of power, and therefore have a most important influence on the 
economy of distribution. The mechanical efficiency of hydraulic 
accumulators is very high, being from 95% to 98%, and they 
are practically indestructible. 

When designing central stations the aim should be to employ 
pumping engines of such capacity that they can be worked as 
nearly as possible continuously at about their maximum output; 
the same consideration should, in the main, determine the size 
of the pumping units in a station where more than a single unit 
is employed. With a number of units, each can be worked, 
when in use, at or near the most economical speed. Moreover, 
reserve plant is necessary if the supply of power is to be constant, 
and where the units are many the actual reserve required is 
less than where the units are few. 

An effect of the multiplication of power units is to increase 
the capital outlay; indeed, it may be stated quite generally that 
economy in working and maintenance cannot be obtained without a 
larger capital outlay than would be required for a simpler and less 
economical plant. A high degree of economy estimated on 
financial data — the ultimate base on which these practical questions 
rest — can only be obtained in large installations where the averaging 
effect of the combination of a large number of comparatively 
small intermittent demands for power is greatest. The term load- 
factor, since it was first coined by Colonel R. E. Crompton in 189 1, has 
come into common use as an expression of the relation between the 
average and the maximum output from any central source of supply. 
No argument is required to show that a given central station plant 
working continuously at its maximum speed day and night all the 
year round, say for 8760 hours in a year, should produce the power 
more cheaply per unit, not only as to the actual running cost, but also 
as to the capital or interest charges, than the same plant running 
on the average at the same speed for, say, one-third the time, or 
2920 hours. In this case the load-factor 2920/8760 = '333, or 
33*37° %• The saving on the whole expenditure per unit is not in 
direct proportion to an increase in the load-factor, and its effect on 
the various items of expenditure is extremely variable. The influence 
is greatest on the capital charges, and it has no influence at all, or 
may even have a detrimental effect, on some items; for instance, the 
cost of repairs per unit of output may be increased by a high load- 
factor. Its effect on the coal consumption depends very much on 
the kind and capacity of the boilers in use; on whether the engines 
are condensing or non-condensing; on the hours of work of the engine 
staff, &c. The economic value of the load-factor is of great import- 
ance in every installation^ but its influence on the cost of supply 
varies at each central station, and must be separately determined. 
There is a load-factor peculiar to each use for which the power is 
supplied, and the whole load-factor can only be improved by the 
combination of different classes of demands, which differ in regard 
to the time of day or season at which they attain their maximum. 
It is in this respect that the great economy of a public distribution 
of power is most apparent, though there is also, of course, a direct 
economy due simply to the presumably large size of the central 
stations of a public supply. Demands for power of every kind 
have unfortunately a tendency to arise at the same time, so that 
in the absence of storage of power there^ seems no prospect of the 
load-factors for general supply of power in towns exceeding, in the 
most favourable conditions, 40%. The load-factor of most 
public hydraulic power supplies is considerably under 30%. It is 
questionable, however, whether a very high load-factor conduces to 
economy of working expenses as a whole in any general supply of 
energy. The more continuous the supply during the twenty-four 
hours of the day the greater is the difficulty of executing repairs, 
and the greater the amount of the reserve plant required. 

In all central station work where fluctuating loads have to be 
dealt with it is most important that there should be ample boiler 
power. In a comprehensive system of power supply demand 
arises in a very sudden and erratic manner, and to meet this by 
forcing the boilers involves greater waste of coal than keeping 
steam up in sufficient reserve boilers. For this purpose boilers 
with large water capacity, such as the Lancashire, are preferable 
to the tubular type, if sufficient space is available. Superheated 
steam and also thermal storage are advantageous. Feed water 
heaters or economizers should always be used, all steam and feed 
pipes should be carefully protected from radiation, and the pipe 
flanges should be covered; in short, to secure^ good results in coal 
consumption every care must be taken to minimise the stand-by 
losses which are such serious items in central station economy 
when the load-factor is low. Though hydraulic power^ has the 
peculiar advantage, as regards coal consumption, that it is the 
speed of the engines which varies with an intermittent demand, 
nevertheless at the London stations it has been found that during 
a year's working only from 60 to 75 % of the coal efficiency of trial 
runs of the engines can be obtained — i.e. at least 25 % of the coal is 
wasted through the stand-by losses and through the pumping engines 
having to run at less than full power.

To determine the scale on which a central station plant should 
be designed is frequently a difficult matter. The rate of growth 
of the expected demand for the power is an important factor, but 
it has been clearly established that the reduction of working expenses 
resulting from the increase of size of an undertaking proceeds in a 
diminishing ratio. Increase in output is in fact sometimes accom- 
panied by more than a proportionate increase of expenses. During 
recent years there have been causes at work which have raised con- 
siderably the price of labour, fuel, other items of expense, and the 
law of the 4I diminishing ratio " has been masked. 

On the diagram (fig. 3) of the costs of the London undertaking 
and the amount of power supplied, have been plotted points marking 
the total expenses of each year in relation to the output of power. 
These points for the years 1884-1895, and for output of from 50 to 
700 million gallons followed approximately a straight line. Since 
1899, however, though the output has increased from 708 millions 
to 1040 million gallons, the costs per unit of output have been always 
considerably above the preceding periods. The details of the London 
supply given in table 1 partly explain this by the relatively^ high 
price of fuel, but an equally important factor has been the rise in 
the local rates, which in the period 1 899-1009 have risen from 2d. up 
to 3d. per 1000 gallons. If the cost of fuel, rates and wages had 
remained constant the plotting of expenses in relation to output 
would have been approximately along the extension of the line 
AB. This line cuts the vertical axis at A above the origin 0, and the 
line OA^ indicates the minimum amount of the expenses, and by 
implication the initial size of the first central station erected in 
London. The curve in this diagram gives the cost per 1000 gallons. 

Whether it is more economical to have several smaller stations 
in any particular system of power transmission, or a single centre of 
supply, is mainly governed by the cost of the mains and the facilities 
for laying 'them in the area served. No general rule can, however, 
be formulated, for it is a question of balance of advantages, and the

solution must be obtained by consideration of the special circum- 
stances of each case. It has been found desirable as the demand 
for the power and the area within which it is supplied has enlarged, 
not only to increase the number of central stations but also their 
capacity. The first pumping station erected was installed with 4 
pumping engines of 200 h.p. each. The pumping capacity of this 
station has been increased to 7 units. The station at Rotherhithc 
completed in 1904 has 8 units together 1600 h.p., and the plant 
at the new station at Grosvenor Road has 8 units equalling 2400 h.p. 
The pumping stations are situated about 3 m. apart and concurrently 
with the increase in their size it has been found desirable to intro- 
duce a system of feeder mains (see below). 

There are in all five central stations at work in connexion with 
the public supply of hydraulic power in London, having an aggregate 
of 7000 i.h.p. All the stations and mains are connected together and 
worked as one system. There are 14 accumulators with a total 
capacity of 4000 gallons, most of them having rams 20 in. diameter 
by 23 ft. stroke. The pumping engines are able together to deliver 
11,000 gallons per minute Details of the London supply are given 
in fig. 3 and in table 1. .

The load-factors are calculated on the actual recorded maximum 
output, and not on the estimated capacity of the plant running or 
installed. The daily periods of maximum output are shown in 
fig. 2. The table shows that the load-factors have not been much 
affected either by the increase of the area of supply or by the in- 
creased consumption of power. The coal used has been principally 
Durham small. The capital cost of the London undertaking has 
been about £950,000. In the central station at Wapping, erected 
in 1891, there are si x^ sets of triple-expansion, surface-condensing 
vertical pumping engines of 200 i.h.p. each; six boilers with a 
working pressure of 150 lb per square inch, and two accumulators 
with rams 20 in. diameter by 23 ft. stroke loaded up to 800 lb per 
square inch. The engines run at a maximum piston speed of 250 ft. 
per minute, and the pumps are singlc : acting 4 , driven directly from 
the piston rods. The supply given from this station in 1009 was 
approximately 6,800,000^ gallons per week, and the cost lor fuel, 
wages, superintendence, lighting, repairs and sundry station expenses 
4*28d. per 1000 gallons, the value of the coal used being 14s. 11 -3d. 

{5cr ton in bunkers. The capital cost of the station, including the 
and, was £70,000. The load-factor at this station for 1909 was 
•49, and the supply was maintained for 168 hours per week. The 
conditions are exceptionally favourable, and the figures represent 
the best result that has hitherto been obtained in hydraulic power 
central station work, having regard to the high price of fuel. 

The installation in Hull differs little from the numerous private 
plants at work on the docks and railways of the United Kingdom. 
The value^ of the experiment was chiefly commercial, and the 
large public hydraulic power works established since are to be 
directly attributed to the Hull undertaking. In Birmingham gas 
engines are employed to drive the pumps. In Liverpool there are 
two central stations. The working pressure is 850 lb per square inch. 
There are 27 m. of mains, and about 1100 machines at work. In 
Manchester and Glasgow the pressure adopted is 1100 lb per square 
inch. In Manchester this pressure was selected principally in view 
of the large number of hydraulic packing presses used in the city, 
and the result has been altogether satisfactory. The works were 
established by the corporation in 1894, the central station being 
designed for 1200 i.h.p. Another station has since been built of 
equal capacity, and nearly 5 million gallons per week are being 
supplied to work about 2100 machines. Twenty-three miles 01 
mains are laid. 

In Antwerp a regular system of high-pressure hydraulic power 
transmission was established in 1894 specially to provide electric 
light for the city. The scheme was due to von Kysslcburgh, an 
electrical engineer of Ghent, who came to the conclusion that the 
most economical way of installing the electric light was to have a 
central hydraulic station, and from it transmit the power through 
pipes to various sub-stations in the town, where it could be converted 
by means of turbines and dynamos into electric energy. The coal 
cost of the electricity supplied — o*88d. per kw. hour — compares 
favourably with most central electric supply stations, although the 
efficiency of the turbines and dynamos used for the conversion does 
not exceed <io %. Von Ryssleburgh argued that hydraulic pumping 
engines would be more economical than steam-engines and dynamos, 
and that the loss in transmission from the central station to the 
consumer would be less with hydraulic converters than if the current 
were distributed directly. The loss in conversion, however, proved 
to be twice as great as had been anticipated, owing largely to defec- 
tive apparatus and to under-estimation of the expense of maintaining 
the converting stations; and the net result was commercially un- 
satisfactory. 

At Buenos Aires hydraulic mains are laid in the streets solely 
for drainage purposes. Each of the sumps, which are provided at 
intervals, contains two hydraulic pumps which automatically pump 
the sewage from a small section of the town into an outfall sewer 
at a higher level. The districts where this system is at work lie 
below the general drainage level of Buenos Aires. The average 
efficiency (pump h.p. to i.h.p.) is 41 %, which is high, having regard to 
the low heads against which the pumps work. In this application 
all the conditions are favourable to hydraulic, power transmission. 
The work is intermittent, there is direct action of the hydraulic 
pressure in the machines, and the load at each stroke of the pumps is 
constant. The same system has been adopted for the, drainage of 
Woking and district, and a somewhat similar installation is in use 
at Margate. 

Hydraulic power is supplied from the hydraulic mains on a sliding 
scale according to the quantity consumed. The minimum charge 
in London except for very large quantities is is. 6d. per 1000 gallons. 
In 1000 gallons at 750 lb per square inch there is an energy of 
10,000 X 1730 ct8 . 74 h p hours; thus ls m. per 1000 gallons =2d. 
33»oooxoo 

per h.p. hour nearly. This amount is made up approximately of 9d. 
per 1000 gallons for the cost of generation, distribution and general 
expenses including rates and 9<T. for capital charges. The average 
rate charged to consumers in 1908 was about 2s. 4d. per 1000 gallons. 
Even under the most favourable circumstances it does not appear 
probable that hydraulic power at 750 lb per square inch can be 
supplied from central stations in towns on a commercial basis over 
any considerable areas at less than is. per 1000 gallons. Allowing

POWER TRANSMISSION 



[HYDRAULIC 



75% as the efficiency of the motor through which the power is 
utilized, this rate would give i*83d. per brake or effective h. p. hour. 
This cost seems high, and it is difficult to believe that it is the best 
hydraulic power transmission can accomplish having regard to the 
well-established fact that the mechanical efficiency of a steam pump- 
ing engine is greater than any other application of a steam-engine, 
and that the power can be conveyed through mains without any 
material loss for considerable distances. Still, no other system of 
power transmission except gas seems to be better off, and there 
is no method of transmission by which energy could, at the present 
time, be supplied retail in towns with commercial success at such 
an average rate when steam is employed as the prime mover. The 
average rate charged for hydraulic power in London and elsewhere 




Fig. 4. 

is much the same as the average rate charged for the supply of 
electrical energy to the ordinary consumer. Gas is undoubtedly 
cheaper, but in a large number of cases is mechanically inconvenient 
in its application. Hydraulic pressure, electrical energy and com- 
pressed air (with reheating) can all be transmitted throughout 
towns with approximately the same losses and at the same cost, 
because the power is obtained in each system from coal, boilers, 
and steam-engines, and the actual loss in transmission can be kept 
down to a small percentage. The use of any particular system of 
power does not, however, primarily depend upon the cost of running 
the central station and distributing the power, but mainly upon the 
mechanical convenience of the system for the purpose to which it 
is applied. One form of energy is, in practice, found most useful 
for one purpose, another form for another and no one can command 
the whole field.

When water is employed as the fluid in hydraulic transmission 
the effects of frost must usually be provided against. In London 
and other towns, the water, before being pumped 
Precautions mfc0 t h e mains, is passed through the surface condensers 
pf» l °* tne en g mes > s as t0 T3Llse * lts temperature. The mains 

™ are laid 3 ft. below the surface of the ground. Exposed 

pipes and cylinders are clothed, and means provided for draining 
them when out of use. When these simple precautions are adopted 
damage from frost is very rare. In special cases oil having a low 
freezing point is used, and in small plants good results have been 
obtained by mixing glycerin and methylated spirit with the water. 



A few gas jets judiciously distributed are of value where there is a 
difficulty in properly protecting the machinery by clothing. 

.From the central station the hydraulic power must be transmitted 
through a system of mains to the various points at which it is to be 
used. In laying out a network of mains it is first neces- _ ; „ 
sary to determine what velocity of flow can be allowed. JJ r 
Owing to the weight of water, the medium usually °"* 
employed for hydraulic transmission, a low velocity is necessary in 
order to avoid shocks. The loss of pressure due ,to the velocity is

independent of the actual pressure employed, and at moderate 
velocities of 3 to 4 ft. per second the loss per 1000 yds. is almost a 
negligible quantity at a pressure of 700 lb per square inch. For 
practical purposes Box's formula is sufficiently accurate — 

Loss of head= *»i lons ' Xle ? gt , h in ^ rd ? v .. - There is a further 
(diameter of pipes in inches X3) 5 

loss due to obstruction caused by valves and bends, but it has been 

found in London that a pressure of 750 lb at the central accumulators 

is sufficient to ensure a pressure of 700 lb throughout the system. 

The greatest distance the power is conveyed from the central stations 

in London is about 4 m. The higher the initial velocity the more 

variable the pressure ; and in order to avoid this variation in any large 

system of mains it is usual to place additional accumulators at a

distance from the central station. They act in the same way as 
air-vessels. The mains should be laid in circuit, and valves placed 
at intervals, so that any section can be isolated ^ for repairs or for 
making connexions without affecting the 
supply at other points. The main valves 
adopted in London are shown in fig. d. 
Valves are also fixed to control all branch 
pipes, while relief valves, washouts and 
air valves are fixed as required. 

The largest pipes used in London are 
10 in. internal diameter, and the 
smallest laid in the streets are 2 in. The 
pipes from 8 in. and below are usually 
made in cast iron, flanged and provided 
with spigots and faucets. The joint 
(fig. 5) is made with a gutta-percha ring, 
though sometimes asbestos and leather 
packing rings are used. Cast iron pipes 
for hydraulic power transmission have 
been standardized by the Engineering 
Standards Committee. Fig. 6 shows 
the 10 in. steel main as used in London. 
The main was laid in 1903 from the 
Rotherhithc Pumping Station of the 
London Hydraulic Power Company 
through the Tower Subway, and is used 
as a feeder main for supply to the City. 
It is the first instance of the use of 
feeder mains in hydraulic transmission. 
The velocity of flow is 6 ft. per second, 
and is automatically disconnected from 
the general system should the pressure 
in this main fall below that of accumula- 
tor pressure. Other mains, similarly 
controlled, are now in use. Ellington's 
system of hydraulic feeder mains has 
been developed by the laying of a 6-in. 
steel main from the Falcon Wharf 
Station at Blackfriars to the Strand, 
over Waterloo Bridge. 

The Falcon Wharf Pumping Station 
at Blackfriars was the original central 
station in London, and the accumulators 
there are loaded to 750 lb per square inch. 
The other pumping stations are situated 
about 3 m. from Falcon W r harf and 
about the same distance from each 
other. The accumulator pressure at the 
outlying stations is during the busy time 
of the day maintained at about 800 lb 
per square inch. ^ Consequently the 
smaller variations in demand for power 
throughout the system caused very 
intermittent running of the plant at 
Falcon Wharf, and the load-factor there 
is very low. The pumping plant has 
now been considerably increased, and 
part of the plant is constructed to pump 
into the feeder main at pressures of 800, 
900, or 1000 lb per square inch according 
to the demand existing from hour to hour 
in the Strand district. By this means the 
output from Falcon Wharf has been 
doubled with a much improved load- 
factor. The accumulator in this system 
is of special construction (fig. 7). The 
pressure 750 lb per sauare inch is main- 
tained in the cylinder A from the ordinary 
hydraulic supply main. The working 
ram B forms the cylinder for the fixed 
hollow ram C which is connected to the 
6 in. bore feeder main D. The balancing 
rams E, E attached to the fixed head F 
serve the purpose of adjusting the pres- 
sure in the feeder main from 800 to 
1000 lb per square inch according to the 
quantity of pressure water required to be 
transmitted through it. The higher 
pressure is required when the velocity 
in this main is 10 ft. per second. There 
is an automatic control valve at the 
junction of the feeder main with the 
service mains in the Strand, adjusted so 
that the same^ effect is produced as if a 
pumping station were in operation at 
that point of equal capacity to the maxi- 
mum flow through the 6 in. main. The 
length of the feeder main in this case is 
2000 yds., and at 10 ft. per second there | 
is a loss of pressure of 240 lb per square

inch, but the effect on the coal consumption is almost negligible, as the 
maximum flow is seldom needed. The engines are specially con- 
structed to take the pressure overload. The feeder main is made of 
steel. The economical limit of the use of feeder mains is reached 
when the additional running expenses involved equal the annual 
value of the saving effected in the capital expenditure. 

In public supplies the power used is in all cases registered by 
meters, and since 1887 automatic instruments have been used at the 
central stations to record the amount supplied at each 
instant during the day and night. The ratio between Reghira- 
the power registered at the consumers' machines and the * 

power sent into the mains is the commercial efficiency of the whole 
system. The loss may be due to leakage from the mains or to defects 
in the meters ; or if, as is often the case, the exhaust from the machines 
is registered, to wasteon the consumers' premises. The automatic 
recorders give the maximum and minimum supplies during 24 hours 
every day, the maximum record showing the power required for a 
given number and capacity of machines, and the minimum giving 
an indication of the leakage. It has been found practicable to 
obtain an efficiency of 95% in most public power transmission 
plants over a series of years, but great care is required to produce so 
good a result. In some years 98% has been registered. Until 
1888 no meters were available for registering a pressure of 700 lb 
per square inch, and all that could be done was to register the water 
after it had passed through the machines and lost its pressure. This 
method is still largely adopted; but now high-pressure meters give 
excellent results, exhaust registration is being superseded to a con- 
siderable extent by the more satisfactory arrangement of registering 
the power on its entry into the consumers' premises. In Manchester 
Kent's high-pressure meters are now used exclusively. Venturi 
meters have also been used with success for registering automatically 
the velocity of flow, and, by integration, the quantity in hydraulic 
power mains, and form a most useful check on the automatic 
recorders. The water after the pressure has been eliminated by 
passage through the machines, may run to a drain or be led back to 
the central station in return mains; the method adopted is a question 
of relative cost and convenience. 

We proceed to the machines actuated by hydraulic power, and 
by a comparisonof the useful work done by them with the work 
done by the engines and boilers at the central station Macbtnerv 
the mechanical efficiency of the system as a whole can 
be gauged. At the central station and in the distribution there is 
no great difficulty in determining the efficiency within narrow limits; * 
it should be 80% at the point of entry to the machine in which 
the pressure is used. 

Where feeder mains are in use the efficiency of the system is neces- 
sarily reduced, owing to the higher velocities allowable in the feeder 
mains. Mechanical efficiency is then sacrificed for the sake of 
economy. The mechanical efficiency of the machines is a very 
uncertain quantity; the character of the machines and the nature 
of the conditions are so variable that a really accurate general 
statement is impossible. In most cases the losses in the machine 
are practically constant for a given size and speed of working; con- 
sequently the efficiency of a given machine may vary within very 
wide limits according to the work it has to do. For instance, a 
hydraulic pump of a given capacity, delivering the water to an 
elevation of 100 ft., will have an efficiency of 80%; but if the eleva- 
tion of discharge is reduced to 15 ft., even though the hydraulic- 
pressure rams may be proportioned to the reduced head, the efficiency 

falls below 50 %. The ultimate efficiency of the system, or P u ™P n -P- 

l.n.p., 
in the one case is 64%, and in the other under 40%. In crane or lift 
work the efficiency varies with the size of the apparatus, with the 
load and with the speed. Efficiency in this sense is a most uncertain 
guide. Some of the most useful and successful applications of 
hydraulic power — as, for instance, hydraulic capstans for hauling 
wagons in railway goods yards — have a very low efficiency ex- 
pressed on the ratio of work done to power expended. Hydraulic 
cranes for coal or grain hoisting have a high efficiency when well 
designed, but it is now very usual to employ grabs to save the labour 
of filling the buckets, and their use lowers the efficiency, expressed 
in tons of coal or grain raised, by 33 % or even 50 %. When hydrau- 
lic machines are fully loaded, 50% to 60% of the indicated power 
of the central station engine is often utilized in useful work done 
with a radius of 2 or 3 m. from the station. In very favourable 
circumstances the efficiency may rise to over 70% and in a 
great many cases in practice it no doubt falls below 25%. If, 
however, energy in any form pan be obtained ready for use at a 
moderate rate, the actual efficiency of the machines (i.e. the ratio 
of the useful work done to the energy absorbed in the process) is 
not of very great importance where the use is intermittent. 

Hydraulic pressure is more particularly advantageous in cases 
where the incompressibility of the fluid employed can be utilized, 
as in hydraulic lifts, cranes and presses. Hydraulic machines for 
these purposes have the peculiar and distinct advantage of direct 
action of the pressure on the moving rams, resulting in simplicity 
of construction, slow and steady, movement of the working 
parts, absence of mechanical brakes" and greatest safety in action. 
When the valve regulating the admission of the pressure to the 
hydraulic cylinder is closed, the water is shut in, and, as it is 



232 



POWER TRANSMISSION 



[PNEUMATIC 



incompressible, the machine is locked. Thus all hydraulic machines 
possess an inherent brake; indeed, many of them are used solely as 
brakes. 

Hydraulic power transmission does not possess the flexibility of 
electricity, its useful applications being comparatively limited, but 
the^simplicity, efficiency, durability and reliability of typical hydrau- 
lic apparatus is such that it must continue to occupy an important 
position in industrial development. 

Sometimes a much higher pressure than 700 lb or 1000 ft) per 
square inch is desirable, more particularly for heavy presses and for 
machine tools such as are used for riveting, for punching, shearing, 
&c. The development of these applications has been largely due 
to the very complete machinery invented and perfected by R. H. 
Tweddell. One of the principal installations of this kind was erected 
in 1876 at Toulon dockyard, where the machines are all connected 
with a system of mains of 2^-in. bore and about 1700 yds. long, laid 
throughout the yard, and kept charged at a pressure of 1500 lb per 
square inch by engines of 100 h.p. with two large accumulators. 
Marc Berrier-Fontaine, the superintending engineer of the dockyard, 
stated that the economy of the system over the separately-driven 
geared machines formerly used is very great. But while pressures 
so high as 3 tons per square inch (as in the 12, 000- ton Armstron^- 
Whitworth press) have been used for forging and other presses, it is 
not desirable, in the distribution of hydraulic power for general 
purposes, that 1000 lb per square inch should 
be much exceeded ; otherwise the rams, which 
form the principal feature in nearly all 
hydraulic machines, if proportioned to the 
work required, will often becorne inconveni- 
ently small, and other mechanical difficulties 
will arise. The cost of the machinery also 
tends to become greater. In^ particular cases 
the working pressure can be increased to any 
desired extent by means of an intensifier 

(fig. 8). 

An important application of hydraulic 
power transmission is for ship work, the 
system being largely adopted both in H.M. 
navy and for merchant vessels. Hydraulic 
coal-discharging machinery was fitted by 
Armstrong as early as 1854 on board a small 
steamer, and in 1868 some hopper barges on 
the Tyne were supplied with hydraulic cranes. 
A. Betts Brown of^ Edinburgh applied 
hydraulic power to ship work in 1873, and 
in the same year the first use of this power 
for gunnery work was effected by G. M.Rendel 
on H.M.S. " Thunderer." The pressure usu- 
ally employed in H.M. navy is 1000 lb per 
square inch. Accumulators are not used and 
the engines have to be fully equal to supply 
directly the whole demand. The distance 
through which the power has to be trans- 
mitted is, of course, very short, and the high 
velocity of 20 ft. per second is allowed in the 
main pipes. The maximum engine-power 
required under these conditions on the larger ships is very consider- 
able. A recent development of hydraulic power on board ship is 
the Stone-Lloyd system of closing bulkhead doors. In hydraulic 
transmission of power it is usually the pressure which is employed, 
but there are one or two important cases in which the velocity of 
flow due to the pressure is utilized in the machine. Reference has 
already been made to the use of turbines working at 750 lb per 
square inch at Antwerp. The Pelton wheel has also been found to 
be adapted for use with such high pressures. Another useful ap- 
plication of the velocity due to the head in hydraulic transmission is 
in an adaptation of the well-known jet pump to fire hydrants.^ The 
value of the system of hydraulic transmission for the extinction of 
fire can hardly be overestimated where, as in London and most 
large towns, the ordinary pressure in the water mains is insufficient 
for the purpose.

III. — Pneumatic 

Every wind that blows is an instance of the pneumatic 

transmission of power, and every windmill or sail that catches 

the breeze is a demonstration of it. The modern or technical 

use of the term, however, is confined to the compression of air

at one point and its transmission to another point where it is 
used in motors to do work. The first recorded instance of this 
being done was by Denis Papin (b. 1647), who compressed air 
with power derived from a water-wheel and transmitted it 
through tubes to a distance. About 1800 George Medhurst (1 750/- 
1827) took out patents in England for compressing air. He 
compressed and transmitted air which worked motors, and he 
built a pneumatic automobile. William Mann in 1829 took out 
a patent in England for a compound air compressor. In his 
appb'cation he states: "The condensing pumps used in 
compressing I make of different capacities, according to the 
densities of the fluid to be compressed, those used to compress 
the higher densities being proportionately smaller than those 
previously used to compress it to the first or lower densities" 
&c. This is a very exact description of the best methods of 
compressing air to-day, omitting the very important inter-cooling. 
Baron Van Rathen in 1849 proposed to compress air in stages 
and to use inter-coolers between each stage ,to get 750 lb 
pressure for use in locomotives. For the next forty years 
inventors tried without success all manner of devices for cooling 
air during compression by water, either injected into the cylinder 
or circulated around it, and finally, with few exceptions, settled 
down to direct compression with no cooling worthy of mention. 
Only in the last ten years of the 19th century were the funda- 
mental principles of economical air compression put into general 
practice, though all of them are contained in the patent of 
William Mann and the suggestion of Van Rathen. 

The first successful application of compressed air to the trans- 
mission of power, as we know it, was at the Mont Cenis Tunnel in 
1 86 1. The form of compressor used was a system of water 
rams — several of them in succession — in which water was the 
piston, compressing the air upwards in the cylinder and forcing 
it out. Although the air came in contact with the water, it 
was not cooled, except slightly a.t the surface of the water and 
around the walls of the cylinders. The compressors were loca- 
ted near the .tunnel, and the compressed air was transmitted 
through pipes to drilling machines working at the faces in the 
tunnel. Rotary drills were tried first, but were soon replaced 
by percussion drills adapted from drawings in the United 
States Patent Office, copied by a French and Italian commission 
from the patent of J. W. Fowle of Philadelphia. H. S. Drinker 
(Tunneling, Explosive Compounds and Rock Drills, New York, 
1893) states positively that the first percussion drill ever made 
to work successfully was patented by J. J. Couch of Philadelphia 
in 1849. Shortly afterwards Fowle patented his drills, in which 
the direct stroke and self-rotating principle was used as we use 
it now. The first successful drill in the Hoosac Tunnel was 
patented in 1866 by W. Brooks, S. F. Gates and C. Burleigh, 
but after a few months was replaced by one made by Burleigh, 
who had bought Fowle's patent and improved it. Burleigh made 
a compressor, cooling the air during compression by an injected 
spray of water in the cylinders. The successful work in the 
Mont Cenis and Hoosac Tunnels with the percussion drilling 
machines caused the use of compressed air to spread rapidly, 
and it was soon found there were many other purposes for which 
it could be employed with advantage. 

The larger tunnels and metal mines were naturally the earliest 
to adopt pneumatic transmission, often using it for pumping 
and hoisting as well as drilling. In Paris and Nantes, in Berne 
and in Birmingham (England), street tramways have been 
operated by pneumatic power, the transmission in these, however, 
being in tanks rather than pipes. Tanks on the cars are 
filled at the central loading stations with air at very high pressure, 
which is used in driving the motors, enough being taken to enable 
the car to make a trip and return to the loading station. Several 
attempts in pneumatic street traction were made in America, 
but failed owing to financial troubles and the successful intro- 
duction of electric traction. It is used very successfully, 
however, both in Europe and in America, in underground mine 
haulage, being especially adapted to coal mines, where electricity 
would be dangerous from its sparks. The copper smelting works 
at Anaconda, Montana, U.S.A., uses twelve large pneumatic

locomotives for charging the furnaces, removing slag, &c. Many 
stone quarries have a central plant for compressing air, which 
is transmitted through pipes extending to all working points, 
and operates derricks, hoists, drills, stone cutters, &c, by means 
of motors. Every considerable ironworks, railroad shop or 
foundry has its pneumatic transmission plant. Also in the 
erection of the larger steel bridges or buildings a pneumatic 
transmission system is part of the contractor's outfit, and many 
railways have a portable compressing plant on a car ready to 
be moved to any point as needed. 

Dr Julius G. Pohle, of Arizona, patented in 1886, and intro- 
duced extensively, the use of compressed air for lifting water 
directly, by admitting it into the water column. His plan is 
largely adopted in artesian wells that do not flow, or do not 
flow as much as desired, and is so arranged that the air supply 
has a back pressure of water equal to at least half the lift. If it 
is desired to lift the water 30 ft. the air is admitted to the 
water column at least 30 ft. below the standing water surface. 
The air admitted being so much lighter than the water it dis- 
places, the column 60 ft. high becomes lighter than the column 
30 ft. high and is constantly released and flows out at the top. 
The efficiency of this method is only 20 to 40%, depending on 
the lift, but its adaptation to artesian wells renders it valuable 
in many localities. 

A remarkable pneumatic transmission system was installed 
in 1890 by Priestly in the Snake River Desert, Idaho, 
U.S.A. On the north side of the river is a cliff, nearly perpen- 
dicular, about 300 ft. high. One hundred and ninety feet above 
the river, for a considerable distance along the cliff, streams of 
water gush out from between the bottom of the great lava bed 
and the hardened clay of the old lake bottom. Priestly, without 
knowledge of Pohle's system, built a pipe line down the bluff and 
trained the water into it in such a way that it carried a very 
considerable quantity of air in the form of bubbles along with 
it down the pipe, compressing it on the way. The air was col- 
lected at the bottom in a covered reservoir, and taken up the 
cliff again to the lower part of an inverted siphon pipe, one side 
of which reached down from the water-supply about 60 ft. and 
the other side reached up and over the bluff. Allowing the water 
to fill both sides of the pipe to the level of the water-supply, he 
admitted his compressed air at about 75 lb pressure into the 
long side of the pipe near the bottom, and soon had water flowing 
upwards over the cliff and irrigating a large tract of rich lava 
land. He had made a power, a transmission and a motor plant 
without a moving part. A similar compressor was installed 
near Montreal, Canada, in 1896; another at Ainsworth, British 
Columbia, in 1898; and another at Norwich, Connecticut, U.S.A., 
in 1902. These are called hydraulic air compressors and show 
an efficiency of about 70%. They are particularly adapted to 
positions where there is a large flow of water with a slight fall or 

head. 

The actual transmission of power by air from the compressor to 
the motor is simple and effective. The air admits of a velocity of 
15 to 20 ft. per second through pipes, with very slight Joss by friction, 
and consequently there is no necessity for an expensive pipe system 
in proportion to the power transmitted. It is found in practice 
that, allowing a velocity as given above, there is no noticeable 
difference in pressure between the compressor and the motor several 
miles away. Light butt-welded tubing is largely used for piping, 
and if properly put in there is very slight loss from leakage, which, 
moreover, can be easily detected and stopped. In practice, a 
sponge with soap-suds passed around a joint furnishes a detective 
agency, the escaping air blowing soap bubbles. In good practice 
there need not be more than 1 % loss through leakage and 1 % 
possibly through friction in the pneumatic transmission of power. 
■ Air develops heat on compression and is cooled by expansion, 
and it expands with heat and contracts with cold. For the purpose 
of illustration suppose a cylinder 10 ft. long containing 10 cub. ft. 
of air at 6o° F., with a frictionlcss piston at one end. If this piston 
be moved 7$ ft. into the cylinder, so that the air is compressed to one- 
quarter of its volume, and none of the heat developed by compression 
be allowed to escape, the air will be under a pressure of 90 lb per 
square inch and at a temperature of 460 F. If this air be cooled 
down to 6o° F. the pressure will be reduced to 45 lb per square inch, 
showing that the heat produced in the air itself during compression 
gives it an additional expansive force of 45 ^ lb per square inch. The 
average force or pressure in compressing this air without loss of heat 



is 21 lb per square inch, whereas if all the heat developed 
during compression had been removed as rapidly as developed 
the average pressure on the piston would have been only 11 lb 
per square inch, showing that the heat developed in the air 
during compression, when not removed as fast as developed, 
caused in this case an extra force of 10 lb per square inch to be used 
on the piston. If this heated air could be transmitted and used 
without any loss of heat the extra force used in compressing it could 
be utilized ; but in practice this is impossible, as the heat is lost in 
transmission. If the piston holding the 2 J cub. ft. of air at 45 lb per 
square inch and at 6o° F. were released the air expanding without 
receiving any heat would move it back within 3$ ft. of the end only, 
and the temperature of the air would be lowered 170° F., or to 1 io° F. 
below zero.^ If the air were then warmed to 60 F. a^ain it would 
move the piston the remaining 3$ ft. to its starting point. 

It is seen that the ideal air-compressing machine is one which will 
take all the heat from the air as rapidly as it is developed during 
compression. Such " isothermal compression " is never reached in 
practice, the best work yet done lacking 10% of it. It follows that 
the most inefficient compressing machine is one which takes away 
no heat during compression — that is, works by " adiabatic compres- 
sion," which in practice has been much more nearly approached 
than the ideal. It ajso follows that the ideal motor for using com- 
pressed air is one which will supply heat to the air as required when 
it is expanding. Such " isothermal " expansion is often attained, 
and sometimes exceeded, in practice by supplying heat artificially. 
Finally, themost inefficient motor for using compressed air is one 
which supplies no heat to the air during its expansion, or works by 
adiabatic expansion, which was long very closely approached by 
most air motors. In practice isothermal compression is approached 
by compressing the air slightly, then cooling it, compressing it slightly 
again, and again cooling it until the desired compression is com- 
pleted. This is called compression in stages or compound compres- 
sion. ^ Isothermal expansion is approximately accomplished by 
allowing the air to do part of its work (as expanding slightly in a 
cylinder) and then warming it, then allowing it to do a little more 
and then warming it again, and so continuing until expansion is 
complete. It will be seen that the air is carefully cooled during 
compression to prevent the heat it develops from working against 
compression, and even more carefully heated during expansion to 
prevent loss from cold developed during expansion. More stages 
of compression of course give a higher efficiency, but the cost of 
machinery and friction losses have to be considered. The reheating 
of air is often a disadvantage, especially in mining, where there are 
great objections to having any kind of combustion underground; 
but where reheating is possible, as W. C. Unwin says, " for the 
amount of heat supplied the economy realized in the weight of air 
used is surprising. The reason for this is, the heat supplied to the 
air is used nearly five times as efficiently as_ an equal amount of 
heat employed in generating steam." Practically there is a hot- 
air engine, using a medium much more effective than common air, 
in addition to a compressed-air engine, making the efficiency of the 
whole system extremely high. (A. De W. F.) 

IV. — Electrical 
Though the older methods of power transmission, such as 
wire ropes, compressed air and high-pressure water, are still 
worked on a comparatively small scale, the chief commercial 
burden has fallen upon the electric generator and motor linked 
by a transmission line. The efficiency of the conversion from 
mechanical power to electrical energy and back again is so high, 
and the facility of power distribution by electric motors is so 
great, as "to leave little room for competition in any but very 
exceptional cases. The largest single department of electrical 
power transmission — that is, transmission for traction purposes 
— is at present almost wholly carried on by continuous currents. 
The usual voltage is 500 to 600, and the motors are almost uni- 
versally series- wound constant-potential machines. The total 
amount of such transmission in daily use reaches probably a 
million and a half horse power. In long distance power trans- 
mission proper continuous currents are not used to any con- 
siderable extent, owing mainly to the difficulty of generating 
continuous currents at sufficient pressure to be available for 
such w r ork, and the difficulty of reducing such pressure, even 
if it could be conveniently obtained, far enough to render it 
available for convenient distribution at the receiving end of the 
line. Single continuous current machines have seldom been 
built successfully for more than about 2000 to 3000 volts, if at 
the same time they were required to deliver any considerable 
amount of current. About 300 to 500 kilowatts per machine 
at this voltage appears to be the present limit, although it is 
by no means unlikely that the use of commutating poles and 



234- 



POWER TRANSMISSION 



other improvements may considerably increase these figures. 
For distances at which more than this very moderate voltage is 
desirable one must either depend on alternating currents or 
use machines in series. In American practice the former alter- 
native is universally taken. On the continent of Europe a 
very creditable degree of success has been achieved by adopting 
the latter, and many plants upon this system are in use, mostly 
in Switzerland. In these generators are worked at constant 
current, a sufficient number in series being employed to give 
the necessary electromotive force. 

Power Transmission at Constant Current. — In this system, 
which has been developed chiefly by M. Thury, power is trans- 
mitted from constant current generators worked in series, and 
commonly coupled mechanically in pairs or larger groups 
driven by a single prime mover. The individual generators 
are wound for moderate currents, generally between 50 and 
150 amperes, and deliver this ordinarily at a maximum voltage 
of 2000 to 3500, the output per armature seldom being above 
300 kw. For the high voltages needed for long distance 
transmission as many generators as may be required are thrown 
in series. In the Moutiers-Lyons transmission of no m., 
the most considerable yet installed on this system, there are 
four groups, each consisting of four mechanically-coupled genera- 
tors. The common current is 75 amp., and the maximum 
voltage per group is about 15,000 volts, giving nearly 60,000 
volts as the transmission voltage at maximum load. In the 
St Maurice-Lausanne transmission of about 35 m. the constant 
current is 150 amp. and the voltage per armature is 2300, 
five pairs being put in series* for the maximum load voltage of 
23,000. 

Regulation in such plants is accomplished either by varying the 
field strength through an automatic governor or by similarly varying 
the speed of the generators, _ Either method gives sufficiently good 
results. The transmission circuit is of the simplest character, and 
the power is received by motors, or for local distribution by motor 
generators, heM to speed by centrifugal governors controlling field- 
varying mechanism. For large output the motors, like the generators, 
are in groups mechanically coupled and in series. In the Moutiers- 
Lyons transmission motor-generators are even designed to give 
a three-phase constant potential distribution, and in reverse to 
permit interchange of enerjry between the continuous current and 
several polyphase transmission systems. 

The advantages of the system reside chiefly in easier line insulation 
than with alternating currents and in the abolition of the difficulties 
due to line inductance and capacity. It is probably as easy to insulate 
for 100,000 volts continuous current as for 50,000 volts alternating 
current. Part of the difference is due to the fact that in the latter 
case the crestof the E.M.F. wave reaches nearly 75,000 volts, and in 
addition static effects and minor resonant rise of voltage must be 
reckoned with. _ There is some {possibility, therefore, of the advantage- 
ous use of continuous current in case very great distances, requiring 
enormous voltages, have to be covered. In addition, a constant 
current plant is^ at full voltage only at brief and rare periods of 
maximum load instead of all the time, which greatly increases the 
average factor of safety in insulation. 

On the other hand, the constant current generators are relatively 
expensive^ and of inconveniently small individual output for large 
transmission work, and require very elaborate precautions in the 
matter of insulation. Their efficiency is a little less than that of 
large alternators, but the difference is partially off-set by the 
transformers used with the latter for any considerable voltage. 
A characteristic advantage of the constant current system is the 
extreme simplicity and cheapness of the switching arrangements as 
compared with thecomplication and cost of the ordinary switch-board 
lor a polyphase station at high voltage. Comparing station with 
station as a whole it is at least an open question whether the poly- 
phase system would have any material advantage in cost per kw. 
in an average case. The principal gains of the alternating systems 
appear in the relative simplicity of the distribution. In dealing with 
a few large power units the constant current system has the best 
of the argument in efficiency, but in the ordinary case of widespread 
distribution for varied purposes the advantage is quite the other 
way. 

The high-voltage constant-current plant lends itself with especial 
ease to operation, at least in emergency, over a grounded circuit. In 
some recent plants, e.g. Moutiers-Lyons, provision is made at the 
sub-stations for grounding the central point of the system and either 
line in case of need, and in point of fact the voltage drop in working 
grounded is found to be within moderate and practicable limits. 

The possibilities of improvement in the system have by no means 
been worked out, and although it has been overshadowed by the 



[ELECTRICAL 

enormous growth of polyphase transmission it must still be considered 
seriously. 

Transmission by Alternating Current. — The alternating current 
has conspicuous advantages. In the first place, whatever the 
voltage of transmission, the voltage of generation and that of 
distribution can be brought within moderate limits at a very 
high degree of efficiency by the use of transformers; and, in the 
second place, it is possible to build alternating-current generators 
of any required capacity, and for voltages high enough to permit 
the abolition of raising transformers except in unusual circum- 
stances. At present such generators, giving 10,000 to 13,500 
volts directly from the armature windings, are in common and 
highly successful use; and while the use of raising transformers 
is preferred by some engineers, experience shows that they 
cannot be considered essential, and are probably not desirable 
for the voltages in question, which are as great as at the present 
time seem necessary for the numerical majority of transmission 
plants. Polyphase generators, especially in large sizes, can be 
successfully wound up to more than double the figures just 
mentioned. The plant at Manojlovac, Dalmatia, has been 
equipped with four 30,000 volt three-phase generators, giving 
each about 5000 kw. at 42* with 420 revolutions per minute, 
the full load efficiency being 94%. But for very large trans- 
mission work to considerable distances where much higher 
voltages are requisite such transformers cannot be dispensed 
with. Alternating currents are practically employed in the 
polyphase form, on account both of increased generator output 
in this type of apparatus and of the extremely valuable proper- 
ties of the polyphase induction motors, which furnish a ready 
means for the distribution of power at the receiving end of the line. 
As between two- and three-phase apparatus the present prac- 
tice is about equally divided; the transmission lines themselves, 
however, are, with rare exceptions, worked three-phase, on 
account of the saving of 25% in copper secured by the use of 
this system. Inasmuch as transformers can be freely combined 
vectorially to give resultant electromotive forces having any 
desired magnitudes and phase relations the passage from two- 
phase to three-phase, and back again, is made with the utmost 
ease, and the character of the generating and receiving apparatus 
thus becomes almost a matter of indifference. As regards such 
apparatus it is safe to say that honours are about even: some- 
times one system proves more convenient, sometimes the other. 
The difficulty of obtaining proper single-phase motors for the 
varied purposes of general distribution has so far prevented any 
material use of single-phase transmission systems. 

Generators for Power Transmission. — The generators are usually 
large two- or three-phase machines, and in the majority of instances 
they are driven by water-wheels. Power transmission on a large 
scale from steam plant has, up to the present, made no substantial 
progress, save as the networks of large electrical supply stations 
have in some cases grown to cover radii of many miles. The size 
of these generators varies from 100 or 200 kw. in small plants, 
up to 10,000 or more in the larger ones. Their efficiency ranges 
from 92% or thereabouts in the smaller sizes up to 96% 
or a fraction more in the largest, at full load. The voltage of 
these generators varies greatly. When raising transformers are 
used it is usually from 500 to 2500 volts; without them the genera- 
tors are usually wound for 10,000 to 13,500 volts. Intermediate 
voltages have sometimes been employed, but are rather passing out 
of use, as they seem to fulfil no particularly useful purpose. The 
tendency at the present time, whatever the voltage, is towards the 
use of machines with stationary armatures and revolving field 
magnets, or towards a pure inductor type having all its windings 
stationary. At moderate voltages such an arrangement is merely 
a matter of convenience, but in nigh-voltage generators it is practi- 
cally a necessity. Low- voltage machines are usually provided with 
polyodontal windings, these windings having several separate arma- 
ture teeth per pole per phase, while the high -voltage machines are 
generally monodontal ; in both classes the edges of the pole pieces 
are usually chamfered away in such form as to produce at least a 
close approximation to the sinusoidal form for the electromotive 
force. For this purpose, and to obtain a better inherent regulation 
under variations of load, the field magnets are, or should be, par- 
ticularly powerful. In the best modern generators the variation 
of electromotive force from no load to full load, non-inductive, is 
less than 10% at constant field excitation. Closeness of inherent 
regulation is an important matter in generators for transmission work- ,

POWER TRANSMISSION

inasmuch as there is as yet no entirely successful method of automatic 
voltage regulation on very large units; and the less hand regulation 
the better. Moreover, the design which secures this result also 
tends to secure stability of wave form in the electromotive force, a 
matter of even greater importance. There has been much discussion 
as to the best wave form for use on alternating circuits, it having 
been conclusively shown that for a given fundamental frequency 
the sinusoidal wave does not give the most economical use of iron 
in the transformers. For transmission work, however, particularly 
over long lines, this is a matter of inconceivably small importance 
compared with the stability and the freedom from troubles from 
higher harmonics that result from the use of a wave as nearly sinu- 
soidal as can possibly be obtained. In every alternating circuit 
the odd harmonics are considerably in evidence in the electromotive 
force, either produced by the structure of the generator or introduced 
by the transformers and other apparatus. These are of no particular 
moment in work upon a small scale, but in transmission on a large 
scale to long distances, or especially through underground cables, 
they are, as will be seen in the consideration of the transmission line 
itself, a serious menace. Inasmuch as the periodicity of an alter- 
nating circuit must be maintained sensibly constant for successful 
operation, great care is usually exercised to secure such governing 
of the prime movers as will give constant speed at the generators. 
This can now be obtained, in all ordinary circumstances, by several 
forms of sensitive hydraulic governors which are now in use. The mat- 
ter of absolute periodicity has not yet settled itself into any final form. 
American practice is based largely upon 60 cycles per second, which 
is probably as high a frequency as can be advantageously employed. 
Indeed, even this leads to some embarrassment in securing good 
motors of moderate rotative speed, and the tendency of the frequency 
is rather downward than upward. An inferior limit is set by the 
general desirability of operating incandescent lamps off the trans- 
mission circuits. For this purpose the frequency should be held 
above 30 cycles per second; below this point, flickering of the lamps 
becomes progressively more serious, especially with lamps having 
the very slender metallic filaments now commonly employed — 
so serious, indeed, as practically to prohibit their successful use — 
and plants installed for such low frequencies are generally confined 
to motor practice, or to the use of synchronous converters, which are 
somewhat easier to build in large units at low than at high periodici- 
ties. Occasional plants for railway and heavy motor service operate 
at as low as 15 ~, and more at 2£ ~. Nearly all the general work 
of power transmission, however, is carried on between 30 and 60 ~. 
The inferior limit at_ which it is possible successfully to operate 
alternating arc lamps is about 40 ~ ; and if these are to be an impor- 
tant feature in transmissionsystems the indications are that practice 
will tend towards a periodicity above 40 ~, at which all the accessory 
apparatus can be successfully operated. European _ practice is 
based generally upon a frequency of 50 ~, which admirably meets 
average conditions of distribution. 

Transmission Lines. — Power transmission lines differ from those 
used for general electric distribution principally in the use of higher 
voltage and in the precautions entailed thereby. The economic 
principles of design are precisely the same here as elsewhere, save 
that the conductors vary less in diameter and far more in length. 
Inasmuch as transmission systemsare frequently installed prior to 
the existence of a well-developed distribution system the conditions 
of load and the market for the power transmitted can seldom be 

Sredicted accurately; consequently, the cases are very rare in which 
Kelvin's law can be applied with any advantage; and as it is at 
best confined to determining the most economical conditions at a 
particular epoch this law is probably of less use in power transmission 
than in any other branch of electric distribution. A superior limit 
is set to the permissible loss of energy in the line by the difficulty 
attending regulation for constant potential in case the line loss is 
considerable. The inferior limit is usually set by the undesirability 
of too large an investment in copper, and lines are usually laid out 
from the standpoint of regulation rather than from any other. 
In ordinary practice it seldom proves advantageous to allow more 
than 15% loss in the line even under extreme conditions, and the 
cases are few in which less than 5 % loss is advisable. These few 
cases comprise those in which the demand for power notably over- 
runs the supply as limited by the maximum power available at the 
generating station, and also the few cases in which a loss greater 
than 5% would indicate the use of a line wire too small from a 
mechanical standpoint. It is not advisable to attempt to construct 
long lines of wire smaller than No. 2 American wire-gauge (-257 in. 
diameter},. although occasionally wire as small as No. 4 ('204 in. 
diameter) may safely be employed. Smaller diameter than this 
involves considerable added difficulty of insulation in lines operated 
at # voltages in excess of about 50,000. The vast majority of trans- 
mission lines are composed of overhead conductors. In rare 
instances underground cables are used. In single-phase work these 
are preferably of concentric form, which, however, gets too com- 
plicated in the three-phase lines generally employed to secure 
economy in copper; for the latter, triplicate cables, lead sheathed, 
laid in glazed earthenware ducts, seem to give the best results. 
On account of the cost and the difficulty of repair of such lines they 
are not extensively used, and cables have not yet been produced 
for the extremely high voltages desirable in some very long circuitSj 



although they are readily obtainable for voltages up to 30,000 or 
40,000. As to the material of the conductors, copper is almost 
universally used. For very long spans, however, bronze wire of 
high tensile strength is occasionally employed as a substitute for 
copper wire, and more rarely steel wire; aluminium, too, is beginning 
to come into use for general line work. Bronze of high tensile 
strength (say 80,000 to 1 00,000 lb per square inch) has unfortunately 
less than half the conductivity of copper; and unless spans of many 
hundred feet are to be attempted it is better to use hard-drawn 
copper, which gives a tensile strength of from 60,000 to 65,000 lb to 
the square inch, with a reduction in conductivity of only 3 to 4%. 
As to aluminium, this metal has a tensile strength slightly less than 
that of annealed copper, a conductivity about 60% that of copper, 
and for equal conductivity is almost exactly one-half the weight. 
Mechanically, aluminium is somewhat inferior to copper, as its 
coefficient of expansion with temperature is 50% greater; and its 
elastic limit is very low, the metal tending to take a permanent 
set under comparatively light tension, and being seriously affected 
at less than half its ultimate tensile strength. Joints in aluminium 
wire arc difficult to make, since the present methods of soldering 
are little better than cementing the metal with the flux; in practice 
the joints are purely mechanical, being usually made by means of 
tight-fitting sleeves forced into contact with the wire. With suitable 
caution in stringing, aluminium lines can be successfully used, and 
are likely to serve as a useful defence against increase in the price 
of copper. Whatever the material, most important lines are now 
built of stranded cable, sometimes with a hemp core to give added 
flexibility. 

With respect to line construction the introduction of high 
voltages, say 40,000 and upwards, has made a radical change in 
the situation. The earlier transmission lines were for rather low 
voltages, seldom above 10,000. ^ Insulation was extremely easy, 
and the transmission of any considerable amount of power implied 
heavy or numerous conductors. The line construction therefore 
followed rather closely the precedents set in telegraph and telephone 
construction and in low tension electric light service. In American 
practice the lines were usually of simple wooden^ poles set 40 to 50 
to the mile, and carrying wooden cross-arms furnished with wooden 
pins carrying insulators of glass or porcelain. The poles were little 
larger than those used in telegraph lines, a favourite size being 
a 40-ft. pole about 8 in. in diameter at the top and 15 in. at the butt, 
set 6 to 7 ft. in the earth. Such poles commonly bore two cross- 
arms, the lower and longer carrying 4 pins, and the^ shorter upper 
arm 2 pins, so disposed that the upper pin on each side of the pole 
would form with the^ nearer pins below an equilateral triangle 
18 to 24 in. on the side. The poles therefore carried twothrce- 

?hase circuits one on either side, one or both circuits being spiralled, 
n European practice iron poles have been more. frequently used, 
again following rather closely the model of telegraph practice, with 
similar spacing of poles, and with insulators, usually of porcelain, 
somewhat enlarged and improved over telegraph and electric light 
insulators, and spaced somewhat more widely. As between wooden 
and steel poles, the latter are of course the more durable and much 
the more costly. The difference in cost depends largely on the 
locality, and ultimately on the life of the wooden poles. This ranges 
from two or three up to ten or fifteen years, the latter figures only 
in favourable soils and when the lower ends of the poles nave been 
thoroughly treated with some preservative. Under such conditions 
wood is often ultimately the cheaper material. 

The use of very high voltages results in, for all moderate powers, 
the use of small and consequently light wires and in the necessity for 
heavy, large and costly insulators. For security against leakage and 
failure it becomes desirable to reduce the numer of insulation 
points, and with the resulting lengthening of span to design the line 
as a mechanical structure. A transmission line is subject to three 
sets of stresses. The most considerable are those due to the longi- 
tudinal pull of the catenary depending on the weight and tension of 
the wires. Under ordinary conditions these strains are balanced 
and come into play only when there is breakage of one or more 
wires and consequent unbalancing. It has been the common 
practice to give the poles sufficient strength to withstand this pull 
without failing. The maximum amount of the pull may be safely 
taken at the sum of the elastic limits of the wires, since it is unsafe 
so to design the spans as to be subject to larger stresses. 

There is also lateral stress on a line due to wind acting upon the 
poles and wires, the latter amounting to little unless their diameter 
is increased by a coating of sleet, a condition which gives maximum 
stresses on the line. Wind then tends to push the line over, and it 
also increases the longitudinal stresses, being added geometrically 
to the catenary stress. The actual possibility of wind pressure is 
very generally over-estimated, and has resulted in much needlessly 
costly construction. In the first place, save for actual tornadoes, 
for which no estimates can be given, even the highest winds at the 
level of any ordinary transmission line are of modest actual velocity. 
It is probable that no transmission line save on mountain peaks at a 
very high elevation is ever exposed to an actual wind velocity of 
75 m. per hour, and only at intervals of years is a velocity of even 
60 m. reached near the ground level. Further, the maximum wind 
velocities are practically never reached at very low temperatures 
when the line is under its maximum catenary stress, and sleet 



236 



POWER TRANSMISSION 



[ELECTRICAL 



formation, which takes place only within a very limited temperature 
range, is practically unknown under conditions of maximum wind. 

The relation of wind velocity to pressure in case of a suspended 
wire or cable may be approximately expressed by the equation 
P = 0-002 5V 2 , where P is the pressure per square foot of projected 
area of cable, and V isthe actual wind velocity in miles per hour. 
Except for sleet conditions the wind pressure is, then, a matter of 
little concern. At times sleet may accumulate on bare wires to a 
thickness of half an inch to an inch. Even under these conditions 
the lateral stability of the line is a matter of less concern than 
the added component of stress in the catenary. The third element 
of line stress, the actual crushing stress of the wire load, is of no 
consequence in high voltage transmission work. 

In scientific line design the best examplehas been set by the 
Italian engineers, who, realizing that the longitudinal strains, which 
are very severe in case of breakage of spans rigidly supported from 
pole to pole, are immediately relieved by a slight increase in catenary 
drop, have introduced the principle of longitudinal flexibility. 
The poles or towers of structural steel are so designed as to be 
fairly stiff against lateral pressure and are given secure foundation 
against overturning, but are deliberately designed to deflect length- 
wise the line in the extreme case of breakage of wires so as at once to 
relieve the catenary tension without passing their elastic limit. 
In this way complete security is attained with a minimum of material 
and expense. 

In recent construction both in America and Europe the tendency 
is to use steel poles or towers of ample height, 40 to 60 ft. and spans 
ranging from 300 to 600 ft., occasionally more. The catenary drop 
allowed is considerable, often 3 to* 4% of thespan length. Cross- 
arms and pins, when used, are commonly of iron or steel, and the 
interiors of the insulators are therefore fairly at earth potential. 
The insulators are of dense and hard-baked porcelain, built up of 
three or four shells cemented together to form a whole, with several 
deep petticoats to protect the inner surfaces from wetting. Such 
insulators may be 12 to 18 in. in diameter over all, and from top 
groove to base a little more. If well designed and made, insulators 
of this type can endure even under very neavy precipitation alter- 
nating voltages of 60,000 to 100,000 effective without flashing over, 
and double these figures when dry. For line voltages above 60,000 
to 70,000 it is apparent that the insulating factor of safety would 
be seriously reduced, and some recent lines nave been equipped with 
suspension insulators. These are in effect porcelain bells from 10 in. 
diameter upward strung together like a string of Japanese gongs. 
The bells are all the same size andare spaced about a foot apart, 
the suspensions being variously designed. These insulating groups 
can be as large as need be, and it is easy to push the aggregate insula- 
tion resistance, both dry and wet, far beyond the figures just men- 
tioned. This suspension requires higher^ poles than the ordinary, 
but allows a considerable amount of longitudinal back lash, in case 
a wire burns off. Too extensive slip along the line is checked by 
guys fitted with strain insulators, like the suspension ones, at suitable 
intervals. The suspension insulator gives promise of successful use 
of voltages much higher than 100,000 volts. The wires on high 
voltage systems are generally widely spaced : very seldom less than 
2 ft. between centres, and for the higher voltages something like 1 ft. 
for each 10,000 volts. 

Voltage. — The most important factor in the economy pf the con- 
ducting system is the actual voltage used for the transmission. 
This varies within very wide limits. For transmissions only a few 
miles in length the pressures employed may be from 2000 to 5000 
volts, but for the serious work of power transmission less than 10,000 
volts are now seldom used. This pressure, under all ordinary con- 
ditions and in all ordinary climates, can be and is used with complete 
success, and apparently without any greater difficulty than would 
be encountered at much lower voltage. It is regarded as the stan- 
dard transmission voltage in American practice for short distances 
up to 10 or 15 m. Beyond this, and sometimes even on shorter 
lines, it is greatly increased; up to 20,000 volts there seems to be no 
material difficulty whatever in effecting and maintaining a sufficient 
insulation of the line. In the higher voltages there were in 1908 more 
than fifty plants in regular operation at 40,000 volts and above. 
Of these more than a score are operated at 60,000 volts and above. 
The highest working voltage employed in 1909 was 110,000 volts, 
which was successfully used in two American plants: that of the 
Grand Rapids — Muskegon (Michigan) system,and in the transmission 
work of the Central Colorado system. These both employ suspen- 
sion insulators with five bells in series, and operate with no more 
trouble than falls to the lot of systems using ordinarily high voltages. 
The Rio de Janeiro transmission system, operates at 88,000 volts 
with large porcelain insulators, 17*5 in. in over-all diameter and 19-75 
in height, carried on steel pins; the Kern River (California) plant 
at 75,000 volts with similar construction ; the Missouri River Power 
Co. (Montana) at 70,000 volts, using glass insulators on wooden pins 
saturated with insulating material. There is no especial difficulty 
in building transformers for still higher pressures, the real problem 
lying in the insulation of the line. t Taken as a whole these high 
voltage lines have given good service, those near the upper limit 
doing apparently as well as those near the lower, owing to more 
careful precautions in construction. Likewise the distances of 



transmission have steadily risen. There arc, all told, nearly a score 
of power transmissions over 100 m. in length, the longest distance 
yet covered being from De Sabla to Sausalito (California), a distance 
of 232 m. This, like most other long American transmissions, is at 
60 ~, and it is interesting to note that even over such distances 
there seems to be very little evidence of trouble due to frequency. 
In point of fact, those who have had the most experience with long 
distance transmission are the last to worry about the difficulties 
of using alternating current. Some unusual phenomena turn up 
in high voltage work, but they are rather interesting than alarming. 
The lines become self-luminous from " coronal " discharge at a little 
above 20,000 volts, and at 40,000 or 50,000 volts the phenomenon, 
which is sometimes aggravated by resonance, becomes of a striking, 
not to say startling, character. At above 100,000 volts this coronal 
discharge must be given serious consideration. 

Resonance, in substance, is due to synchronism of the periodic 
electromotive force, or a harmonic thereof, with the electro-magnetic 
time-constant of the system. The frequency of the currents 
actually employed in transmission work is so low that resonance 
with the fundamental frequency must be extremely rare; resonance 
with the harmonics is, however, common — much commoner than is 
generally supposed. In every electromotive force wave the odd 
harmonics are more or less in evidence, particularly the third, fifth 
and seventh. If the electromotive force wave departs notably from 
a sinusoidal form, traces of harmonics up to at least the 15th may 
generally be found; the third, seventh and the alternate higher har- 
monics are manifest in flattening the crest of the wave. Supposing, 
what is seldom quite true, that the harmonics are symmetrically 
disposed in phase with the fundamental, all the harmonics tend 
somewhat to elevate the shoulders of the wave; a wave, therefore, 
with peaked shoulders and a depression in the centre is certain to be 
affected by harmonics, while if it has a high central crest, there is 
evidence of great predominance of the fifth and higher harmonics. 
Generally the harmonics are slightly out of phase with the fundamen- 
tal, so that the wave is both deformed and unsymmetrical. As to the 
amplitude of these harmonics, the third is usually the largest, and 
may sometimes in commercial machines amount to as much as 20% 
of the amplitude of the^ fundamental, and frequently 10%. In 
machines giving nearly sinusoidal waves it is of course much less, 
but it is not difficult to find even the seventh and higher harmonics 
producing variations as great as 5%. Since, other things being 
equal, the rise in electromotive force due to resonance is directly 
proportional to the magnitude of the harmonics, and the chance of 
getting it increases^ rapidly with the presence of those of the higher 
orders^ the desirability of using the closest possible approximation 
to a sinusoidal wave is self-evident. The greater the inductance 
and capacity of the system and the less its ohmic resistance, 
the greater the chance of getting serious resonance. As regards 
the distributed capacity and inductance due to the line alone, the 
ordinary conditions are not at all formidable; the general effect 
of such distributed capacity and inductance is to produce in the 
system a series of static waves, their length varying inversely with 
the frequency. At commercial frequencies the wave length is very 
great, so great that even in the longest lines at present employed 
only a small fraction of a single wave length appears; the total 
length of the line is generally much less than one quarter the com- 
plete wave length, and the only notable effect is a moderate rise of 
potential along the line. The time-constant of the alternating 
circuit is T = '00629 V (LC), where L is the absolute self-induction 
in henrys and C the capacity in microfarads; and if the frequency, 
or a marked harmonic thereof, coincide with this time-period, 
resonance may safely be looked for, and resonance of the harmonics 
may appear conspicuously in lines of ordinary lengths. The follow- 
ing table gives the values, both L and C, per mile of three-phase 
circuit, of the sizes (American wire-gauge) ordinarily employed for 
transmission circuits, the wires being assumed to be strung 48 in.

In cases where underground cables form a part of the system, the 
above values of C are very largely increased, and the probability of 
resonance is in proportion^ enhanced. A still further complication 
is introduced by the capacity and inductance of the apparatus used 
upon the system, which may often be far greater than that due to the 
entire line, even if the latter be of considerable length. In point of 
fact, it is altogether probable that resonance due to the distributed 
capacity and inductance of the overhead line alone is of rare occur- 
rence and generally of trivial amount, while it is equally probable

that resonance due to localized capacity and inductance other than 
that of the line conductors may, and often does, cause very serious 
disturbances upon the system. The subject has never been ade- 
quately investigated, but the tendency towards formidable sparking 
and arcing at various points on long-distance transmission systems 
is generally far greater than can be accounted for by consideration 
of the nominal voltages alone. The conditions may be still further 
complicated by the effect of earths or open circuits, which sometimes 
may produce, temporarily, appalling resonance phenomena, through 
bringing into action the capacity and inductance of the apparatus 
and introducing surges. In ordinary working the resonance of the 
harmonics is not very conspicuous, and the fact that it occurs not 
systematically, but only in special ways and under special conditions, 
indicates more strongly than anything else that the vital point is 
not the time-constant of the line alone, but those of the apparatus 
connected thereto. A definite and persistent tendency towards 
resonance may sometimes be effectively checked by the introduction 
of suitable inductance in the parts of the system most seriously 
affected, but the best general policy is to avoid as far as possible 
the presence of the higher harmonics, which are the chief sources of 
danger. 

Closely allied to and connected with resonance is the phenomenon 
known as " surging," which is due to the discharge of the electro- 
magnetic energy stored in a circuit containing inductance and capa- 
city when that circuit is broken. This discharge is an oscillatory 
one, going on with decreasing amplitude until it is frittered away 
by resistance and other sources of loss. Its frequency is that of the 
system affected, and the surge may get reinforcement from resonance 
proper. It is sufficiently serious on its merits, however, since the 
resulting rise of voltage increases directly with the current and 
may produce terrific results when the break comes as the result of a 
short circuit. Minor surging occurs when there is a sudden and 
violent change in the conditions of the circuit even without an actual 
break. Such a change produces an impulsive redistribution of 
energy that may give a sharp rise in voltage. Every point of abrupt 
variation in the electrical constants on the system is liable to be 
affected by minor surges. Such disturbances when trivial are 
commonly referred to as " static." Surging, depending as it does 
on the current ruptured, may, and indeed often does, give particularly 
formidable effects on circuits of moderate voltage, while on high 
voltage transmission circuits the usually moderate current and the 
large margin of safety in the insulation are important ameliorating 
influences. 

Maintenance. — Transmission lines are, when practicable, laid out 
through open country, and along roads which furnish^ easy access 
for inspection and repairs. The chief sources of danger in temperate 
climates are mechanical injury from the falling of branches 01 trees 
across the circuits, sleet and wind storms, and lightning. The first- 
mentioned difficulty may be avoided by keeping clear, so far as 
possible, of wooded country, and it should be remembered that, at 
the voltages customarily used for transmission, a twig the size of a 
lead-pencil falling across the wires may set up arcing, and it will 
end by burning the wires completely off — not directly by fusion, 
but by persistent arcing. A properly constructed overhead line is 
practically safe against all storms, save those of most extraordinary 
violence, and with care may be made secure even against these. 
As a matter of practice, interruptions of service upon transmission 
systems are very rarely due to trouble upon the main line itself, 
but are far more likely to occur in some part of the distributing 
system. The most dangerous combination of circumstances is a sleet 
storm sufficient to coat the wires with ice, followed by heavy winds; 
if the line, however, is constructed with proper factors of safety, 
bearing this particular danger in mind, there need be very little 
fear of serious results. Lightning is a much more formidable enemy. 
The lightning discharges observed upon electric circuits are of two 
general descriptions: first, a direct discharge of lightning upon the 
line, mure or less severe, and always to be dreaded; and secondly, 
induced discharges due to lightning flashes which do not hit the line, 
or to static disturbances which may or may not produce actual 
lightning. Discharges of the former class are vastly more severe 
than those of the latter, and, fortunately, are somewhat rare. They 
may actually shatter the line, or may distribute themselves along it 
for a considerable distance, leaping from wire to pole, and thence to 
earth, without actually damaging the line to any marked degree. 
The induced discharges are felt principally in the apparatus, causing 
many of the burn-outs observed in transformers and generators. 
There is no complete protection against the effects of lightning upon 
the apparatus. • Even the best lightning arresters are palliatives 
rather than preventives. If, however, a number of arresters are 
put in parallel, with reactance coils between them on the way 
towards the apparatus, the vast majority of lightning discharges, 
to whatever cause they may be due, will be deflected harmlessly 
to earth. Moreover, the apparatus itself has a considerable power 
of resistance, due to its high insulation. The ends of the line should 
be very thoroughly protected by such lightning arresters, and other 
points, such as prominent elevations along the line, should receive 
similar additional protection. In some cases a substantial steel-wire 
cable stretched along the tops of the poles several feet above the line 
wires and well grounded at frequent intervals has been found 
very advantageous. With the best protection at present available, 



lightning is not a serious menace to continuity of service, and the 
apparatus of the distributing system is far more difficult to protect 
than the main line and its apparatus. 

Sub-stations. — In most long-distance transmission work the trans- 
mission line itself terminates in a sub-station, which bears to the 
general distribution system precisely the same relations which are 
borne by a central electric supply station to its distributing lines. 
Such a sub-station should be treated, in fact, as a central station, 
receiving its electric energy from a distance instead of employing 
local generators driven by prime movers. The design of the sub- 
station, however, is somewhat different from that of the ordinary 
central station. The transmission lines terminate generally in a 
bank of reducing transformers, bringing the voltage from the 10,000 
or higher voltage employed upon the line to the 2000 or more 
generally used in the distribution. These transformers are usually 
large, and their magnitude should be determined by the same con- 
siderations which apply to determining the size of the units to be 
employed in a generating station. The general rule to be followed 
is that the separate units shall be of such sizcthat one of them may 
be dispensed with without serious inconvenience. In the case of 
transformers, the unit in two- or three-phase working is the bank of 
transformers, which must be used together. In Continental practice 
three-phase reducing transformers are frequently made to include 
all three phases in a single structure; this practice is less frequently 
followed in American plants, separate transformers being more often 
used in each phase. In this case, two or three transformers, accord- 
ing as the two- or three-phase system is used, constitute a single 
transformer unit in the sense just mentioned. If a change is to be 
made from three-phase line to two-phase distribution, the change 
is made by the appropriate vector connexion of the transformers. 
The full-load efficiency of large sub-station transformers is commonly 
97 to 98%. In any case, the sub-station is furnished with voltage 
regulating appliances, to enable the voltage upon the distribution 
lines to be held constant and uniform. These regulators are, in 
practice, transformers with a variable transformation ratio. This 
is obtained in divers ways — sometimes by changing the inductive 
relations of the primary and secondary coils, sometimes by 
changing the relative number of effective turns in primary and 
secondary. Sets of these inductive regulators enable the voltage 
to be controlled over a sufficiently wide range to secure uniform 
potential on the system, and with a degree of delicacy that 
obviates any undesirable changes in voltage. The regulation 
is usually manual, no automatic regulator yet having proved 
entirely satisfactory. In very large systems it is worth noting 
that the so-called " skin effect " in alternating current conductors 
may become conspicuous. In the transmission circuits them- 
selves the wires are, in practice, never large^ enough to produce 
any sensible difference in conductivity for continuous and for alter- 
nating currents. In the heavy omnibus-bars of a large sub-station 
this immunity may not be continued, but in such cases flat strips 
are frequently employed. If these are not more than, say, a centi- 
metre in thickness, the " skin effect " is practically insignificant for 
all frequencies used commercially. Not infrequently the sub-station 
also contains devices for the changing of alternating to continuous 
current, usually synchronous converters feeding either traction 
system or electric lighting mains. ^ Beyond these converters the 
system becomes an ordinary continuous-current system, and is 
treated as such. When very close regulation is necessary, motor- 
generators arc often preferred to synchronous converters. Series 
arc lighting from transmission circuits is a much more serious 
problem. At the present time two methods are in vogue: first, 
the operation of continuous-current series-arc machines by 
synchronous or induction motors driven from the transmission 
system; and, secondly, series alternating apparatus for feeding 
alternating arcs. This apparatus consists either of constant- 
current transformers with automatically moving secondaries, 
or of inductive regulators, also automatic in their action, 
supplemented by transformers to supply them with the necessarily 
rather high voltage employed for arc distribution. As between 
these two systems practice is at present divided; electrically, the 
alternating apparatus gives a rather higher real efficiency, but in- 
volves the use of alternating arcs, which are somewhat less efficient, 
watt for watt, as light producers than the continuous-current arcs. 
The apparatus, however, requires practically no care, while the arc 
machines, driven by motors, require the same amount of care as if 
they were driven by other power. Arc light transformers, however, 
are likely to have low power factors, hardly above 0-8 at full load, 
and rapidly falling off at lower loads. Synchronous rectifiers 
changing the alternating current into a unidirectional current, suit- 
able for use'with arc lights, have been employed with some^ success, 
but not to any considerable extent. They are satisfactory in avoid- 
ing the use of alternating currents in the arc, and consume but little 
energy in the transformation from one form of current to the other, 
but involve the use of static transformers automatically giving con- 
stant current, which are somewhat objectionable on the score, of low- 
power factor. Mercury rectifiers are now used rather extensively 
and give excellent results, although they are as yet of somewhat 
uncertain life, and, like the synchronous rectifiers, require special 
transformers when worked at constant current. In Continental 
practice arc lights are almost universally worked off constant

potential circuits, and hence the difficulties just considered are for 
the most part peculiar to American systems. 

Distances of Transmission. — The ultimate determining factor in 
the distance to which power can be commercially transmitted is 
the economic side of the transmission, the maximum distance being 
the maximum distance at which the transmission will pay.^ As a 
mere engineering feat the transmission of power to a distance 
of many hundred miles is perfectly feasible, and, judging from the 
data available, the phenomena encountered in increasing the length 
of lines have not been of such character as to cause any hesitation 
in going still farther, provided the increase is commercially feasible. 
In American practice, it is within the truth to say that nearly all 
transmissions of reasonable size (say a few hundred kilowatts) to 
distances of twenty miles, or less, are pretty certain to pay. At 
distances up to fifty miles, in a large proportion of cases power can 
be delivered at prices which will enable it to compete with power 
locally generated by steam. From fifty to one hundred miles (on a 
large scale — several thousand kilowatts) the chances for commercial 
success are still good. T,he larger the amount of power transmitted, 
the better on the whole is the commercial outlook. The longest 
one yet operated has already been noted, and may be regarded as a 
commercial success. In certain localities where the cost of fuel 
is extremely high, transmissions of several hundred miles may prove 
successful from a commercial as well as an engineering standpoint, 
but the growth of industry, which indicates the necessity for such a 
transmission, may go on until, through improved facilities of trans- 
port, the cost of fuel may be greatly lowered and the economic 
conditions entirely changed. Such a modification of the con- 
ditions sometimes takes place much more quickly than would be 
anticipated at first sight, so that when very long distance trans- 
missions are under consideration, the permanence of the conditions 
which will render them profitable should be a very serious subject 
of consideration. (L. Bl.) 

POWIS, EARLS AND MARQUESSES OF. Before the Norman 
Conquest the Welsh principality of Powis, comprising the 
county of Montgomery and part of the counties of Brecknock, 
Radnor, Shropshire, Merioneth and Denbigh, was subject to 
the princes of North Wales. Early in the 12th century it was 
divided into upper and lower Powis. In 1283 Owen ap Griffin, 
prince of upper Powis, formally resigned his princely title 
(nomen et circulum principatus) and his lands to the English 
king Edward I. at Shrewsbury, and received the lands again 
as an English barony. (See Montgomeryshire Collections, 1868, 
vol. i.). This barony of Powis passed through female inherit- 
ance to the family of Cherleton and in 1421 to that of Grey. 
It fell into abeyance in 1551. 

In 1 587 Sir Edward Herbert (d. 1 594), a younger son of William 
Herbert, earl of Pembroke, purchased some of the lands of the 
barony, including Red castle, afterwards Powis castle, near 
Welshpool, and in 1629 his son William (c. 1573-1656) was 
created Baron Powis. William's grandson, William, the 3rd 
baron (c. 16 20-1696), was created earl of Powis in 1674 and 
Viscount Montgomery and marquess of Powis in 1687. The 
recognized head of the Roman Catholic aristocracy in England, 
Powis was suspected of complicity in some of the popish plots 
and was imprisoned in the Tower of London from 1678 to 1684. 
He followed James II. into exile and was created duke of Powis 
by the dethroned king. The English government deprived 
him of his estates, but these were restored to his son William, the 
2nd marquess, in 1722. William, who had a somewhat chequered 
career as a Jacobite, died in October 1745, and when his son 
William, the 3rd marquess, died in 1748 the titles became 
extinct. 

In 1748 Henry Arthur Herbert (d. 1772), who had been made 
Baron Herbert of Chirbury in 1743, was created Baron Powis 
and earl of Powis. He allied himself with the earlier holders 
of these titles, with which family he was distantly connected, 
by marrying Barbara, a niece of the 3rd marquess. The titles 
became extinct a second time when his son George Edward 
died in January 1801. George's sister and heiress, Henrietta 
Antonia (1758-1830), married Edward Clive (1754-1829), son 
and heir of the great Lord Clive. In 1794 he was made Baron 
Clive of Walcot, and in 1804, after serving as governor of Madras 
from 1798 to 1803, he was created Baron Powis and earl of Powis. 
His son Edward, the 2nd earl (1785-1848), took the name of 
Herbert in 1807 in lieu of that of Clive. He was a member of 
parliament from 1806 to 1839, and was elected in opposition 
to the Prince Consort, as chancellor of the university of 



Cambridge in 1847. His second son was Lieut. -General 
Sir Percy Egerton Herbert (1822-1876), who distinguished him- 
self in the Crimean War, and Sir Percy's son, George Ckarles 
(b. 1862), became the 4th earl in 1891. 

POWNALL, THOMAS (1722-1S05), British colonial states- 
man and soldier, was born at Saltfleetby, Lincolnshire, Eng- 
land, in 1722. He was educated at Lincoln and at Trinity 
College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1743. He entered 
the office of the lords commissioners of trade and plantations, 
of which his brother John was then secretary; and in 1753 he 
went to America as private secretary to Sir Danvers Osborn, 
just appointed governor of New York. Osborn committed 
suicide soon after reaching New York (Oct. 6), but Pownall 
remained in America, devoting himself to studying the con- 
dition of the American colonies. At the Albany Congress, in 
1754, he met Benjamin Franklin, and a life-long friendship 
between the two resulted. In 1756 he returned to England, 
and presented to Pitt a plan for a campaign against the French 
in Canada, to begin with the investment of Quebec. In 1757 
Pitt appointed him governor of Massachusetts, 1 in which office 
he heartily supported Pitt's policy during the Seven Years' 
War, and in 1758 encouraged the equipment of a force of 7000 
men, to be recruited and armed in New England; but the French 
power in America once broken, Pownall came more directly 
under the influence of the lords of trade, and his unwillingness 
to carry out the repressive policies of that body caused his 
transfer to the governorship of South Carolina in February 1760. 
This office he held nominally for about a year; but he never 
went to South Carolina, and in June 1760 he returned to Eng- 
land. In 1 762-1 763 he was commissary-general of the British 
troops in Germany. As member of parliament for Tregony in 
1 768-1 7 74 and for Minehead in 17 74-1 780, he at first sided 
with the Whigs in opposing all plans to tax the American 
colonists, but he supported North's administration after the 
outbreak of the War of Independence. He died at Bath 
on the 25th of February 1805. In 1764 he published (at first 
anonymously) his famous Administration of the Colonies (other 
editions appeared in 1765, 1766, 1768 and 1774), in which he 
advocated a union of all British possessions upon the basis of 
community of commercial interests. 

For an extended account of Pownall's career and a bibliography 
of his publications see Thomas Pownall, M.P., F.R.S, (London, 
1908), by Charles A. W. Pownall, a distant .kinsman, who attempts 
to prove that Pownall was the " author behind the scenes " of the 
" Letters of Junius " and " that Francis was his subordinate." 

POYET, GUILLAUME (1473-1548), French magistrate, was 
born at Angers. After practising successfully as a barrister 
at Angers and Paris, he was instructed by Louise of Savoy, 
mother of the king, Francis I., to uphold her rights against 
the constable de Bourbon in 1521. This was the beginning 
of his fortunes. Through the influence of the queen-mother 
he obtained the posts of advocate-general (1530) and president 
of the parlement of Paris (1534), and became chancellor of 
France in 1 538. He was responsible for the legal reform con- 
tained in the ordinance of Villers-Cotterets (1539), the object 
of which was to shorten procedure. This ordered the keeping 
of registers of baptisms and deaths, and enjoined the exclusive 
use of the French language in legal procedure. With the con- 
stable de Montmorency he organized an intrigue to rain Admiral 
Chabot, and procured his condemnation in 1541; but after the 
admiral was pardoned, Poyet was himself thrown into prison, 
deprived of his offices, and sentenced to a fine of 100,000 livres. 
He recovered his liberty in 1545, and died in April 1548.

POYNINGS, SIR EDWARD (1450-1521), lord deputy of Ire- 
land, was the only son of Robert Poynings, second son of the 
5th Baron Poynings. His mother was a daughter of Sir William 
Paston, and some of her correspondence is to be found in the 

1 In September 1755 Pownall had been made lieutenant-governor 
of New Jersey, but he had little to do with the affairs of that province 
and resigned soon after his appointment to Massachusetts.

Paston Letters. Robert Poynings was implicated in Jack Cade's 
rebellion, and Edward was himself concerned in a Kentish 
rising against Richard III., which compelled him to escape to 
the Continent. He attached himself to Henry, earl of Rich- 
mond, afterwards King Henry VII., with whom he returned to 
England in 1485. By Henry VII. Poynings was employed 
in the wars on the Continent, and in 1493 he was made governor 
of Calais. In the following year he went to Ireland as lord 
deputy under the viceroyalty of Pnnce Henry, afterwards King 
Henry VIII. Poynings immediately set about Anglicizing the 
government of Ireland, which he thoroughly accomplished, 
after inflicting punishment on the powerful Irish clans who 
supported the imposture of Perkin Warbeck. He then sum- 
moned the celebrated parliament of Drogheda, which met in 
December 1494, and enacted the " Statutes of Drogheda," 
famous in Irish history as " Poynings's law" (see Statute: 
Ireland), which made the Irish legislature subordinate to, and 
completely dependent on t that of England, till its repeal in 1782. 
After defeating Perkin Warbeck at Waterford and driving him 
out of Ireland, Poynings returned to England in 1496, and was 
appointed warden of the Cinque Ports. He was employed both 
in military commands and in diplomatic missions abroad by 
Henry VII., and later by Henry VIII., his most important 
achievement being the successful negotiation of the " holy 
league " between England, Spain, the emperor, and the pope, 
in 1 5 13. In 1520 he was present at the Field of the Cloth 
of Gold, in the arrangement of which he had taken an active part. 
He died in 1521. By his wife, Elizabeth Scot, Poynings left 
no surviving issue, and his estates passed through a collateral 
female line to the earl of Northumberland. He had several 
illegitimate children, one of whom, Thomas Poynings, was 
created Baron Poynings in 1545, but died in the same year 
without heirs.

POYNTER, SIR EDWARD JOHN, Bart. (1836- ), English 
painter, son of Ambrose Poynter, architect, was born in Paris 
on the 20th of March 1836. He pursued his art studies in 
England and in Paris (under Gleyre, 1 856-1859), and exhibited 
his first picture at the Royal Academy in 186 1. In 1869, after 
the exhibition of " Israel in Egypt " and " The Catapult," he 
was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1876, 
the year of " Atalanta's Race," full Academician. 

In the decorative arts he practised freely as a designer in fresco, 
mosaic, stained glass, pottery, tile-work and the like. While still 
quite a young man, he was encouraged by the architect William 
Burgcs, A.R.A., to design panels for his quaint Gothic cabinets; 
Messrs Powell obtained from him cartoons of designs for stained 
glass; for the decoration of Waltham Abbey church he was employed 
on a series of thirty important designs. Attracted by these, Dalziel 
Brothers commissioned a number of full-page drawings on wood 
for the illustration of their celebrated " Bible Gallery. * The car- 
toons for " St George " and " St David," the mosaic panels now 
embellishing the outer lobby of the Palace of Westminster, were 
produced in 1870, and they were followed by the " Applies " and 

Phidias," in the same method of reproduction, in the Victoria and 
Albert Museum; by the important series of frescoes in St Stephen's, 
Dulwich — scenes from the life of the saint; by the decorationof the 
grill room at the M uscum at South Kensington, with the tiles en 
cama'ieu — an achievement strikingly successful and pregnant with 
results. Always a lover of water-colour drawing and of the art 
of landscape painting, he was elected to the Royal Society of Painters 
in Water Colours in 1883. In 1874 he designed the Ashantee medal; 
and in 1892, for the coinage of that year, the reverse of the shilling 
and florin, to the obverse of Mr Thomas Brock, R.A. 

When the art teaching centre of South Kensington was 
assuming the importance it has since attained, Mr Poynter was 
appointed director for art in the Science and Art Department, 
and principal of the National Art Training Schools (now the 
Royal College of Art), and by virtue of his vigorous and 
successful administration he invested his office with a distinction 
which, after his resignation in 1881, it soon notoriously lacked. 



The directorship of the National Gallery became vacant in 
1894, and Poynter, profoundly versed in the works of the Old 
Masters, especially of the Italian schools, was appointed to the 
post, which he held for ten years. Under his rule the National 
Gallery of British Art, at Millbank, presented by the late Sir 
Henry Tate, became a department of the National Gallery, and 
thither were removed many pictures formerly in the British 
rooms at Trafalgar Square, as well as the Chantrey Collection 
from South Kensington, &c. One of the most important services 
by the director was the editing of the great Illustrated Catalogue 
of the National Gallery (1889-1900), in which every picture in 
the collection is reproduced— an unprecedented achievement in 
the annals of art-publishing. 

On the death of Sir John Millais in 1896, Poynter was elected 
to the presidency of the Royal Academy, and was knighted. 
He was made a baronet in 1902. 

Paintings. — Among Sir Edward Poynter's most notable pictures 
have been the following: " Israel in Egypt " (1867); " The 
Catapult " (1868); " Perseus and Andromeda u (1872); " Atalanta's 
Race " (1876); " The Fortune-Teller " (1877); " Nausicaa and Her 
Maidens " (1879); " Visit to Aesculapius " (1880), now in the Chan- 
trey Collection in the Tate Gallery; " The Ides of March " (1883); 
" Diadumcne " (1885), now destroyed; " On the Terrace " (1889); 
" The Meeting of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba " (1891) ; " Horae 
Serenae " and " Idle Fears " (1894), and numerous portraits and 
water-colour drawings. 

Lectures. — In his series of Slade Lectures, delivered from 1875 to 
1879, and first published in 1870 (republished, with additions, in 
1897), Sir Edward Poynter deals with the whole subject of art 
education, considering in turn Decorative Art, Old and New Art, 
Systems of Art Education, Hints on the Formation of a Style, 
Training of Art Students, The Study of Nature, The Value of Things, 
Objects of Study, Professor Ruskin on Michelangelo (hotly con- 
troversial in tone), Influence of Art in Social Life, and Ancient 
Decorative Art.

POZHAREVATS (also written Passarowitz and Pozarevac), 
a town in Servia, situated in the Morava valley, 4 m. E. of the 
Morava river and 8 m. S. of the Danube. The station for 
steamers, Dubravitsa, with its custom-house, standing on the 
banks of the Danube, forms practically the harbour of Pozhare- 
vats. The town has no special industry, but is the principal 
market of a very extensive and fruitful plain between the 
rivers Morava, Mlava and Danube. It is the capital of a depart- 
ment bearing the same name, and the seat of a prefecture, a 
tribunal of justice, a college and several national or normal 
schools. It has a large modern penitentiary, with a department 
for political offenders and a prison for women. Two miles to the 
west, towards Morava, is situated Lubichevo, a model farm and 
stud belonging to the government. The shady park and flower 
gardens are a popular resort of the people of Pozharevats. The 
town is known in the history of international treaties as the place 
at which the famous peace of Passarowitz between Austria and 
Turkey was concluded in 17 18. Pop. (1900), 12,957. 

Lignite is worked at Kostolats, 7 m. N. by E., and the hills 
between Pozharevats and Kostolats show many traces of Roman 
mines. A number of coins, sarcophagi and inscriptions found 
in the neighbourhood are also Roman. 

POZOBLANCO, a town of southern Spain in the province of 
Cordova, near the head-waters of the Guadamatillas and of other 
small sub-tributaries of the Guadiana. Pop. (1900), 12,792. 
Pozoblanco is one of the chief towns in the lowlands of Los 
Pedroches, which lie between the Sierra de la Alcudia on the 
north and the Sierra Morena on the south. Although there is 
no railway in the district, Pozoblanco has a thriving trade. Its 
fairs are famed for their exhibits of live stock and agricultural 
products. There are zinc and argentiferous lead mines in the 
neighbourhood, and manufactures of cloth and leather in the 
town itself. 

POZZO DI BORGO, CARLO ANDREA, Count (1764-1842), 
Russian diplomatist, was born at Alata, near Ajaccio, of a 
noble Corsican family, on the 8th of March 1764, some four years 
before the cession of the island to France. He was educated

POZZUOLI— PRAED 



at Pisa, and in early life was closely associated with Napoleon 
and Joseph Bonaparte, the two families being at that time 
closely allied in politics. Pozzo was one of the two delegates 
sent to the National Assembly in Paris to demand the political 
incorporation of Corsica in France, and was subsequently one 
of the Corsican deputies to the Legislative Assembly, where he 
sat on the benches of the right until the events of August 1792. 
On his safe return to Corsica he was warmly received by Paoli, 
but found himself in opposition to the Bonaparte brothers, who 
were now veering to the Jacobin party. Under the new con- 
stitution Pozzo was elected procureur-ge'ntral-syndic, that is, 
chief of the civil government, while Paoli commanded the army. 
With Paoli he refused to obey a summons to the bar of the 
Convention, and the definite breach with the Bonaparte family, 
who actively supported the revolutionary authorities, dates 
from this time. Eventually Paoli and Pozzo accepted 
foreign help, and from 1794 to 1796, during the English pro- 
tectorate of Corsica, Pozzo was president of the council of state 
under Sir Gilbert Elliot. When Napoleon sent troops to occupy 
the island he was excepted from the general amnesty, and took 
refuge in Rome, but the French authorities demanded his ex- 
pulsion, and gave orders for his arrest in northern Italy. After 
a short stay in London he accompanied in 1798 Sir Gilbert 
Elliot (now become Lord Minto) on an embassy to Vienna, where 
he lived for six years and was well received in political circles. 
Hatred of Napoleon was his dominant passion, and even as an 
exile of no official standing he was recognized as a dangerous 
enemy. In 1804 through the influence of Prince Adam Czar- 
toryski he entered the Russian diplomatic service, and was em- 
ployed in 1805 as Russian commissioner with the Anglo-Neapoli- 
tan, and in 1806 with the Prussian army. He was entrusted 
with an important mission to Constantinople in 1807, but the 
conclusion of the alliance between Alexander I. and Napoleon 
at Tilsit in July interrupted his career, necessitating a tem- 
porary retirement after the completion of his business with the 
Porte. He returned to Vienna, but on the demand of Napoleon 
for his extradition Metternich desired him to leave the capital. 
In London, where he found safety from Napoleon, he renewed 
many old ties, and remained in England until 181 2, when he 
was recalled by Alexander. He diligently sought "to sow dis- 
sension in the Bonaparte household, and in a mission to Sweden 
he secured the co-operation of Bernadotte against Napoleon. 
On the entry of the allies into Paris he became commissary 
general to the provisional government. At the Bourbon restora- 
tion General Pozzo di Borgo became Russian ambassador at 
the Tuileries, and sought to secure a marriage between the duke 
of Berry and the Russian grandduchess Anna, Alexander's 
sister. He assisted at the Congress of Vienna, and during the 
Hundred Days he joined Louis XVIII. in Belgium, where he 
was also instructed to discuss the situation with Wellington, 
The tsar dreamed of allowing an appeal to the people of France 
on the subject of the government of France in accordance with 
his vague liberalizing tendencies, but Pozzo's suggestions in 
this direction were met by violent opposition, the duke refusing 
to make any concessions to what he regarded as rebellion; but 
in Petersburg, on the other hand, his attachment to the Bourbon 
dynasty was considered excessive. During the early years 
of his residence in Paris Pozzo laboured tirelessly to lessen the 
burdens laid on France by the allies and to shorten the period of 
foreign occupation. That his French sympathies were re- 
cognized in Paris is shown by the strange suggestion that he 
should enter the French ministry with the portfolio of foreign 
affairs. He consistently supported the moderate* party at 
court, and stood by the ministry of the due de Richelieu, thus 
earning the distrust and dislike of Metternich, who held him 
responsible for the revival of Liberal agitation in France. His 
influence at the Tuileries declined with the accession of 
Charles X., whose reactionary tendencies had always been dis- 
tasteful to him; but at the revolution of 1830, when the Tsar 
Nicholas was reluctant to acknowledge Louis Philippe, he did 
good service in preventing difficulties with Russia. In 1832 he 
visited Petersburg; the next year he was in London renewing 



his relations with Wellington, and early in 1835 he was sud- 
denly transferred to the London embassy in succession to Prince 
Lieven. Although he did not lose in official standing, Pozzo 
was aware that this change was due to suspicions long har- 
boured in various quarters in St Petersburg that his diplomacy 
was too favourable to French interests. In London his health 
suffered, and he retired from the service in 1839 to spend the 
rest of his days in Paris, where he died on the 15th of February 
1842. He had been made a count and peer of France in 1818.

POZZUOLI (anc. Puleoli, q.v.), a seaport and episcopal 
see of Campania, Italy, in the province of Naples, i\ m. W. of 
it by rail. Pop. (1906), 17,017 (town); 22,838 (commune). 
It is situated on and at the base of a hill projecting into the bay 
at Pozzuoli, separated from the main portion of the Gulf of 
Naples by the promontory of Posilipo. Its mineral baths are 
frequented in summer; and the volcanic pozzolana earth (also 
found near Rome), used now as in Roman times for making 
cement and concrete, derives its name from the place. In the 
middle ages Pozzuoli was frequently sacked and also damaged 
by the natural convulsions of 11 98 and 1538. To the north- 
east of the town is the Solfatura, a half extinct volcano crater, 
in which sulphurous gases are exhaled. 

PRABHU, the writer caste of Western India, corresponding to

executive council at Bombay was a Prabhu, of the well-known 
Chaubal family. 

PRADIER, JAMES (1792-1862), French sculptor, was born 
at Geneva. He was a member of the French Academy, and a 
popular sculptor of the pre-Romantic period, representing in 
France the drawing-room classicism which Canova illustrated 
at Rome. His chief works are the Niobe group (1822), "Ata- 
lanta" (1850), "Psyche" (1824), "Sappho" (1852) (all io 
the Louvre), " Prometheus " (Tuileries Gardens), a bas-relief 
on the triumphal arch of the Carrousel, the figures of " Fame " 
on the Arc de Tfitoile, and a statue of J. J. Rousseau for Geneva. 
Besides these mention should be made of his "'Three Graces " 
(1821). 

PRADILLA, FRANCISCO (1847- )> Spanish painter, was 
born at Villanueva da Gallago (Saragossa). Having studied 
first at the Fernando Academy, and then at the Spanish Academy 
in Rome, of which he was afterwards director, he became the 
leading historical painter of modern Spain. In 1896 he was 
appointed director of the Madrid Museum. Though he is best 
known for such large historical compositions as "Joan the Mad" 
(gold medal, Paris, 1878), and " The Surrender of Granada " 
(gold medal, Munich, 1883), in which he discarded the heavy 
colouring of Laurens for a lighter and more atmospheric key, 
he has painted many excellent genre pictures in the manner of 
Fortuny, and some decorative compositions in which he follows 
the example of Tiepolo. The best of these are his decorations 
in the Murgo Palaee in Madrid. Among his best known works 
are " Elopement," " Strand at Vigo," " Procession in Venice," 
"La Fiorella," "Reading on the Balcony," "Don Alfonso 
the Warrior," and " Don Alfonso the Scholar." He became 
member of the Berlin Academy in 1892. 

PRAED, WINTHROP MACKWORTH (1802-1839), English 
poet, was born in London on the 26th of July 1802. The old 
family name was Mack worth, the additional name of Praed 
being derived from the marriage of the poet's great grand- 
father with a Cornish heiress. His father, William Mackworth 
Praed, was a serjeant-at-law. His mother belonged to the 
English branch of the New England family of Winthrop. In 
1814 Praed was sent to Eton College. He there founded a 
manuscript periodical called Apis matina. This was suc- 
ceeded in October 1820 by the Etonian, a paper projected and 



PRAEFECT 



241 



edited by Praed and Walter Blount, which appeared every 
month until July 1821, when the chief editor, who signed his 
contributions " Peregrine Courtcnay," left Eton, and the paper 
died. Henry Nelson Coleridge, William Sidney Walker, and 
John Moultrie were the three best known of his coadjutors in 
this periodical, which was published by Charles Knight, and 
of which many interesting particulars are given in Knight's 
A utobiography and in Maxwell Ly te's Eton College. Before Praed 
left school he succeeded in establishing over a shop at Eton a 
" boys' library/' the books of which are now amalgamated in 
the School Library. His career at Cambridge, where he matricu- 
lated at Trinity College, October 182 1, was marked by excep- 
tional briUiancy. He gained the Browne medal for Greek 
verse four times, and twice the chancellor's medal for English 
verse. He was bracketed third in the classical tripos in 1825, 
won a fellowship at his college in 1827, and three years later 
carried off the Seatonian prize. At the Union his speeches were 
only rivalled by those of Macaulay and of Charles Austin (1700- 
1874), who subsequently made a great reputation at the par- 
liamentary bar. The character of Praed during his university 
life is described by Bulwer Lytton in the first volume of his 
Life. He began to study law, and in 1829 was called to the bar 
at the Middle Temple. He went the Norfolk circuit, where 
his prospects of advancement were bright, but the bias of his 
feelings inclined him towards politics, and after a year or two 
he devoted himself entirely to political life. Whilst at Cam- 
bridge he leaned to Whiggism, and even to the autumn of 1829 
his feelings were bent towards the same side, but during the 
agitation for parliamentary reform his opinions changed, and 
when he was returned to parliament for St Germans (Dec. 
17, 1830) his election was due to the Tory party. He sat 
for that borough until December 1832, and on its extinction 
contested the borough of St Ives, within the limits of which the 
Cornish estates of the Praeds were situated. The squibs which 
he wrote on this occasion were collected in a volume printed at 
Penzance in 1833 and entitled Trash , dedicated without respect 
to James Halse, Esq., M.P., his successful competitor. Praed 
sat for Great Yarmouth from 1835 to 1837, and was secretary 
to the Board of Control during Sir Robert Peel's short adminis- 
tration. He sat for Aylesbury from 1837 until his death. 
During the progress of the Reform Bill he advocated the creation 
of three-cornered constituencies, in which each voter should 
have the power of giving two votes only, and maintained that 
freeholds within boroughs should confer votes for the boroughs 
and not for the county. Neither of these suggestions was then 
adopted, but the former ultimately formed part of the Reform 
Bill of 1866. He married in 1835 Helen Bogle. He died of 
consumption at Chester Square, London, on the 15th of July 

1839. 

Praed's lighter poetry was the perfection of ease. Mr Austin 
Dobson has justly praised his " sparkling wit, the clearness 
and finish of his style, and the flexibility and unflagging 
vivacity of his rhythm " (Ward's English Poets). It abounded 
in happy allusions to the characters and follies of the day. In 
his humorous effusions he found numerous imitators. 

His poems were first edited by R. W. Griswold (New York, 1844) ; 
another American edition, by \V. A. Whitmore, appeared in 1859; 
an authorized edition with a memoir by Derwent Coleridge appeared 
in 1864: The Political and Occasional Poems of W. Af. Praed (1888), 
edited with notes by his nephew, Sir George Young, included many 
pieces collected from various newspapers and periodicals. Sir 
George Young separated from his work some poems, the work of his 
friend Edward Marlborough Fitzgerald, generally confused with his. 
Praed 's essays, contributed to various magazines, were published in 
Morley's Universal Library in 1887. 

PRAEFECT (praefecttis), the title of various Roman officials, 
both civil and military. A praefect was not one of the magis- 
trates proper; he was, strictly speaking, only the deputy or 
lieutenant of a superior magistrate or commander. The fol- 
lowing were the most important. 

1. The city praefect (praefectus urbis) acted at Rome as the 
deputy of the chief magistrate or magistrates during his or 
their absence Irom the city. Thus he represented in the earliest 



times the king and in later times the consul or consuls when 
he or they were absent on a campaign or on other public duties, 
such as the celebration of the annual Latin festival on the Alban 
Mount. The absence of the chief magistrate for more than a 
single day rendered the appointment of a praefect obligatory; 
but the obligation only arose when all the higher magistrates 
were absent. Hence so long as the consuls were the only higher 
magistrates their frequent absence often rendered the appoint- 
ment of a praefect necessary, but after the institution of the 
practorship (367 B.C.) the necessity only arose exceptionally, 
as it rarely happened that both the consuls and the praetor 
were absent simultaneously. But a- praefect continued to be 
regularly appointed, even under the empire, during Pr&cte&uM 
the enforced absence of all the higher magistrates Urbis 
at the Latin festival. The right and duty of appoint- Feriarum 
ing a praefect belonged to the magistrate (king, LmUn * rum * 
dictator or consul) whose deputy he was, but it seems to have 
been withdrawn from the consuls by the Licinian law (367), 
except that they still nominated praefects for the time of the 
festival. No formalities in the appointment and no legal 
qualifications on the part of the praefect were required. The 
praefect had all the powers of the magistrate whose deputy 
he was, except that he could not nominate a deputy to him- 
self. His office expired on the return of his superior. There 
could only be one city praefect at a time, though the dictator 
Caesar broke the rule by appointing six or eight praefects 
simultaneously. 

Under the empire there was introduced a city prefecture 
which differed essentially from the above. Augustus occa- 
sionally appointed a city praefect to represent him in his absence 
from Italy, although the praetors, or even one of the consuls, 
remained in the capital. In the absence of Tiberius from Rome 
during the last eleven years of his reign (a.d. 26-37) the city 
prefecture, hitherto an exceptional and temporary office, be- 
came a regular and permanent magistracy; in all subsequent 
reigns the praefect beld office even during the presence of the 
emperor in Rome. He was always chosen by the emperor and 
usually from men who had held the consulship; his office was 
regarded, like the censorship under the republic, as the crown- 
ing honour of a long political career. It was not conferred for 
any definite length of time, but might be held for years or for 
life.' As under the republic, the praefect was not allowed to 
quit the city for more than a day at a time. His duty was the 
preservation of peace in the capital; he was, in fact, the chief 
of the police, being charged with the superintendence pf the 
streets, markets and public buildings. He was further entrusted 
by Augustus with a summary criminal jurisdiction over slaves 
and rioters, which was, however, gradually extended till in the 
time of Severus or even earlier it embraced all offences by 
whomsoever committed. Further, he had the power of dealing 
with civil cases where his interference seemed requisite in the 
interests of the public safety, but such occasions were naturally 
few. By the beginning of the 3rd century, and perhaps earlier, 
appeals to the emperor in civil cases were handed over by him 
to be dealt with by the praefect. Except where special re- 
strictions interfered, an appeal lay from the praefect to the 
emperor. Though, not a military officer, the praefect com- 
manded the city cohorts (colwrtes urbanae), which formed part 
of the garrison of Rome and ranked above the line regiments, 
though below the guards (see Praetorians). The military 
power thus placed in the hands of the chief of the police was one 
of the most sorely-felt innovations of the empire. The con- 
stitutional changes of Diocletian and Constantine extended 
still further the power of the praefect, in whom, after the dis- 
banding of the guards and the removal from Rome of the highest 
officials, the whole military, administrative and judicial powers 
were centred. 

2. Under the republic judicial praefects (praefect i jure dicendo) 
were sent annually from Rome as deputies of the praetors 
to administer justice in certain towns of the Italian allies. 
These towns were called prefectures (praefecturae). After the 
Social War (90-89 B.C.), when all Italy had received the Roman 



242 



PRAEMUNIRE 



franchise, such prefectures ceased to exist in fact, though the 
name was sometimes retained. 

3. Under the empire the praetorians or imperial guards were 
commanded by one, two, or even three praefects (praefecli 
praetorio), who were chosen by the emperor from among the 
knights and held office at his pleasure. From the time of Alex- 
ander Severus the post was open to senators also, and if a knight 
was appointed he was at the same time raised to the senate. 
Down to the time of Constantine, who deprived the office of 
its military character, the prefecture of the guards was regu- 
larly held by tried soldiers, often by men who had fought their 
way up from the ranks. In course of time the command seems 
to have been enlarged so as to include all the troops in Italy 
except the corps commanded by the city praefect (cohorles 
urbanae). Further, the praetorian praefect acquired, in addition 
to his military functions, a criminal jurisdiction, which he 
exercised not as the delegate but as the representative of the 
emperor, and hence it was decreed by Constantine (331) that 
from the sentence of the praetorian praefect there should he no 
appeal. A similar jurisdiction in civil cases was acquired by 
him not later than the time of Severus. Hence a knowledge 
of law became a qualification for the post, which under Marcus 
Antoninus and Com modus, but especially from the time of 
Severus, was held by the first jurists of the age, (e.g. Papinian, 
Ulpian and Paullus), while the military qualification fell more 
and more into the background. Under Constantine the insti- 
tution of the magistri militum deprived the praetorian pre- 
fecture altogether of its military character, but left it the 
highest civil office of the empire. 

The title of " praefect " was borne by various other Roman officials, 
of whom we may mention the following: — 

4. Praefectus Socium (sociorum). — Under the republic the con- 
tingents furnished to the Roman armies by the Italian allies were 
commanded by Roman officers called praefecti socium (sociorum) , 
who were nominated by the consuls and corresponded to the 
tribunes in the legions. 

5. Praefectus Classium. — Down to near the close of the republic a 
naval command was never held independently but only in connexion 
with the command of an army, and, when the general appointed 
an officer to command the fleet in his room, this lieutenant was 
styled " praefect of the fleet " (praefectus classium). When in 31 1 B.C. 
the people took the appointment of these lieutenants into their 
own hands the title was changed from " praefects " to duo viri 
navales, or ''two naval men"; but under the empire the admirals 
went by their old name of praefects. 

6. Praefectus Fabrutn. — The colonel of the engineer and artillery 
corps (fabri) in a Roman army was called a praefect; he did not 
belong to the legion, but was directly subordinate to the general in 
command. 

7. Praefectus Annonae. — The important duty of provisioning 
Rome was committed by Augustus (between a.d. 8 and 14) to a 
praefect, who was appointed by the emperor from among the knights 
and held office at the imperial pleasure. 

8. Praefectus Aegypti (afterwards Praefectus augustalis). — Under 
the empire the government of Egypt was entrusted to a viceroy 
with the title of " praefect/' who was selected from the knights, and 
was surrounded by royal pomp instead of the usual insignia of a 
Roman magistrate. He stood under the immediate orders of the 
emperor. The exceptional position thus accorded to Egypt was 
due to a regard on the part of the emperors to the peculiar character 
of the population, the strategic strength of the country, and its 
political importance as the granary of Rome. (J. G. Fr.) 

9. Praefectus Castrorum, from the time of Augustus to Severus the 
title of the commander of the fixed camps of the legions in different 
parts of the empire. He was a purely military man appointed by 
the emperor, usually a centurion whose term of service was com- 
pleted. From the time of Domitian, when each legion had a separate 
camp, the name of the legion was added to the title, e.g. praefectus 
castrorum legionis xiii. gem. (C.I.L. iii. 454). The duties of this 
officer included: the arrangement of the camp and medical service, 
the transport of the baggage, the construction of roads, bridges and 
fortifications, the supply of ammunition and engines of war. 

10. Praefectus Vigilum, the commander of the seven cohortes 
vigilum, a night police force instituted by Augustus (a.d. 6). To 
each cohort, consisting of about 1000 men (chiefly freedmen), was 
entrusted the care of two of the fourteen city districts; one of its 
chief duties was that of a fire brigade. The policing of the city had 
formerly been one of the duties of the aediles, but was now trans- 
ferred to the praefectus vigilum, appointed by the emperor from the 
equites. He exercised criminal jurisdiction in cases of incendiarism 
and offences committed against the law during the night, and in 
later times this jurisdiction was considerably extended. 



The different kinds of praefects are fully discussed in Mommsen, 
Romisches Staatsrecht (1887) vols, ii., iii.; see also T. M. Taylor, Con- 
stitutional and Political History of Rome ( 1 899) . There is an excellent 
monograph on the Praefectura urbis by P. E. Vigneaux (1896). 
Mommsen deals very cursorily with the praefectus castrorum, but 
there is a special article by G. Wilmanns, in Ephemeris epigraphica 
(1872), vol. i.," De praefecto castrorum et praefecto legionis." 

For the French prefet see Prefect. (X.) 

PRAEMUNIRE (Lat. praemonere, to pre-admonish or fore- 
warn), in English law an offence so called from the introductory 
words of the writ of summons issued to the defendant to answer 
the charge, " Praemunire facias A.B,.," &c, i.e. " cause A.B. 
to be forewarned." From this the word came to be used to 
denote the offences, usually ecclesiastical, prosecuted by means 
of such a writ, and also the penalties they incurred. The statute 
of Richard II., Purchasing bulls from Rome (1392), is usually 
designated the Statute of Praemunire, but it is only one of 
numerous stringent measures (some still unrepealed, and, as 
a body, of the most confused character) passed for the pur- 
pose of putting restraint on the papal usurpation of authority 
in England. From the beginning of the 14th century papal 
aggression had been particularly active, more especially in two 
forms. The one, the disposal of ecclesiastical benefices, before 
the same became vacant, to men of the. pope's own choosing; 
the other, the encouragement of resort to himself and his curia 
rather than to the courts of the country. The Statute of 
Pro visors 1306, passed in the reign of Edward I., was, according 
to Coke, the foundation of all subsequent statutes of praemunire. 
This statute enacted " that no tax imposed by any religious 
persons should be sent out of the country whether under the 
name of a rent, tallage, tribute or any kind of imposition." A 
much greater check on the freedom of action of the popes was 
imposed by the Statute of Provisors (1350-1351) and the Statute 
of Praemunire passed in the reign of Edward III. The former 
of these, after premising "that the Pope of Rome, accroaching 
to him the seignories of possession and benefices of the holy 
Church of the realm of England doth give and grant the same 
benefices to aliens which did never dwell in England, and to 
cardinals, which might not dwell here, and to others as well 
aliens as denizens, as if he had been patron or advowee of the 
said dignities and benefices, as he was not of right by the laws 
of England . . . ," ordained the free election of all dignities 
and benefices elective in the manner as they were granted by 
the king's progenitors. The Statute of Praemunire (the first 
statute so called) 1353, though expressly levelled at the pre- 
tensions of the Roman curia, excludes any direct reference to 
it in actual words. By it, the king " at the grievous and clam- 
orous complaints of the great men and commons of the realm 
of England " enacts " that all the people of the king's ligeance 
of what condition that they be, which shall draw any out of the 
realm in plea " or any matter of which the cognizance properly 
belongs to the king's court shall be allowed two months in which 
to answer for their contempt of the king's rights in transferring 
their pleas abroad. The penalties which were attached to the 
offence under this statute involved the loss of all civil rights, 
forfeiture of lands, goods and chattels, and imprisonment 
during the royal pleasure. 

Many other statutes followed that of 1353, but that passed in 
the sixteenth year of Richard II. 's reign is, as mentioned before, 
usually referred to as the Statute of Praemunire. This statute, 
after first stating " that the right of recovering the present- 
ments to churches, prebends, and other benefices . . . be- 
longeth only to the king's court of the old right of his crown, 
used and approved in the time of all his progenitors kings of 
England," proceeds to condemn the practice of papal trans- 
lation, and after rehearsing the promise of the three estates 
of the realm to stand with the king in all cases touching his 
crown and his regalty, enacts " that if any purchase or pursue, 
or cause to be purchased or pursued in the court of Rome, or 
elsewhere, any such translations, processes, and sentences of 
excommunications, hulls, instruments or any other things what- 
soever ... he and his notaries, abettors and counsellors " 
shall be put out of the king's protection, and their lands, 



PRAENESTE 



243 



tenements, goods and chattels forfeit to the king, and they shall 
be attached by their bodies or process made against them by 
praemunire facias. This statute, says Stubbs, was one of the 
strongest defensive measures taken during the middle ages 
against Rome and was called for by the conduct of the pope, 
who had forbidden the bishops to execute the sentences of the 
royal courts in suits connected with ecclesiastical patronage. 
The last ancient statute concerning praemunire, until the Refor- 
mation, was an extension in the reign of Henry IV. (1400) of 
the Statute of Provisors, by which all persons who accepted any 
provision from the pope to be exempt from canonical obedience 
to their proper ordinary were subjected to the penalties pre- 
scribed. The range and description of offences subject to the 
penalties of praemunire were greatly widened after the Refor- 
mation, so that acts of a very miscellaneous character were from 
time to time brought within the scope of enactments passed 
for a very different purpose. For instance, the penalties of 
praemunire were incurred, under an act of Queen Elizabeth 
(1 571), for denying the Queen 's title; and under an act of James I. 
the Statute of Monopolies (1623), for obtaining any stay of 
proceedings (other than by arrest of judgment or a writ of error) 
in any suit for a monopoly; under an act of Charles I. (1640) the 
attempting to restrain the importation or making of gunpowder 
was a praemunire; in the reign of Charles II. an act of 1661 
made the asserting maliciously and advisedly, by speaking or 
writing, that both or either house of parliament has a legis- 
lative authority without the king, a praemunire. In the same 
reign, the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 made the committing of 
any man to prison out of the realm a praemunire, unpardonable 
even by the king. It thus appears that while the Crown by 
its prerogative might at any time remit the whole or any part 

^of the punishment incurred by a praemunire, an exception was 
made in transgressions of the Statute of Habeas Corpus. 1 An 
act of William III. (1695) made Serjeants, counsellors, proctors, 
attorneys, and all officers of courts practising without having 

^ taken the proper oaths guilty of a praemunire. By the Suc- 
cession to the Crown Act 1707, verbally to assert the rights of 
a person to the Crown contrary to the Acts of Settlement and 
Union is praemunire (to do so by writing or printing is treason). 
The Royal Marriages Act 1772 is the last statute which sub- 
jects anyone to the penalties of a praemunire. A peer charged 
with praemunire is not entitled to trial by his peers, but is to 

^bc tried by a jury. The most famous historical instance of a 
prosecution of the Statute of Praemunire was that of Cardinal 
Wolsey in 1529.

PRAENESTE (mod. Palestrina), a very ancient city of Latium, 
lies 23 m. E. of Rome by the Via Praenestina (see below), on 
a spur of the Apennines facing the Alban Hills. To the natural 
strength of the place and its commanding situation Praeneste 
owed in large measure its historical importance. There are 
various legends as to its foundation. Objects in metal and 
ivory discovered in the earliest graves prove that as early as the 
8th or 7th century B.C. Praeneste had reached a considerable 
degree of civilization and stood in commercial relations not only 
with Etruria but with the East. At this time the city was pro- 
bably under the hegemony of Alba Longa, then the head of the 
Latin League. In 499 B.C., according to Livy, Praeneste with- 
drew from the Latin League, in the list of whose members given 
by Dionysius (v. 61) it occurs, and formed an alliance with Rome. 
After Rome had been weakened by the Gallic invasion (390) 
Praeneste joined its foes in a long struggle with Rome. The 
struggle culminated in the great Latin War (340-38), in which 
the Romans were victorious, and Praeneste was punished for 

t 1 Sir T. E. Tomlins says that there is only one instance of a prose- 
cution on a praemunire to be found in the state trials, in which case 
the penalties were inflicted upon some persons for refusing to take 



its share in the war by the loss of part of its territory. It was 
not, however, like most other Latin cities, embodied in the 
Roman state, but continued in the position of a city in alliance 
with Rome down to the Social War, when it received the Roman 
franchise (in 90 B.C., probably as one of those cities which had 
not rebelled or had laid down their arms at once), which in 
215 B.C. some of its citizens — who had bravely held Casilinum 
against Hannibal, and only surrendered when pressed by hunger 
— had refused to accept. 

As an allied city it furnished contingents to the Roman army 
and possessed the right of exile (jus exilii) ) i.e. persons banished 
from Rome were allowed to reside at Praeneste. To judge from 
the works of art and inscriptions of this period (338 to 00 B.C.), 
it must have been for the place a time of prosperity, and even 
luxury. The nuts of Praeneste were famous and its roses were 
amongst the finest in Italy. The Latin spoken at Praeneste 
was somewhat peculiar, 2 and was ridiculed to some extent by 
the Romans. In the civil wars of Sulla the younger Marius 
was blockaded in the town by the Sullans (82 B.C.); and on its 
capture Marius slew himself, the male inhabitants were mas- 
sacred in cold blood, and a military colony was settled on part 
of its territory, though, possibly owing to the extravagance of 
the new colonic we find that in 6$ B.C. this was already in the 
possession of large proprietors. It was probably in 82 B.C. that 
the city was removed from the hill-side to the lower ground at 
the Madonna dell' Aquila, and that the temple of Fortune was 
enlarged so as to include much of the space occupied by the 
ancient city. From an inscription found in 1907 it appears 
that Sulla delegated the foundation of the new colony to 
M. Terentius Varro Lucullus, who was consul in 73 B.C. Under 
the empire Praeneste, from its elevated situation and cool 
salubrious air, became a favourite summer resort of the wealthy 
Romans, wbose villas studded the neighbourhood. Horace 
ranked it with Tibur and Baiae, though as a fact it never 
became so fashionable a residence as Tibur or the Alban Hills. 
Still, Augustus resorted thither; here Tiberius recovered from a 
dangerous illness, and here Hadrian probably built himself a 
villa. Marcus Aurelius also had a villa here. Amongst private 
persons who owned villas at Praeneste were Pliny the younger 
and Symmachus. Inscriptions show that the inhabitants of 
Praeneste were especially fond of gladiatorial shows. 

But Praeneste was chiefly famed for its great temple of Fortune 
and for its oracle, in connexion with the temple, known as the 
" Praenestine lots " (sortes praentstinae). The oldest portion of 
the sanctuary was, however, that situated on the lowest terrace 
but one. Here is a grotto in the natural rock, containing a 
beautiful coloured mosaic pavement, representing a sea-scene — 
a temple of Poseidon on the shore, with various fish swimming 
in the sea. To the east of this is a large space, now open, but 
once very possibly roofed, and forming a basilica in two storeys, 
built against the rock on the north side, and there decorated with 
pilasters also; and to the east again is an apsidal hall, often 
identified with the temple itself, in which the famous mosaic 
with scenes from the Nile, now in the Palazzo Barberini on the 
uppermost terrace, was found. Under this hall is a chamber, 
which, as an inscription on its walls shows, served as a treasury 
in the 2nd century B.C. In front of this temple an obelisk 
was erected in the reign of Claudius, fragments of which still 
exist. The modern cathedral, just below the level of this 
temple, occupies the civil basilica of the town, upon the facade 
of which was a sun-dial, described by Varro (traces of which may 
still be seen). In the modern piazza the steps leading up to 
this latter basilica and the base of a large monument were found 
in 1907; so that only a part of the piazza represents the ancient 
forum. As extended by Sulla the sanctuary of Fortune occu- 
pied a series of five vast terraces, which, resting on gigantic 

2 Thus the Praenestines shortened some words: they said coma 
for ciconia, tammodo for tantummodo (Plaut. True. iii. 2, 23; Id. 
Trinum. iii. 1, 8; cf. Comment, on Festus, p. 731, ed. Lindemann), 
and inscriptions exhibit the forms Acmemeno and Tondrus for 
Agamemno and Tyndarus. ^ They said nefrones for nefrendes in the 
sense of testkuli and tongitio for notio (Festus, s.v. " nefrendes " and 
" tongere "). Cf. Quintilian, Instit. i. 5, 56.

substructions of masonry and connected with each other by grand 
staircases, rose one above the other on the hill in the form of 
the side of a pyramid, crowned on the highest terrace by the 
round temple of Fortune. This immense edifice, probably 
by far the largest sanctuary in Italy, must have presented a 
most imposing aspect, visible as it was from a great part of 
Latium, from Rome, and even from the sea. The ground at 
the foot of the lowest terrace is 1476 ft. above sea-level; here 
is a cistern, divided into ten large chambers, in brick-faced 
concrete. The goddess Fortuna here went by the name of 
Primigenia (First-Bom, but perhaps in an active sense First- 
Bearer); she was represented suckling two babes, said to be 
Jupiter and Juno, and she was especially worshipped by matrons. 
The oracle continued to be consulted down to Christian times, 
until Constantine, and again later Theodosius, forbade the 
practice and closed the temple. A bishop of Praeneste is first 
mentioned in a.d. 313. In 1297 the Colonna family, who jthen 
owned Praeneste (Palestrina), revolted from the pope, but in the 
following year the town was taken and razed to the ground. In 
1437 the city, which had been rebuilt, was captured by the papal 
general Cardinal Vitelleschi and once more utterly destroyed. 
It was rebuilt and fortified by Stefano Colonna in 1448. In 
1630 it passed by purchase into the Barberini family. Prae- 
neste was the native town of Aelian, and in modern times of 
the great composer (Giovanni) Pierluigi da Palestrina. 

The modern town of Palestrina , a collection of narrow and filthy 
alleys, stands on the terraces once occupied by the temple of Fortune. 
On the summit of the hill (2471 ft.), nearly a mile from the town, 
stood the ancient citadel, the site of which is now occupied by a 
few poor houses (Castel San Pietro) and a ruined medieval castle 
of the Colonna. The magnificent view embraces Soracte, Rome, 
the Alban Hills and the Campagna as far as the sea. Considerable 
portions of the southern wall of the ancient citadel, built in very 
massive Cyclopean masonry of blocks of limestone, are still to be 
seen ; and the two walls, also polygonal, which formerly united the 
citadel with the town, can still be traced. The ruins of the villa 
attributed to Hadrian stand in the plain near the church of S. Maria 
della Villa, about three-quarters of a mile fpm the town. Here 
was discovered the Braschi Antinoiis, now in the Vatican. The 
calendar, which, as Suetonius tells us, was set up by the grammarian, 
M. Verrius Flaccus in the forum of Praeneste (the reference being to 
the forum of the imperial period, at the Madonna dell' Aquila), was 
discovered in the ruins of the church of S. Agapitus in 1771, where 
it has been used as building material (C. Hiilsen in Corp. inscr. lat. 
2nd ed. i. 230). Excavations made, especially since 1855, in the 
ancient necropolis, which lay on a plateau surrounded by valleys 
at the foot of the hill, and of the town, have yielded important 
results for the history of the art and manufactures of Praeneste. 
Of the objects found in the oldest graves, and supposed to date from 
about the 7th century B.C., the cups of silver and silver-gilt and most 
of the gold and amber jewelry are Phoenician (possibly Carthaginian), 
or at least made on Phoenician models; but the bronzes and some 
of the ivory articles seem to be Etruscan. No objects have been 
discovered belonging to the period intermediate between the 7th 
and 3rd centuries B.C. ; but " from about 250 B.C. onwards we have 
a series of Praenestine graves surmounted by the characteristic 
1 pine-apple ' of local stone, containing stone coffins with rich 
bronze, ivory and gold ornaments beside the skeleton. From these 
come the bronze cistae and specula with partly (but far from wholly) 
Etruscan inscriptions, for which Praeneste is renowned " (Conway, 
Ital. Dial.), Among these is the famous Ficoroni casket, engraved 
with pictures of the arrival of the Argonauts in Bithynia and the 
victory of Pollux over Amycus. It was found in 1738. "The 
caskets are unique in Italy, but a large number of mirrors of precisely 
similar style have been discovered in Etruria and are published 
in full by the German Archaeological School at Rome: Etruskische 
Spiegeln, vol. v. sqq. (Berlin, 1884). Hence, although a priori it would 
be reasonable to conjecture that objects with Etruscan character- 
istics came from Etruria, the evidence, positive and negative, points 
decisively to an Etruscan factory in or near Praeneste itself " (Con- 
way, ibid.). Most of the objects discovered in the necropolis are 
preserved in the Roman collections, especially in the Kircherian 
Museum (which possesses the Ficoroni casket) and the Barberini 
library.

PRAETOR (Lat. prae-itor, " he who goes before," "a leader"), 
originally a military title, was in classical times the designation 
of the highest magistrates in the Latin towns. The Roman 
consuls were at first called praetors; in the early code of the 
Twelve Tahles (450 B.C.) they appear to have had no other title. 
By the Licinian law of 367, which abolished the military 
tribunes with consular power and enacted that the supreme 
executive should henceforward be in the hands of the two consuls, 
a new magistrate was at the same time created who was to be a 
colleague of the consuls, though with lower rank and lesser 
powers. This new magistrate was entrusted with the exclusive 
jurisdiction in civil cases; in other respects his powers resembled 
those of the consuls. His distinctive title was the city praetor 
{praetor urbanus), and in af tertime, when the number of praetors 
was increased, the city praetor always ranked first. To this new 
magistrate the title of " praetor " was thenceforward properly 
restricted. 1 About 242 the increase of a foreign population 
in Rome necessitated the creation of a second praetor for the 
decision of suits between foreigners (peregrini) or between 
citizens and foreigners. This praetor was known at a later time 
as the " foreign praetor " (praetor peregrinus)? About 227 two 
more praetors were added to administer the recently acquired 
provinces of Sicily and Sardinia. The conquest of Spain 
occasioned the appointment of two more in 197, of whom one 
governed Hither and the other Further Spain. The number 
of praetors, thus augmented to six, remained stationary till 
Sulla's time (82). But in the interval their duties vastly 
multiplied. On the one hand, five new provinces were added 
to the Roman dominions — Macedonia and Achaia in 146, Africa 
in the same year, Asia in 134, Gallia Narbonensis in 118, Cilicia 
probably in 102. On the other hand, new and permanent jury 
courts (quaestiones perpetuae) were instituted at Rome, over which 
the praetors were called on to preside. To meet this increase 
of business the tenure of office of the praetors and also of the 
consuls was practically prolonged from one to two years, with the 
distinction that in their second year of office they bore the titles 
of propraetor and proconsul instead of praetor and consul. The 
prolongation of office, together with the participation of the 
proconsuls in duties which properly fell to the praetors, formed 
the basis of Sulla's arrangements. He increased the number of 
the praetors from six to eight, and ordained that henceforward 
all the eight should in their first year administer justice at 
Rome and in their second should as propraetors undertake the 
government of provinces. The courts over which the praetors 
presided, in addition to those of the city praetor and the foreign 
praetor, dealt with the following offences: oppression of the 
provincials by governors (repetundarum) , bribery (ambitus), 
embezzlement (peadatus), treason (majestatis), murder (de sica- 
riis el veneficis), and probably forgery (falsi). A tenth province 

1 Some writers, following Livy vi. 42, assert that at first the 
praetorship was open to patricians only, but Mommsen (Rom. 
Staaisrechi ii. 195 [204] shows that this is probably a mistake. 
The election of a plebeian to the office for the first time in 337 
was certainly opposed by the consul who presided at the election, 
but there appears to have been no legal obstacle to it. 

1 [His official title in republican times was Praetor qui inter pere- 
grinos jus dicit, under the empire Praetor qui inter ctves peregrinos 
jus dicit, until the time of Vespasian, when the abbreviated title 
praetor peregrinus came into use.]

(Gallia cisalpina) was added to the previous nine, and thus the 
number of judicial and provincial departments corresponded 
to the annual number of praetors, propraetors and proconsuls. 
The proportion, however, was not long maintained: new pro- 
vinces were added to the empire — Bithynia in 74, Cyrene about 
the same time, Crete in 67, Syria in 64 — and one or more new 
law courts were instituted. To keep pace with the increase 
of duties Julius Caesar increased the number of praetors 
successively to ten, fourteen and sixteen; after his time the 
number varied from eight to eighteen. 

The praetors were elected, like the consuls, by the people 
assembled in the comitia centuriata and with the same formal- 
ities. 1 They regularly held office for a year; only in the 
transition period between the republic and the empire was 
their tenure of office sometimes limited to a few months. 2 The 
insignia of the praetor were those common to the higher Roman 
magistrates — the purple-edged robe {toga praetexta) and the 
ivory chair {sella curulis); in Rome he was attended by two 
lictors, in the provinces- by six. The praetors elect cast lots 
to determine the department which each of them should ad- 
minister. A praetor was essentially a civil judge, and as such 
he was accustomed at or before his entry on office to publish an 
edict setting forth the rules of law and procedure by which he 
intended to be guided in his decisions. As these rules were often 
accepted by his successors, the praetor thus acquired an almost 
legislatorial power, and his edicts, thus continued, corrected 
and amplified from year to year, became, under the title of the 
" perpetual " edicts, one of the most important factors in mould- 
ing Roman law. Their tendency was to smooth away the 
occasional harshness and anomalies* of the civil law by substitu- 
ting rules of equity for the letter of the law, and in this respect 
the Roman praetor has been compared to the English chancellor. 
His functions were considerably modified by the introduction 
of the standing jury courts {quaestiones perpetuae). Hitherto 
the praetor had conducted the preliminary inquiry as to whether 
an action would lie, and had appointed for the actual trial of the 
case a deputy, whom he instructed in the law applicable to the 
case and whose decisions he enforced. The proceedings before 
the praetor were technically known as jus in distinction from 
judicium, which was the actual trial before the deputy judge. 
But in the standing jury courts (of which the first— that for 
repetundae — was instituted in 149), or rather in the most im- 
portant of them, the praetors themselves presided and tried 
the cases. These new courts, though formally civil, were sub- 
stantially criminal courts; and thus a criminal jurisdiction was 
added to the original civil jurisdiction of the praetors. Under 
the empire various special functions were assigned to certain 
praetors, such as the two treasury praetors {praetor es aerarii),* 
appointed by Augustus in 23; the spear praetor {praetor has- 
tarius), who presided over the court of the Hundred Men, which 
dealt especially with cases of inheritance; the two trust praetors 
{praetores jideicommissarii) , appointed by Claudius to look after 
cases of trust estates, but reduced by Titus to one; the ward 
praetor {praetor tutelaris) t appointed by Marcus Aurelius to deal 
with the affairs of minors; and the liberation praetor {praetor de 
liberalibus causis), who tried cases turning on the liberation of 
slaves. 4 There is no evidence that the praetors continued to 
preside over the standing courts after the beginning of the 3rd 
century a.d., and the foreign praetorship disappears about this 
time. 6 Even the jurisdiction of the city praetor seems not to 
have survived the reforms of Diocletian, though the office itself 
continued to exist. But of the praetorships with special juris- 
diction (especially the ward praetorship and the liberation

praetorship) some lasted into the 4th century and were copied 
in the constitution of Constantinople. 

Besides their judicial functions, the praetors, as colleagues 
of the consuls, possessed, though in a less degree, all the con- 
sular powers, which they regularly exercised in the absence of 
the consuls; but in the presence of a consul they exercised them 
only at the special command either of the consul or, more usually, 
of the senate. Thus the praetor possessed military power 
{imperium); even the city praetor, though attached by his office 
to Rome, could not only levy troops but also in certain cir- 
cumstances take the command in person. As provincial gover- 
nors the praetors had frequent occasion to exercise their military 
powers, and they were often accorded a triumph. The city 
praetor presided over popular assemblies for the election of 
certain inferior magistrates, but all the praetors officiating in 
Rome had the right to summon assemblies for the purpose of 
legislation. In the absence of the consuls the city praetor, and 
in default of him the other praetors, were empowered to call 
meetings of the senate. Public religious duties, such as the 
fulfilment of state vows, the celebration of sacrifices and games, 
and the fixing of the dates of movable feasts, probably only fell 
to the praetors in the absence of the consuls. But since in the 
early times the consuls as a rule spent only the first months 
of their year of office in Rome, it is probable that a consider- 
able share of religious business devolved on the city praetor; 
this was certainly the case with the Festival of the Cross-roads 
{compitalia), and he directed the games in honour of Apollo from 
their institution in 212. Augustus in 22 placed the direction 
of all the popular festivals in the hands of the praetors, and it 
is not without significance that the praetors continued thus 
to minister to the pleasures of the Roman mob for centuries 
after they had ceased almost entirely to transact the business of 
the state. (For the praetor as provincial governor see 
Province.) (j. g. Fr. ; X.) 

A full account of the praetorship will be found in Mommsen, 
Romisches Staatsrecht (1887), vol. ii. and P. Willems, Le Droit public 
romain (1883); T. M. Taylor's Constilutional and Political History 
of Rome (1899) will also be found useful. There is a monograph by 
E. Labatut, Histoire de la priture (1868). 

PRAETORIANS. In the early Roman republic, praetor 
{q.v.) meant commander of the army: in the later republic 
praetor and propraetor were the usual titles for provincial gover- 
nors with military powers. Accordingly, the general's quarters 
in a camp came to be called praetorium,* and one of the gates 
porta praetoria, and the general's bodyguard cohors praetoria, 
or, if large enough to include several cohorts, cohortes prae- 
toriae. Under the empire the nomenclature continued with 
some changes. In particular cohortes praetoriae now designated 
the imperial bodyguard. This, as founded by Augustus, con- 
sisted of nine cohorts, each 1000 strong, some part of which was 
always with the emperor, whether in Rome or elsewhere. In 
a.d. 23 his successor Tiberius concentrated this force on the 
eastern edge of Rome in fortified barracks: hence one cohort in 
turn, clad in civilian garb, was sent to the emperor's house on 
the Palatine, and large detachments could be despatched to 
foreign wars. The men were recruited voluntarily, in Italy or in 
Italianized districts, and enjoyed better pay and shorter service 
than the regular army : they were under praefecti praetoria (usually 
two; later, sometimes three, rarely only one), who during most 
of the empire might not be senators. This force was the only 
body of troops in Rome (save a few cohortes urbanae, a fire 
brigade, and some non-Roman personal guards of the emperor), 
or, indeed, anywhere near the capital. Accordingly it could make 
or unmake emperors in crises — at the accession of Claudius in 
a.d. 41, in 68-69, and again late in the second century. But 
its normal influence was less than is often asserted. Moreover, 
its prefects, since they were two and liable to be disunited, and 
since they could not be senators, neither combined with the 

8 In permanent forts and fortresses, praetorium probably denoted 
strictly a residence: the official headquarters building (though 
commonly styled praetorium by moderns) was the principta. On 
the other hand praetorium could denote any lord's residence, even 
on a civilian's estate.

senators to restore an oligarchy nor themselves aspired as 
pretenders to the throne. These prefects were at first soldiers, 
but later mostly lawyers who relieved the emperors of various 
civil and criminal jurisdiction. In the second century the 
praetorian cohorts became ten in number, and at the end of it 
Septimius Severus reorganized them so that they consisted prac- 
tically of barbarian soldiers and held constant conflict with the 
people of Rome. At the end of the third century the praefecti 
praetorio were reconstituted as four officers, each ruling one 
quarter of the now divided empire. In 312 the Praetorian 
Guard was suppressed by Constantine. Their barracks at Rome 
covering a rectangle of 39 acres (i2ioby 1410 ft.), were included 
by Aurelian in the walls of Rome, and three sides of the enceinte 
can still be seen near the Porta Pia, with brickwork as old as 
Tiberius: the interior (now barracks for the Italian army) is 
archaeologically less interesting. 

PRAETORIUS, MICHAEL (1571-1621), German musical 
historian, theorist and composer, was born at Kreuzberg, in 
Thuringia, on the 15th of February 1571. His father's name 
was Michael Schultheis. 1 While he was still quite young he 
visited the university of Frankfort on the Oder for three years. 
Here he studied philosophy, and on the death of his brother, on 
whose support he relied, he was given a post as organist in the 
town. He acted as kapellmeister at Liineburg early in life, 
was engaged first as organist and later as kapellmeister and 
secretary to the duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel, and was 
eventually rewarded for his long services with the priory of 
Ringelheim, near Goslar. He died at Wolfenbiittel on the 1 5th 
of February 1621. Of his very numerous compositions copies 
are now very scarce. The most important are : Polyhymnia 
(15 vols.), Musae Sioniae (16 vols.), and Musa Aonia (9 vols.), 
all written partly to Latin and partly to German words. But 
more precious than all these is the Syntagma musicutn (3 vols, 
and a cahier of plates, 4to, Wittenberg and Wolfenbiittel, 
161 5-1620). In the original prospectus of the work four 
volumes were promised, but it is certain that no more than 
three were ever published. The fourth volume mentioned in 
Forkel's catalogue is clearly nothing but the ^cahier of plates 
attached to vol. ii. 

The chief value of this very remarkable work lies in the 
information it gives concerning the condition of instrumental 
music in the early years of the 37th century. The plates 
include excellent representations of all the musical instruments 
in use at the time they were published, together with many 
forms even then treated only as antique curiosities. The work 
thus throws a light upon the earlier forms of instrumental 
music which to the historian is invaluable. In fact, without 
the information bequeathed to us by Praetorius it would be 
impossible to reconstruct in theory the orchestra of the earlier 
half of the 17th century, during which the opera and the oratorio 
both sprang into existence, or even to understand the descrip- 
tions left us by other less careful writers. 

PRAETUTTII (also called Upairernoi), a tribe of ancient 
Italy inhabiting the south of Picenum. Their territory lay 
between the rivers Vomanum and Tessinnus (Pliny iii. § no), 
and therefore included Cast rum Novum, Interamnia and the 
Truentus, as well as probably the original of Hadria. From 
this name was derived the medieval form Aprutium (quoted by 
Kiepert in his Alte Geographic), and hence the modern Abruzzo 
(more commonly in the plural gli Abntzzi), denoting the whole 
central mountain land of Italy. We have no evidence, except 
their name, and that throws no light on their language, for 
separating them from the other inhabitants of Picenum (q.v).

PRAGMATIC SANCTION (Lat. pragmatica sanctio, from the 
Gr. irpHyna, business), originally a term of the later Roman 
law. It is found in the Theodosian and Justinian codes, together 
with such variants as a pragmaticum, pragmatica jussio, com- 
mand; annotatio, an imperial rescript; constitution a regulation; 

1 German Schultz or Schultze {Schultheis s), meaning the head-man 
of a township, latinized into praetor or praetorius. Many other 
members of the family of Praetorius were eminent as musicians. 



and pragmaticum rescriptam. It was a decision of the state 
dealing with some interest greater than a question in dispute 
between private persons, and was given for some community 
{universitas hominum) and for a public cause. In more recent 
times it was adopted by those countries which followed the 
Roman law, and in particular by despotically governed countries 
where the rulers had a natural tendency to approve of the 
maxims and to adopt the language of the imperial Roman 
lawyers. A pragmatic sanction, as the term was used by them, 
was an expression of the will of the sovereign or " the prince," 
defining the limits of his own power, or regulating the succession. 
Justinian regulated the government of Italy after it had been 
reconquered from the Ostrogoths by pragmatic sanctions. 
In after ages the king of France, Charles VII., imposed limits 
on the claims of the popes to exercise jurisdiction in his dominions 
by the pragmatic sanction of Bourges in 1438. The emperor 
Charles VI. settled the law of succession for the dominions of 
the house of Habsburg by pragmatic sanction first published on 
the 19th of April 17 13, and thereby prepared the way for the 
great war which ensued upon his death. Philip V., the first of 
the Bourbon kings of Spain, introduced the Salic law by a 
pragmatic sanction, and his descendant, Ferdinand VIL, revoked 
it by another. The term was not used in England even for such 
things as the will by which Henry VIII. regulated the succession 
to the throne, which would have been a pragmatic sanction in a 
country of the Roman law. The term and the thing signified 
by it have become obsolete owing to the spread of constitutional 
government in modern Europe. 

PRAGMATISM, in philosophy, etymologically a theory or 
method of dealing with real things (Gr. Tpayjiara: cf. 
7rpa7jLtarifco5, versed in affairs). "Pragmatic, " as here employed 
is not used in the common colloquial sense of " pragmatical," 
i.e. " fussy and positive," nor in the historical sense, as in 
" Pragmatic Sanction," of " relating to affairs of state," but in 
the sense of practical or efficient. 2 Pragmatism, as a general 
philosophic doctrine or mental attitude, can only be understood 
as part of a reaction against the intellectualistic speculation 
which has characterized most of modern metaphysics. It 
arises from a general awakening to the fact that the growth 
of our psychological and biological knowledge must profoundly 
transform the traditional epistemology. It follows that " prag- 
matic " lines of thought may originate from a multiplicity of 
considerations and in a variety of contexts. These, however, 
may be conveniently classified under four main heads — psycho- 
logical, logical, ethical and religious — and the history of the 
subject shows that all these have contributed to the develop- 
ment of pragmatism. 

1. Psychologically, pragmatism starts from the efficacy and all- 
pervasiveness of mental activity, and points out that interest, 
attention, selection, purpose, bias, desire, emotion, satisfaction, 
&c, colour and control all our cognitive processes. It insists 
that all thought is personal and purposive and that "pure" 
thought is a figment. A judgment which is not prompted by 
motives and inspired by interest, which has not for its aim the 
satisfaction of a cognitive purpose, is psychologically impossible, 
and it is, therefore, mistaken to construct a logic which abstracts 
from all these facts. Nor is the presence of such non-intellectual 
factors in thinking necessarily deleterious: at any rate they are 
ineradicable. Truths are always on one side matters of belief, 
and beliefs are ultimately rules for action. The whole function- 
ing of our mental apparatus is directed upon yielding the right 
response to the stimulations of the environment, and is valuable 
if and in so far as it does this. The " psychologism " thus 
introduced into logic amounts to a systematic protest against the 
notion of a dehumanized thought and the study of logic in 
abstraction from actual psychic process. 

2. In its logical aspect pragmatism originates in a criticism 
of fundamental conceptions like " truth," " error," " fact " 

2 The New English Dictionary quotes for nine distinct senses of 
the word, of which the philosophic is the eighth. The seven earlier 
ones are all more or less obsolescent, and their very number shows 
that the meaning of the word was very vague.

and " reality, " the current accounts of which it finds untenable 
or unmeaning. " Truth," for example, cannot be defined as 
the agreement or correspondence of thought with " reality," 
for how can thought determine whether it correctly " copies " 
what transcends it? Nor can our truth be a copy of a trans- 
cendent and absolute truth (Dewey). If it be asked, therefore, 
what such phrases mean, it is found that their meaning is really 
defined by their use. The real difference between two concep- 
tions lies in their application, in the different consequences for 
the purposes of life which their acceptance carries. When no 
such " practical " difference can be found, conceptions are 
identical; when they will not " work," i.e. when they thwart 
the purpose which demanded them, they are false; when they 
are inapplicable they are unmeaning (A. Sidgwick). Hence 
the " principle of Peirce " may be formulated as being that 
" every truth has practical consequences, and these arc the test 
of its truth." It is clear that this (1) implicitly considers truth 
as a value, and so connects it with the conception of good, and 
(2) openly raises the question — What is truth, and how is it to 
be distinguished from error? This accordingly becomes the 
central problem of pragmatism. This same issue also arises 
independently out of the breakdown or rationalistic theories 
of knowledge (F. H. Bradley, H. H. Joachim). Logical analysis, 
after assuming that truth is independent and not of our making, 
has to confess that all logical operations involve an apparently 
arbitrary interference with their data (Bradley). Again, it 
assumes an ideal of truth which turns out to be humanly unat- 
tainable and incompatible with the existence of error, and an 
ideal of science which no human science can be conceived as 
attaining. The obvious way of avoiding the scepticism into 
which rationalism is thus driven is to revise the assumptions 
about the nature and postulates of truth which lead to it. 

3. The ethical affinities of pragmatism spring from the 
perception that all knowing is referred to a purpose. This 
at once renders it " useful," i.e. a means to an end or " good." 
Completely " useless " knowledge becomes impossible, though 
the uses of knowledge may still vary greatly in character, in 
directness, and in the extent and force of their appeal to different 
minds. This relation to a " good " must not, however, be 
construed as a doctrine of ethics in the narrower sense; nor is 
its " utilitarianism " to be confused with the hedonism of the 
British associationists. " Useful " means " good for an (any) 
end," and the " good " which the " true " claims must be 
understood as cognitive. But cognitive " good " and moral 
" good " are brought into close connexion, as species of ideo- 
logical " good " and contributory to " the Good." Thus only 
the generic, not the specific, difference between them is abolished. 
The " true " becomes a sort of value, like the beautiful and the 
(moral) good. Moreover, since the " real " is the object of the 
" true," and can be distinguished from the " unreal " only by 
developing superior value in the process of cognition which 
arrives at it, the notions of " reality " and " fact " also turn out 
to be disguised forms of value. Thus the dualism between 
judgments of fact and judgments of value disappears: whatever 
"" facts" we recognize are seen to be relative to the complex 
of human purposes to which they are revealed. It should 
further be noted that pragmatism conceives " practice " very 
widely: it includes everything related to the control of experi- 
ence. The dualism, therefore, between " practice " and 
" theory " also vanishes; a " theory " unrelated to practice 
(however indirectly) is simply an illusion. Lastly it may be 
pointed out that, as asserting the efficacy of thought and 
the reality of choice, pragmatism involves a real, though 
determinable, indetermination in the course of events. 

4. Pragmatism has very distinctly a connexion with religion, 
because it explains, and to some extent justifies, the faith- 
attitude or will to believe, and those who study the psychology 
of religion cannot but be impressed with the pragmatic nature 
of this attitude. If the whole of a man's personality goes to 
the making of the truth he accepts, it is clear that his beliefs 
are^ not matters of " pure reason," and that his passional and 
volitional nature must contribute to them and cannot validly 



be excluded. His religion also is ultimately a vital attitude 
which rests on his interests and on his choices between alterna- 
tives which are real for him. It is not however asserted that his 
mere willing to believe is a proof of the truth of what he wishes 
to believe, any more than a will to disbelieve justifies disbelief. 
His will to believe merely recognizes that choice is necessary and 
implies risk, and puts him .in a position to obtain verification 
(or disproof). The pragmatic claim for religion, therefore, is 
that to those who will take the first step and will to believe an 
encouraging amount of the appropriate verifications accrues. 
It is further pointed out that this procedure is quite consonant 
with the practice of science with regard to its axioms. Origin- 
ally these are always postulates which have to be assumed before 
they can be proved, and thus in a way " make " the evidence 
which confirms them. Scientific and religious verification 
therefore, though superficially distinct, are alike in kind. 

The pragmatic doctrine of truth, which it is now possible to 
outline, results from a convergence of the above lines of argument. 
Because truth is a value and vitally valuable, and all meaning 
depends on its context and its relation to us, there cannot be any 
abstract " absolute " truth disconnected from all human pur- 
poses. Because all truth is primarily a claim which may turn 
out to be false, it has to be tested. To test it is to try to dis- 
tinguish between truth and falsity, and to answer the question — 
What renders the claim of a judgment to be true, really true? 
Now such testing, though it varies greatly in different depart- 
ments of knowledge, is always effected by the consequences to 
which the claim leads when acted on. Only if they are " good " 
is the claim validated and the reasoning judged to be " right ": 
only if they arc tested does the theory of truth become intelligible 
and that of error explicable. If, therefore, a logic fails to employ 
the pragmatic test, it is doomed to remain purely formal, and 
the possibility of applying its doctrines to actual knowing," and 
their real validity, remain in doubt. By applying the pragmatic 
test on the other hand, it is possible to describe how truths are 
developed and errors corrected, and how in general old truths 
are adjusted to new situations. This " making of truth " is 
conceived as making for greater satisfaction and greater control 
of experience. It renders the truth of any time relative to the 
knowledge of the time, and precludes the notion of any rigid, 
static or incorrigible truth. Thus truth is continually being 
made and re-made. If the new truth seems to be such that our 
cognitive purposes would have been better served by it than 
they were by the truth we had at the time, it is antedated and 
said to have been " true all along." If an old truth is improved 
upon, it is revalued as " false. " To this double process there 
is no actual end, but ideally an " absolute " truth (or system of 
truths) would be a truth which would be adequate to every 
purpose. 

Extensions of pragmatism in a variety of directions readily 
suggest themselves, and indeed only the doctrine of truth in 
the above sketch can be treated as strictly indispensable. If 
however the logical method of pragmatism is critically applied 
to all the sciences, many doctrines will be cut out which have 
little or no " pragmatic value." This all-round application 
of the pragmatic method has received the .name of " humanism." 
It expressly refers itself to the maxim of Protagoras that " man 
is the measure of all things," and is best conceived as a protest 
against the assumption that logic can treat thought in abstrac- 
tion from its psychological context and the personality of the 
knower, i.e. that knowledge can be dehumanized. To arbitrary 
and unverifiable metaphysical speculation, and to forms of 
" absolutism " which have lost touch with human interests, 
this humanism is particularly destructive. It emphasizes 
still more than pragmatism the personal aspect of all knowing 
and its contribution to the " making of reality " which neces- 
sarily accompanies the making of truth. But it also goes on 
to raise the question whether the making of reality for our 
knowledge does not, in view of the essentially practical nature 
of knowledge, imply also a real making of reality by us, and so 
throw light upon the whole genesis of reality. In this direction 
pragmatism may ultimately lead to a number of metaphysics, 



248 



PRAGUE 



each of which will represent a personal guess at a final synthesis 
of experience, while remaining essentially undogmatic and 
improvable. The great variety and impermanence of meta- 
physical systems in the past thus find their explanation : they 
were all along what they are now recognized as being, viz. 
personal efflorescences provoked by a totality of experiences 
which differed in each case. 

As regards the history and bibliography of pragmatism, the term 
was first invented by C. S. Peiree in discussions with William James 
at Harvard University, and its meaning was expounded by him 
in an article on " How to make our Ideas clear in the Popular 
Science Monthly for January 1878. The pragmatic test of truth 
was referred to by James in his Will to Believe (1896, p. 124, in a 
paper first published in 1881). The validity of the argument from 
consequences and the connexion of truth with what " works " was 
asserted a propos of A. J. Balfour's Foundations of Belief by A. Seth 
Pringle-Pattison in his Man's Place in Cosmos (1897, p. 307). But 
the word " pragmatism " itself first occurs in print in 1898, in James's 
pamphlet on Theoretical Conceptions and Practical Results , and again 
in his Varieties of Religious Experience (1902, p. 444). It was rapidly 
taken up, first by W. Caldwell in Mind (1900, new series, No. 36), and 
by F. C. S. Schiller in Personal Idealism (1902). James himself at 
first developed chiefly the psychological and ethical aspects of the 
doctrine in his epoch-making Principles of Psychology (1890) and his 
Will to Believe. The application to logic, therefore, was mainly 
made by his followers, John Dewey and his pupils, in the Chicago 
Decennial Publications and especially in their Studies in Logical 
Theory (1903), where, however, the term used is " instrumentalism," 
and by F. C. S. Schiller, in " Axioms as Postulates " (in Personal 
Idealism, ed. H. Sturt, 1902), in Humanism (1903), in which that 
term was proposed for the extensions of pragmatism, in Studies in 
Humanism (1007), and in Plato or Protagoras (1008). All these 
logical and philosophic developments were popularly expounded 
by James in his Pragmatism (1907), followed by A Pluralistic 
Universe (1908) and The Meaning of Truth (1909). H. H. Bawden's 
The Principles of Pragmatism (1910) is a popular sketch. Alfred 
Sidgwiek's logical writings, especially his Distinction (1892) and 
The. Use of Words in Argument (1901), represent an independent 
development. For the religious applications see^ G. Tyrrell {Lex 
orandi, 1903, Lex credendx, 1906). Among critical writers on 
the pragmatic side may be t mentioned H. Sturt (Idola theatri, 
iqo6), and H. V. Knox {Mind, new series, No. 54)^ There is 
already a large controversial literature in the philosophic journals, 
and two critical works appeared in 1909: J. B. Pratt, What is 
Pragmatism? (1909), and A. Schinz, Anti'Pragmatism(igog). Outside 
the English-writing world, identical or kindred tendencies are 
represented in France by Leroy, Poincare\ Bergson, Milhaud, 
Blondel, Duhem, Wilbois, Pradines; in Germany by Mach, Ostwald, 
Simmel, Jerusalem, Goldseheid, Jaeoby; in Italy by Papini, Prez- 
zolini, Vailati, Troiano. In addition there are numbers of partial 
pragmatists, e.g. G. Santayana (The Life of Reason, 1905). Various 
anticipations of pragmatism in the history of philosophy are noted 
in Schiller's Plato or Protagoras ? (1908). (F. C. S. S.) 

PRAGUE (Ger. Prag; Bohemian Praha), the ancient capital 
of the Bohemian' kingdom, residence of an archbishop and 
an Imperial governor, and the meeting-place of the Bohemian 
Diet. The population of the town, including the suburbs that 
have not yet been incorporated with it, was 460,849 in 1906. 
Somewhat under a fifth of the population are Germans, the rest 
belong to the Bohemian (Czech) nationality. Prague is situated 
on both banks of the river Vltava (Ger. Moldau) in 5o°5' N., 
i4°25' E., 150 m. N.W. of Vienna and 75 S.S.E. of Dresden. 
The city is divided into eight districts, which are numbered thus: 
I. Stare mesto (the old town), II. Nove mesto (the new town); 
III. Mala strana (the small side "quarter"); IV. HradCany; 
V. Josefske mesto (Joseph's, formerly the Jewish, town); VI. 
Vysehrad; VII. Holesovic-Bubna; VIII. the suburbs Karlin 
(Ger. Karolinenthal), Vinohrady and Smichov are not yet 
incorporated with the city. Prague was by its geographical 
situation naturally destined to become the capital of Bohemia, 
as it lies in the centre of the country. The origin of Prague 
goes back to a very early date, though, as is the case with most 
very ancient cities, the tales connected with its origin are no 
doubt legendary. The earliest inhabited spot within the pre- 
cincts of the .present city was the hill named Vysehrad (higher 
castle, acropolis) on the right bank of the Vltava. Here the 
semi-mythical prince Krok, his daughter Libusa, and her 
husband the peasant Prgmysl are stated to have resided. To 
Libusa is attributed also the foundation of a settlement on the 
opposite bank of the Vltava on the Hrad£any hill. The ancient 



Bohemian chronicler Cosmas of Prague gives a very picturesque 
account of this semi-mythical occurrence. 

It is probable that at an early period buildings sprang up in 
those parts of the present Stare mesto and Mal& strana that are 
situated nearest to the banks of the river. These banks were 
from a very remote period connected by a bridge. This bridge 
was probably situated very near the spot where Charles IV. 
afterwards built the famed " bridge of Prague." It is probable 
that independently of the Hradcany and Vysehrad settlements 
a certain number of buildings existed as early as 993 on the site 
of the present Pofic Street (near the station of the state railway). 
The city continued to increase, and during the reign of King 
Vratislav (1061-1092) many Germans were attracted to Prague. 

In 1235 King Wenceslaus I. surrounded the old town — that 
is to say, the buildings on the right bank of the Vltava — with a 
wall and ditch. These fortifications, starting from the river, 
followed the line of the present Elisabeth Street, the Pfikopy 
or Graben — which therefrom derives its name, signifying ditch 
or 'trench — and then that of the Ovocna and Ferdinandova 
Streets. The Jewish quarter was included in the fortifications, 
but it was divided by gates and a wall from the old town. King 
Ottakar II. also contributed greatly to the enlargement of 
Prague. The still extant fortified towers of the Hradcany 
belong to his reign. The sovereign, however, to whom Prague 
is most indebted is the emperor Charles IV. (Charles I., as king 
of Bohemia). He has rightly been called the second founder 
of Prague. He founded the university, one of the oldest on 
the Continent. It immediately became famous all over Europe 
and students flocked to it from all countries. The town soon 
became too small, and it is probably in consequence of this that 
Charles determined to found the " new town." This, which 
includes the greater part of the modern city, was surrounded 
by walls, which starting from the foot of the Vysehrad included 
the small already-existing settlement of Pofic' and then adjoined 
the borders of the old town from the beginning of the present 
Pfikopy Street up to the river. During the Hussite wars Prague 
suffered greatly. Two of the greatest battles of the 'Hussite 
wars, that of the Zizkov and that of the Vysehrad (both 1420), 
were fought on the outskirts of Prague, and after the last-named 
battle the ancient Vysehrad castle was entirely destroyed. The 
Bohemian nobles in alliance with the citizens of the old town 
attacked and conquered the new town, wbich for a time lost 
its privileges and became subject to the old town. Prague 
gradually recovered during the reign of King George of Podebrad, 
and became yet more prosperous during that of King Vladislav. 

During the reign of Ferdinand I. of Habsburg (1 526-1 564) 
Prague played a considerable part in the opposition to that 
prince caused in Bohemia by his endeavour to reduce both 
the political and religious liberty of the country. When the 
antagonism between the Romanist dynasty and the Bohemian 
Protestants culminated in the troubles of 1546 and r547 and the 
Bohemians, after a weak and unsuccessful attempt to assert their 
liberties, were obliged to submit unconditionally to the house 
of Habsburg, Prague was deprived of many of its liberties and 
privileges. The burgomaster of the old town was one of those 
who were decapitated in the Hradcany Square (Aug. 20, 1547). 
Ferdinand had summoned a meeting of the estates on that 
day at the adjoining Hradcany palace, and it became known as 
the " bloody diet " (Krvavy snlm). 

The importance of the city of Prague greatly increased during 
the reign of Rudolph II. That sovereign chose Prague as his 
permanent residence and it thus became — as Rudolph, besides 
being king of Bohemia, was also German emperor, king of 
Hungary and ruler of the hereditary Habsburg lands — the 
centre of his vast domains. It was in Prague that the Thirty 
Years' War broke out. On the 23rd of May 1618 the Protes- 
tant nobles of Bohemia threw from the windows of the council 
chamber of the Hradcany palace two of the Imperial councillors 
who were accused of having influenced in a manner unfavourable 
to the Bohemians the emperor Matthias, who was also king of 
Bohemia. War broke out and continued when in 1619 Matthias 
was succeeded by Ferdinand. In the same year the Bohemians 






PRAGUE 



249 



elected as their king Frederick of the Palatinate, and both he 
and his wife Elizabeth of England were crowned in St Vitus's 
Cathedral. On the 8th of November i52o the Bohemian forces 
were decisively defeated by the Imperialists on the White 
Mountain at the outskirts of Prague. The town submitted on the 
following day and the whole country was quickly subdued by the 
Imperialist armies. On the 21st of June 1621 the principal 
leaders of the rising against the house of Habsburg were beheaded 
in the market of the old town near the town hall. In 1631 
Prague was occupied for a short time by the Saxon allies of 
Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, but the Imperial army led 
by Wallenstein soon obliged them to retire. In 1648 a Swedish 
army stormed the Mali strana and Hradcany. The citizens, now 
entirely Romanists, bravely defended the bridge, and the Swedes 
were unable to obtain possession of the part of Prague situated 
on the right bank of the Vltava. In November the news of 
the conclusion of the peace of Westphalia reached Prague and 
put a stop to hostilities. 

Henceforth the history of Prague continues uneventful for 
a considerable period. During the Austrian War of Succession 
it again became the scene of important events. On the 26th 
of November 1741 Prague was stormed by an army consisting 
of Bavarians, French and Saxons which upheld the cause of 
Charles, elector of Bavaria, who claimed the succession to the 
Bohemian throne and to the other domains of the house of 
Habsburg. A large part of the Bohemian nobility did homage 
to Charles, and he was crowned king of Bohemia in St Vitus's 
Cathedral on the 17th of December 1741. The rule of the 
Bavarian prince lasted, however, but a very short time. On the 
27th of June 1742 the armies of the empress Maria Theresa 
began to besiege the French army of Marshal Belle-Isle in Prague, 
and the French commander was obliged to evacuate the city in* 
December 1742. In the spring of the following year Maria 
Theresa arrived at Prague and was crowned there, but in 1744 
the city was again the scene of warfare. In that year Frederick 
the Great of Prussia invaded Bohemia and obtained possession 
of Prague after a severe and prolonged bombardment, in the 
course of which a large part of the town was destroyed. The 
Prussian occupation was, however, of short duration. At the 
beginning of the Seven Years' War Prague was — in 1757 — again 
besieged by Frederick the Great after he had defeated the 
Austrians in a battle between the Zizkov and Pocernic (com- 
monly called the battle of Prague, see Seven Years' War). 
In June of the same year the Austrian victory at Kolin obliged 
the Prussians to raise the siege. Prague, which had suffered even 
more during the second bombardment, now enjoyed a long 
period of quiet. 

In the beginning of the 19th century Prague, which had 
become almost a German city, became the centre of a movement 
that endeavoured to revive the almost extinct Bohemian nation- 
ality. This movement was greatly aided by the foundation 
of the " Society of the Bohemian Museum " in 1822. Several 
patriotic Bohemian noblemen founded this association. The 
collections belonging to it and its library were at first housed in 
the Mali strana, then in a somewhat larger building in the 
Pfikopy. They are now in a large handsome building at the 
top of the Vaclavsk6 Namesti. In connexion with the Bohemian 
museum a society named Malice (treasury) was founded, which 
published editions of the ancient Bohemian works, as well as 
writings of modern Bohemian authors. 

This movement was at first purely literary, and only in 1848 
assumed a political character. It was determined to hold at 
Prague a " Slavic congress " at which all Slavic countries were 
to be represented. During the sittings of the congress troubles 
broke out which originated in an insignificant conflict between 
students and soldiers of the garrison. Barricades were erected 
and the town finally surrendered unconditionally after a severe 
bombardment (June 1848). In 1866 the Prussians, who had 
invaded Bohemia, occupied Prague (July 8) without encounter- 
ing any resistance. At the " Blue Star " hotel in Prague also 
was signed the treaty which ended the war between Austria 
and Prussia (Aug. 23). 



In the years of peace that followed, the development of 
Prague was constant and vast. The removal of the fortifications 
greatly assisted this development. The communities of VySeh- 
rad (1883), Holesovic-Bubna (1884) and Libcn (1001) were 
consecutively included in the city. Occasional riots, such as 
in 1897, when the Bohemians were exasperated by the action 
of the Vienna government which restricted the use of the national 
language in the law courts; and in 1905, when the people 
demanded an extension of the suffrage, have not interfered with 
the increasing prosperity of the city, and their importance has 
been greatly exaggerated. 

Though numerous ancient monuments at Prague have been 
destroyed in consequence of intestine strife and foreign warfare, the 
city still contains many of great value and may be considered one 
of the most interesting cities of central Europe. The natural 
situation of the town has also at all periods been greatly admired. 
The centre of the old town and indeed of the entire community of 
Prague is the town hall (staromistskd radnice), which is surrounded 
by the market-place, the scene of the execution of the Bohemian 
patriots in 1621. The buildings of the town hall date from various 
periods. Its oldest parts are the tower and the chapel of St Lawrence, 
built in 1381. The adjoining ancient council chamber dates from 
the reign of King Vladislav (147 1-1516). The modern hall that 
is now used for the meetings of the town council is decorated by 
two paintings of the Bohemian artist Wenceslaus Brozik, which 
represent Hus before the council of Constance, and the election of 
George of Podebrad as king of Bohemia. In the market-place 
opposite the town hall is situated the ancient T<*n church, memorable 
as having been the religious centre of the Hussite movement. A 
chapel connected with the so-called Tyn or market-place of the 
German traders stood here from the earliest times, but the present 
building was begun in the 14th century, and completed in the 15th 
during the reign of George of Pode'brad. The fine facade built by 
that king was formerly adorned with a statue of King George, who 
was represented as holding a sword pointing upward to a representa- 
tion of the chalice, the emblem of the Hussite Church. Both statue 
and chalice were removed by the Jesuits in 1623. In the interior 
of the church the tomb of the astronomer Tvcho Brahe is notable, 
as is the very ancient pulpit from which the Hussite archbishop 
John of Rokyean preached. In earlier days the Church reformers 
Milic* and Hus also preached here. Close to the town hall is the 
Joseph-Stadt, the ancient ghetto of Prague. The synagogue is 
one of the oldest in Europe, and the adjoining cemetery — part of 
which has unfortunately been destroyed in the course of the modern 
sanitary improvement^ of this part of Prague — has great historical 
interest. The university founded by Charles IV. in 1348 played a 
great part in the history of Bohemia during the Hussite wars. The 
lecture-rooms and other institutions connected with the two univer- 
sities — in i88i*and 1882 a Bohemian university was founded though 
the German one continued to exist — are now housed in two vast 
buildings known as the Carolinum and the Clementinum. The 
Carolinum, first built about the year 1383 but frequently altered, 
has a closer connexion with Hus and the Hussite movement than 
any other building at Prague. It was the scene of many religious 
discussions, and it was here also that the Bohemian nobles met 
before the uprising of 1618. The large part of the lecture-rooms, the 
observatory and the very valuable library are in the Clementinum. 
This building was formerly a college of the Jesuits, who established 
themselves in Prague in 1556 and erected these extensive buildings 
at various periods between 1578 and 17 15. The Celetna ulice, which 
leads from the town hall to the limits of the old town contains at 
its extremity the so-called powder tower (prafna brdna). It occupies 
the spot where one of the old town gates was situated, and was built 
by King Vladislav in that elaborate style of architecture which is 
known as the style of Vladislav. The building was very skilfully 
restored in 1 880-1 883. The powder tower stands at the corner pf 
the Prikopy (in Ger. Graben) which with its continuations, the 
Ovocna ulice and the Ferdinandova ulice, is the most animated 
part of modern Prague. At the extreme end of the Ferdinandova 
ulice is the modern Bohemian national theatre. 

The " new town " of Prague, though not equal in interest to the 
11 old town," is also well worth notice. At the extremity of the 

Clace of Wenceslaus (Vaclavske* Namesti) is situated the handsome 
uilding that contains the collections and library of the Bohemian 
museum. The museum was opened by the Archduke Charles 
Louis of Austria on the 18th of May 1891. Of the many interesting 
churches in the " new town " the Karlov deserves special mention. 
It was built by Charles IV. in 1350 in the Gothic style, but was 
restored in the 18th century. The monastery^ that formerly ad- 
joined this church has been suppressed and its buildings are now used 
as a hospital. Near the Karlov church is the Karlovo Namesti 
(place of Charles), in which is situated the former town hall of the 
new town," from the windows of which the councillors were 
thrown at the beginning of the Hussite wars. The Vysehrad, now 
a part of Prague, adjoins the " new town." It has preserved 
but slight traces of its ancient splendour. It contains, however, the

PRAGUERIE, THE— PRAIRIE DU CHIEN 



Romanesque chapel of S Martin, the Church of SS Peter-and Paul, 
and .the adjoining cemetery where many of the leaders of the 
Bohemian national movement are buried. 

The districts of Prague situated on the left bank of the Vltava 
are connected with the other parts of the city by bridges, of which 
the oldest is the Karlovo most (bridge of Charles). The present 
structure was begun by Charles IV. in 1357, but in consequence of 
frequent storms and inundations it was only completed in 1503. 
The statues on the bridge are of an even later date. Not far from 
the bridge in the centre of the Mala strana is the monument to 
Radetzky, erected in 1858 out of captured Piedmontese cannon. 
Near here are the palaces of the governor of Bohemia and that in 
which the Bohemian diet (snStn) now meets. At the extreme end 
of the Mala strana is the extensive Strahov monastery, from the 
terraces of which the finest view of the city of Prague can be 
obtained. The monastery possesses one of the most valuable 
libraries in Prague and a small picture gallery. The church of the 
monastery contains the tomb of the famous General Pappenheim. 
In the Mala strana and the adjoining Hradcany are situated the 
winter residences of the wealthy Bohemian nobility. Of the many 
palaces, the Waldstein, Schwarzenberg — formerly Rosenberg — 
palaces, the two palaces of the counts Thun and that of Prince 
Lobkowitz are the most interesting, On the summit of the Hradcany 
is the vast palace of the ancient kings of Bohemia, which also contains 
the hall where the estates of Bohemia formerly met. During the 
Hussite wars most of the buildings on the Hradcany hill were 
destroyed, and a large part of the castle still known as the halls of 
Vladislav was rebuilt by the kings of that name. The handsome 
halls known as the Spanish and German halls were erected by 
Ferdinand I., and additions were made by other sovereigns also. 
The Hradcany was for a time the residence of Rudolph, crown 
prince of Austria, and it is also occupied by the emperor of Austria 
during his visits to Prague. Adjoining the Hradcany palace is the 
famed Cathedral of St Vitus, where the kings of Bohemia were 
crowned. The earliest church on this spot was built by St Wen- 
ceslaus, and the present building was begun by Charles IV. and has 
as yet remained unfinished. The cathedral contains the chapel 
of St Wenceslaus, where the insignia of the Bohemian kings are 
preserved, the tomb of St John of Nepomuk, and a monument to 
the Bohemian sovereigns who are buried here, the work of Colin 
of Malines. On the slope of the Hradcany hill are the ancient 
towers named Mikulka, Daliborka, the white tower and the 
black tower, which formed part of the fortified works erected by 
Ottakar II. (1253-1278). 

The suburbs of Prague contain few objects of- interest, but 
they are centres of the rapidly increasing trade and industry of 
Prague.

PRAGUERIE, THE, a revolt of the French nobility against 
King Charles VII. in 1440. It was so named because a similar 
rising had recently taken place in Prague, Bohemia, at that 
time closely associated with France through the house of 
Luxemburg, kings of Bohemia, and it was caused by the re- 
forms of Charles VII. at the close of the Hundred Years' War, by 
which he sought to lessen the anarchy in France. The attempt 
to reduce the brigand-soldiery, and especially the ordinances 
passed by the estates of Languedoil at Orleans in 1439, which 
not only gave the king an aid of 100,000 francs (an act which 
was later used by the king as though it were a perpetual grant 
and so freed him from that parliamentary control of the purse 
so important in England), but demanded as well royal nomina- 
tions to oflkerships in the army, marked a gain in the royal 
prerogative which the nobility resolved to challenge. The 
main instigator was Charles I., duke of Bourbon, who three 
years before had attempted a similar rising, and had been 
forced to ask pardon of the king. He and his bastard brother, 
Alexander, were joined by the former favourite, Georges de la 
Tremoille, John V., duke of Brittany, who allied himself with 
the English, the duke of Alencon, the count of Vendome, and 
captains of mercenaries like Antoine de Chabannes, or Jean de 
la Roche. The duke of Bourbon gained over to their side the 
dauphin Louis — afterwards Louis XI. — then sixteen years old, 
and proposed to set aside the king in his favour, making him 
regent. Louis was readily induced to rebel; but the country 
was saved from a serious civil war by the energy of the king's 
officers and the solid loyalty of his " good cities." The constable 
de Richemont marched with the king's troops into Poitou, his 
old battleground with Georges de la Tremoille, and in two months 
he had subdued the country. The royal artillery battered down 



the feudal strongholds. The dauphin and the duke of Alencon 
failed to bring about any sympathetic rising in Auvergne, and 
the Praguerie was over, except for some final pillaging and 
plundering in Saintonge and Poitou, which the royal army 
failed to prevent. Charles VII. then attempted to ensure 
the loyalty of the duke of Bourbon by the gift of a large pension, 
forgave all the rebellious gentry, and installed his son in Dau- 
phine (see Louis XI.). The ordinance of Orleans was enforced. 

PRAHRAN, a city of Bourke county, Victoria, Australia, 
3J m, by rail S.E. of Melbourne and suburban to it. Pop. 
(1901), 41,161. It is connected with Melbourne by cable tram 
over a fine iron girder bridge across the Yarra. Many of its 
streets are planted with trees and it has numerous handsome 
shops and villas. Prahran was proclaimed a city in 1879. 

PRAIRIE (adopted from the Fr. prairie, a meadow-tract. 
Late Lat. prataria, Lat. pratum, meadow), a level tract of grassy 
and treeless country, generally restricted to tracts so character- 
ized in the central parts of North America. In the United 
States the prairies may be taken to extend from southern 
Michigan and western Ohio over Illinois (especially designated 
the Prairie State), Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, and west of the Missouri to the foothills of the 
Rocky Mountains (see articles on the several states, and United 
States). In Canada they extend from the same mountains 
to a line somewhat to the east of Winnipeg. The word prairie 
is used in a large number of compounds referring to natural 
and other features, flora, fauna, &c, characteristic of the 
prairies. Examples are: prdirie-chicken or prairie-hen, a 
name for the pinnated grouse (Ctipidonia or Tympanacus 
cupido), also applied to Pedtoeceies phasinelhtSj the sharp-tailed 
grouse; prairie-dog, a rodent of the squirrel family, genus 
Cynomys, a gregarious burrowing animal, and other animals 
noticed below; prairie-schooner , a name for the covered wagons 
in which emigrants used to cross the plains; prairie-grass, &c. 

PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, a city and the county-seat of Crawford 
county, Wisconsin, U.S.A., on the east bank of the Mississippi 
river about 3 m. above the mouth of the Wisconsin, about 98 m. 
W. of Madison. Pop. (1890)3131; (1900) 3232; (1905)3179; 
(1910) 3149. It is served by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St 
Paul, and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railways. The 
city has a fine location, its natural attractiveness and mineral 
springs in the vicinity combining to make it a summer and 
health resort. It has an excellent artesian w T ater-supply. 
Among its buildings are the Crawford county court-house, the 
city hospital and a sanatorium. It is the seat of St Mary's 
Academy (1872; R.C.) for young women, and the College of the 
Sacred Heart (1880; R.C.) for men. Among the manufactures 
are beer, wagons, wool, and pearl buttons, and the city is a 
centre of the fresh-water pearl fisheries along the Mississippi. 
Prairie du Chien is one of the most interesting places, historically, 
in Wisconsin. The first white man known to have visited the 
site was Father Hennepin in 1680; later in the same year the 
trader Du Lhut (or Duluth) was here. In 1685 Nicholas Perrot, 
the French commandant in the West, built Fort St Nicholas 
near the site of the present city. After the close of the French 
and Indian War, British authorities assumed possession, but 
no garrison was regularly maintained. In 17 79-1 780 Prairie du 
Chien was the scene of plots and counterplots of American and 
British sympathizers and of the activities of Godefrey Linctot, 
the agent of George Rogers Clark. About 1780-1781 a permanent 
settlement began to grow up around the post. Prairie du 
Chien was formally surrendered in 1796 to the United States 
authorities under the- Jay treaty,' and by them Fort Shelby was 
erected. On the 17th of July 1814 a force of British, Canadians 
and Indians under Major William McKay captured the fort, 
and renamed it Fort McKay, but abandoned it in May 1815. 
In 1 8 16 Fort Crawford was erected — it was rebuilt on a different 
site in 1829 — and in 1820 one of the principal depots of the 
American Fur Company was established here. Here in 1S23 
Judge James Duane Doty (1 790-1865) opened the first United 
States court in what is now the state of Wisconsin. At the time 
of the Red Bird rising in 1827, Governor Lewis Cass of Michigan 



PRAIRIE-MARMOT— PRAKRIT

Territory made Prairie du Chien his temporary headquarters. 
During the Black Hawk War (1832) Zachary Taylor, then a 
lieutenant-colonel, was in command of Fort Crawford, and to 
him Black Hawk was entrusted after his capture. The Chicago, 
Milwaukee & St Paul railroad was completed to Prairie du 
Chien in 1857. The city was chartered in 1872. 

PRAIRIE-MARMOT, a zoological emendation for the Ameri- 
can name " prairie-dog," applied to a small North American 
rodent allied to the squirrels and marmots, and technically 
known as Cynomys ludoviclanus (sec Marmot). In a great 
degree prairie-marmots, of which there are several species in 
North America, ranging as far south as Mexico, are intermediate 
between marmots and sousliks (see Souslik), having the cheek- 
pouches much smaller than in the latter, and the first front-toe, 
which is rudimentary in marmots and sousliks, well developed. 
The cheek-teeth are more complex than those of marmots, and 
the two series converge behind. In their slender build and 
small size, prairie-marmots are much more like sousliks than 
marmots. In habits these rodents are very like marmots, 
the typical species inhabiting the open prairies, while the others 
are found in mountains. The prairie species (C. ludovicianus) 
makes a raised, funnel-shaped entrance to its burrow. All 
feed on the roots of grass; and when disturbed, like marmots, 
utter a whistling cry. Rattlesnakes, owls and weasels are 
commonly found in the burrows; but their presence is no indica- 
tion of the existence of a kind of " happy family " arrangement, 
the snakes, at any rate, preying on the young marmots. The 
hibernation of these rodents is only partial, and confined to 
seasons of intense cold. (See Rodentia.) 

PRAKRIT (prakrta, natural), a term applied to the ver- 
nacular languages of India as opposed to the literary Sanskrit 
{samskrta, purified). The place which the Prakrits occupy 
in regard to the Indo-European languages (q.v.), ancient 
and modern, is treated under that head. There were two main 
groups of ancient Indo-Aryan dialects, or Primary Prakrits, 
viz. the language of the Midland or Aryavarta, and that of what 
is called the Outer Band. The language of the Midland became 
the language of literature, and was crystallized in the shape of 
literary Sanskrit about 300 B.C. Beside it all the Primary 
Prakrits continued to develop under the usual laws of phonetics, 
and, as vernaculars, reached a secondary stage marked by a 
tendency to simplify harsh combinations of consonants and the 
broader diphthongs, the synthetic processes of declension and 
conjugation remaining as a whole unaltered. The process of 
development closely resembles that of old Italian from the 
Italic dialects of Latin times. It should be noted that although 
the literary dialect of the Midland became fixed, the vernacular 
of the same tract continued to develop along with the other 
Primary Prakrits, but owing to the existence of a literary 
standard by its side its development was to a certain extent 
retarded, so that it was left somewhat behind by its fellows in 
the race. 

The Secondary Prakrits, in their turn, received literary 
culture. In their earliest stage one of them became the sacred 
language of Buddhism, and under the name of Pah (q.v.) has 
been widely studied. In a still later stage several Secondary 
Prakrits became generally employed for a new literature, both 
sacred and profane. Not only were three of them used for 
the propagation of the Jaina religion (see Jains), but they were 
also dealt with as vehicles for independent secular works, 
besides being largely employed in the Indian drama. In the 
last-named B rah mans, heroes and people of high rank spoke in 
Sanskrit, while the other characters expressed themselves in 
some Secondary Prakrit according to nationality or profession. 
This later stage of the Secondary Prakrits is known as the 
Prakrit par excellence, and forms the main subject of the present 
article. A still further stage of development will also be dis- 
cussed, that of the ApabhrariiSa, or " corrupt language." The 
Prakrit par excellence, which will throughout the rest of this 
article be called simply " Prakrit," underwent the common fate 
of all Indian literary languages. In its turn it was fixed by 
grammarians, and as a literary language ceased to grow, while 



as a vernacular it went on in its own course. From the point 
of view of grammarians this further development was looked 
upon as corruption, and its result hence received the name of 
ApabhrathSa. Again in their turn the ApabhrathSas received 
literary cultivation and a stereotyped form, while as vernaculars 
they went on into the stage of the Tertiary Prakrits and become 
the modern Indo-Aryan languages. 

In the Prakrit stage of the Secondary Prakrits we see the 
same grouping as before — a Midland language, and the dialects 
of the Outer Band. The Prakrit of the Midland was known as 
Saurasenl, from Siirasena, the name of the country round 
Mathura (Muttra). It was the language of the territories having 
the Gangetic Doab for their centre. To the west it probably 
extended as far as the modern Lahore and to the east as far 
as the confluence of the Jumna and the Ganges. Conquests 
carried the language much further afield, so that it occupied 
not only Rajputana, but also Gujarat. As stated above, the 
development of Saurasenl was retarded by the influence of its 
great neighbour Sanskrit. Moreover, both being sprung from 
the same original — the Primary Prakrit of the Midland— its 
vocabulary, making allowances for phonetic changes, is the 
same as in that language. 

The Prakrits of the Outer Band, all more closely connected 
with each other than any one of them was to Saurasenl, were 
Magadhi, ArdhamagadhI, Maharastrl, and an unknown Prakrit 
of the North-west. Magadhi was spoken in the eastern half 
of the Gangetic plain. Its proper home was Magadha, the 
modern South Bihar, but it extended far beyond these limits 
at very early times. Judging from the modern vernaculars, 
its western limit must have been about the longitude of the 
city of Benares. Between it and Saurasenl (i.e. in the modern 
Oudh and the country to its south) lay ArdhamagadhI or " half- 
Magadhl." Maharastrl was the language of Maharastra, the 
great kingdom extending southwards from the river Nerbudda 
to the Kistna and sometimes including the southern part of the 
modern Bombay Presidency and Hyderabad. Its language 
therefore lay south of Saurasenl. West of Saurasenl, in the 
Western Punjab, there must have been another Prakrit of which 
we have no record, although we know a little about its later 
ApabhrathSa form. Here there were also speakers of PaisacI 
(see Indo-Aryan Languages), and the local Prakrit, if we are to 
judge from the modern Tertiary vernacular, was a mixed form of 
speech. We have a detailed description of only one ApabhramSa 
— the Nagara — the ApabkrariiSa of the Saurasenl spoken in 
the neighbourhood of Gujarat, and therefore somewhat mixed 
with M£hara§trl. We may, however, conclude that there was 
an ApabhramSa corresponding to each Prakrit, so that we have, 
in addition to Saurasena, a Magadha, an Ardhamagadha 
and a Mahara§tra ApabhrarhSa. Native writers describe more 
than one local ApabhratiiSa, of which we may mention VrSca^a, 
the ancient dialect of Sind. There were numerous Prakrit 
subdialects to which it is not necessary to refer. 

Of all these Prakrits, Maharastrl is that which is best known 
to us. It early obtained literary pre-eminence, and not only 
was the subject of long treatises by native grammarians, but 
became the language of lyric poetry and of the formal epic 
(kavya). Dramatic works have been written in it, and it was 
also the vehicle of many later scriptures of the Jaina religion. 
We also know a good deal about ArdhamagadhI, in which the 
older Jaina writings were composed. With Magadhi we have, 
unfortunately, only a partial acquaintance, derived from brief 
accounts by native grammarians and from short sentences 
scattered through the plays. We know something more about 
Saurasenl, for it is the usual prose dialect of the plays, and 
is also employed for the sacred writings of one of the Jaina sects. 

The materials extant for the study of the Prakrit are either 
native grammars or else literary works written in accord with 
the rules laid down therein. Originally real ver- i^ nsuazet 
naculars with tendencies towards certain phonetic 
changes, the dialects were taken in hand by grammatical 
systematizers, who pruned down what they thought was over- 
luxuriant growth, trained errant shoots in the way they thought 



252 



PRAKRIT 



they ought to have gone, and too often generalized tendencies 
into universal rules. Subsequent writers followed these rules 
and not the living speech, even though they were writing in 
what was meant to be a vernacular. Moreover, at an early 
date, the Prakrits, qua literary languages, began to lose their 
characteristics as local forms of speech. A writer composed 
in Maharastrl, not because it was his native language, but 
because it was the particular Prakrit employed for lyrics and 
in formal epics. In the same way, in dramatic literature, 
SaurasenI and Magadhi were put into the mouths of characters 
in particular walks in life, whatever the nationality of the 
dramatist might have been; There was thus a tendency for 
these literary Prakrits to adopt forms from the vernacular 
dialects of those who wrote them, and, en revancJie, for the very 
popular lyric poetry of Maharastrl to influence the local dialects 
of the most distant parts of India. On the other hand, although 
to a certain extent artificial, the literary Prakrits are all based 
on local vernaculars, a fact entirely borne out by a comparison 
with the modern Indian languages, which closely agree with 
them in their mutual points of difference. We now proceed to 
consider the general points in which the Prakrits differ from 
Sanskrit and from each other. The reader is throughout 
assumed to be familiar with the general outline of the article 
Sanskrit. 

[Contractions : Skr. = Sanskrit. Pr. = Prakrit. S. — SaurasenI. 
Mg. =MagadhI. AMg. = Ardhamagadhi. M. = Maharastrl. Ap. = 
Nagara Apabhramsa.] 

Vocabulary. — The vocabulary of S. is to all intents and purposes 
the same as that of Skr. In the languages of the Outer Band there 
are numerous provincial words (de& or deSya), the originals of which 
belonged to Primary Prakrits other than those of the Midland. 
In the Outer Band there is also a rich variety of grammatical forms, 
many of which are found in the Veda and not in classical Sanskrit, 
and some (e.g. Pr. -hi, Pali -dhi, Greek Si) which cannot be traced 
to any known Primary Prakrit form, but which must have existed 
in that stage and beyond it, back into Indo-European times. 

Phonetics. — The Skr. diphthongs e and o are treated in Pr. as pure 
vowelSi and may each be either long or short. At and au become 
either 5 and 3 or a'i and au respectively. The vowel t becomes a, i , 
or, under the influence of a neighbouring labial, w. Before two con- 
sonants an original long vowel becomes short, and i and u are 
(according to the grammarians) changed to e and o respectively. 
The last rule is an instance of grammarians* over-generalization, and 
is not universally true. Examples, Skr. marga-, Pr. magga-; Skr. 
sindura-, Pr. sendura-; Skr. puslaka-, Pr. potthaa-. Conversely, 
a short vowel before two consonants is lengthened on one of them 
being elided. Thus, Skr. tsvara-, Pr. issara~ or tsara-; Skr. jihva, 
Pr. jthd. In Ap. the quantity of vowels is very loosely observed. 

In all dialects n becomes n unless it is followed by a dental mute, 
but in Jaina works tin and initial n remain unchanged. Judging 
from modern vernaculars, the latter seems to have been the real 
state of affairs. In Me. j becomes y and r becomes /. Here also 
s and s become i, a peculiarity still preserved by the modern Bengali. 
Elsewhere i and j usually become s, but the change of a sibilant 
to h is not uncommon in the Outer Prakrits (even in Mg.), though 
rare in the more archaic S. 

Initial y becomes j except in Mg., in which, on the contrary, j 
becomes y. Subject to the foregoing general rules, all other initial 
consonants usually remain unchanged. As regards medial single 
consonants: — 

i. K y g, c, j f t t d and y are usually elided. As a hiatus is caused 
by the elision, a faintly sounded y (or in some cases v) is substituted 
for the elided consonant, though only written in Jaina MSS. Ex- 
amples: Skr. loka- % Pr. lo(y)a-; Pr. www = Skr. mata- y mada- % maya-, 
mr t ga or mrta-. The latter example illustrates the extraordinary 
confusion which results from the strict application of this rule of 
elision of medial consonants. Such a Prakrit would have failed 
in the main object of a .language — the connotation of distinct ideas 
by distinct sounds. To the present writer it seems impossible that 
such a language could ever have existed, and he is persuaded that 
the rule just given is merely another instance of grammarians* 
over-generalization. A rule has been made out of a tendency, 
and this tendency was evidently, first, to soften a hard letter, and 
then (but not necessarily) to elide it. We see this well illustrated 
by Apabhramia, in which k, t and p are usually preserved under 
the forms g, d and b. In the Outer Prakrits also k often becomes g, 
as in Skr. Irdvaka-, Jaina M. and AMg. savaga-, Mg. iavaga-. S. and 
Mg. always preserve a medial /, changing it to d; thus, Skr. gata-, 
S. Mg. gada-, elsewhere ga(y)a~. 

2. Kk t gh t th, dh, ph and bh similarly become h. Also, as above, 
§. and Mg. change th to dh. Th becomes tffe, and ph may become bh. 
The other aspirates (ch, jh,* #"), and also sometimes bh, remain 



unchanged. In Ap., as before, kh, th and ph are usually preserved 
in gh, dh and bh respectively. 

3. T becomes 4, 4 becomes / (often written /), which when doubled 
becomes dentalized to //, as in the case of the Jaina nn. P and b 
usually become v. The Outer languages often cerebralize dental 
sounds and change $ to /. 

4. JV, m, / and h remain unchanged. V disappears before u, 
but otherwise generally remains unchanged. In Ap. m may 
become a v nasalized by anundsika; thus, Skr. bhramara-, Ap. 
bhaVara-. 

Final consonants usually disappear altogether, except nasals, 
which become anusvara. Thus, Skr. samantat, phalam, Pr. samantd, 
phalath. 

The following rules will be found to include the great majority 
of possible cases of compound consonants. They show clearly the 
character of all] changes from Primary to Secondary Prakrit, viz. 
the substitution, mainly by a process of assimilation, of a slurred 
for a distinct pronunciation : — 

1. In Pr. a conjunct consonant cannot consist of more than two 
elements, and, except in Mg. and Ap., can only be a double consonant 
or a consonant preceded by a nasal, a consonant followed by r, or " 
one of the following : nh, nh, mh, Ih. The consonants r and h cannot 
be doubled. 

2. In Pr. the only conjuncts which can begin a word are nh, nh, 
mh, and Ih. If any other conjunct consonant be initial, the first 
member of the Pr. form of it is dropped. Thus, in Pr. kr becomes kk, 
and the Skr. akramati becomes Pr. akkamat. If we omit the 
initial preposition a- (Pr. a-), the kk becomes initial, and we have 
kamat, not *kkamai. Similarly, Skr. sthira- becomes Pr. thira- for 
*tthira-. 

3. L and v are elided when they stand first or last in a compound, 
and the remaining letter is doubled, if it admits of doubling. Thus, 
Skr. ulkd, Pr. ukkd; Skr. pakva, Pr. pakka-. The same rule is 
followed regarding r, but when it follows a consonant it is sometimes, 
especially in Ap., retained even when initial. Thus, Skr. arka- t 
Pr. akka; Skr. priya-, Pr. pia~ or (Ap.) pria-. 

4. M, n and y are elided when standing last in a compound, and 
the remaining letter is doubled ; thus, Skr. ras"mi-, Pr. rassi-. 

5. K, g, J, <}> t, d, p, s* t $ and s are elided when standing first in a 
compound, and the remaining letter is doubled as before; thus, 
Skr. bhakta-, Pr. bhatta-\ Skr. skhalita-, Pr. khalia- for *kkhalia~ 
(sec rule 2). 

6. The above rules hold in the order given above ; that is to say, 
rule 3 holds in preference to rules 4 and 5, and rule 4 in preference 
to rule 5. Thus, in the Skr. compound kr, the r is elided under rule 3, 
and not the k under rule 5, so that the Pr. form is kk* 

7. Special Rules for Mg. — In this form of Pr. there are several 
peculiar changes, by, rj, ry, all become yy; ny, ny, jfi, nj become 
nn\ medial cch becomes ic, ((, s(, s(h become sf; and rth, sth become 
st. Other changes also occur, besides dialectic variations of those 
given above. 

Declension. — Pr. has preserved the three genders of Skr., but has 
lost the dual number. As arule, the gender of a noun follows that 
of the Skr. original, though in AMg. there is already a tendency to 
substitute the masculine for the neuter, and in Ap. these two genders 
are frequently confused, if the distinction is not altogether neglected. 
In the formation of cases, the phonetic rules just given are fully 
applied, but there are also other deviations from the Skr. original. 
The consonantal stems which form an important part of Skr. declen- 
sion are frequently given vocalic endings, and there is a general 
tendency to assimilate their declension to that oi a-bases, corre- 
sponding to the first and second declensions in Latin. This tendency 
is strongly helped by the free use of pleonastic suffixes ending in a, 
which are added to the base without affecting its meaning. Of 
these the most common are ~ka-, -4a 7f and -alia-, -i7/a- or -ulla-. 
The first of these was also very common in Skr., but its use became 
much extended in Pr. In accordance with the general rule, the k is 
liable to elision; thus, Skr. ghota-ka-, Pr. ghoda-a-. It may even 
be doubled, as in Skr. bahu- y much, Pr. bahu-a-a-, for bahu-ka-ka-. 
-^a- is confined to Ap., and may be used alone or together with the 
other two, as in Skr bdhubala-, strength of arm, Ap. bahubal-ulla- 
a*a-(k)a-. Ilia- is most common in the Outer languages, and especi- 
ally so in AMg. and M.; thus, Skr. pura- % M. pur-Ma-. 

All the Skr. cases are preserved except the dative, which has 
altogether disappeared in the Midland, but has survived in the singu- 
lar number in the Outer languages. Everywhere the genitive can be 
employed in its place.- Most of the case-forms are derived from 
Sanskrit according to the phonetic rules, but Ap. has a number 
of dialectic forms which cannot be referred to that language (cf. 
the remarks above about -hi =61). It also rarely distinguishes 
between the nominative and the accusative. As an example, we 
may give the commoner forms of the declension of the Skr. putra, Pr. 
putta-, a son (see next page). It should be understood that numerous 
other forms were also in use, but the ones given here are selected 
because they are both common and typical. 

The declension of neuter a-bases closely resembles the above, 
differing only in the nominative and accusative singular and plural. 
Ap. has almost lost the neuter termination in the singular. Feminine 
a-stems are declined on the same lines, but the cases have run more 
into each other, the instrumental, genitive^ and locative singular 



PRAKRIT 



253 



being identical in form. Very similarly arc declined the bases 
ending in other vowels. The few still ending in consonants and 
which have not become merged in the a-dcclcnsion, present numerous 
apparent irregularities, due to the inevitable phonetic changes, 
which must be learned from the textbooks.

All the Skr. pronouns appear in Pr., but olten in extremely 
abraded shapes. It would, for instance, be difficult to recognize 
the Skr. tvdm in the Ap. pax. There is also a, most luxuriant growth 
of by-forms, the genitive plural of the pronoun of the second person 
being, e.g., represented by no less than twenty-five different words 
in M. alone. We also find forms which have no original in classical 
Skr. Thus, jn that language, the pronoun sa-, he, is only used in 
the nominative singular of two genders, but occurs also in other 
cases in Pr. 

Conjugation. — The Pr. verb shows even more 
decay than does the noun. With a few isolated 
exceptions, all trace of the second, or consonantal, 
conjugation of Skr. has disappeared, and (much 
as has happened in the case of nouns) all verbs are 
now conjugated after the analogy of the a-conjuga- 
tion. This a-conjugation, on the other hand, falls 
into two classes, the first being the a-conjuga- 
tion proper, and the second the ^-conjugation, 
in which the e represents the aya of the Skr. 
10th class and of causal and denominative verbs. 
The dtmanepada voice of Skr. has practically 
disappeared in the Midland, and even in the Outer languages it is 
not common. The present participle is the only form which has 
everywhere survived. The other forms are supplied by the paras- 
maipada. All the past^ tenses (imperfect, perfect and aorists) have 
fallen into disuse, leaving only a few sporadic remains, their place 
being supplied, as in the case of the tertiary vernaculars, by the 
participles, with or without auxiliary verbs. The present tense 
of the verb substantive has survived from Skr., but it is usual 
to employ atthi ( — Skr. asti) for both numbers and all persons of 
the present, and dsi {-dslt) for both numbers and all persons of 
the past. It is interesting to note that the latter has survived in 
the modern Panjabi si, was, in which language it is universally, 
but wrongly, described as a feminine. Another verb substantive 
(Skr. V bhu) has also survived, generally in the form hoi or huvai 
for bhavati. In AMg. and M. we also have bhaval pretty frequently, 
and the same form also occurs, but less often, in S. and Mg. Its 
usual past participle is hua- or Mg. huda-, S. bhiida-. The forms 
are given here as they are important when the history of the 
Tertiary Prakrits comes under consideration. These two verbs 
substantive make periphrastic tenses with other participles, and, 
in the case of the past participles and gerundives of transitive verbs 
(both of which are passive in signification), the agent or subject is put 
into the instrumental case, the participle being used either personally 
or impersonally, as in the tertiary languages. Thus, tena girivaro 
ditfho, by him a mountain was seen, i.e. he saw a mountain; tena 
paiivannam, it was acknowledged by him, he acknowledged. The 
gerundive, or future passive participle, is also used impersonally 
in the case of intransitive verbs, as in duram gantawam, it is to be 
gone far, we must go far. 

Besides the participles, the infinitive and the indeclinable parti- 
ciple (gerund) have also survived. So also the passive voice, con- 
jugated in thesamc tenses as the active, and generally with paras- 
maipada terminations. The causal has been already mentioned. 
There are also numerous denominative verbs (many of them onoma- 
topoeic), and a good supply of examples of frequentative and 
desiderativc bases, mostly formed, with the necessary phonetic 
modifications, as in Skr. The present participle in the parasmaipada 
ends in -anta- (-enta-), declined according to the a-declension, and 
in the dtmanepada in -mana~. The termination -(i)ta- of the Skr. 



past participle passive has survived under the form -ta-. Many 
direct representatives of Skr. participles in -to- (without the i) and 
-na- also appear. Thus, Skr. drj(ta~, Pr. diffha-, seen; Skr. lagna-, 
Pr. lagga-, attached. As usual there is a tendency to simplification, 
and the termination ia is commonly added to the Pr. present base, 

instead of following Skr. analogy. 
Thus, not only have we tatta- formed 
directly from the Skr. tapta-, but wc 
have also tavia- from the Pr. present 
stem tav-ai ( — Skr. tapatt), he is hot. 
All the three forms of the future 
passive participle or gerundive, in 
-tavya-, -anlya- and -yo-, have sur- 
vived. The infinitive has survived, not 
only with the form corresponding to 
the classical Sanskrit termination 
-turn, but also with several old Vedic 
forms. The same is the case with 
the gerund, in which both the 
classical forms in -tvd and -{f)ya 
have survived, but with the Joss of 
the distinctive use which obtained in 
Sanskrit. Besides these there are 
also survivals of Vedic forms, and 
even of Primary Prakrit forms not 
found in the Veda. .The passive is 
generally formed by adding -jja or, 
in §. and Mg., -la-, to the root or, 
more often, to the present stem. 
Thus, M. pucchijjal or S. pucchtadi, he is being asked. 

The following are therefore the only tenses which are fully 
conjugated in Pr. : the present, the imperative, the future and 
the optative. Except in Ap., the personal terminations in general 
correspond to the Skr. ones, but in Ap. there are some forms which 
probably go back to unrecorded Primary Prakrits and have not as 
yet been explained. As an example we take the conjugation of 
the base puccha-, ask (Skr. prcchati), in the present tense.

The imperative similarly follows the Skr. imperative. The S. 
second person singular is generally puccha, while the Outer languages 
often have a form corresponding to pucchehi. The base of the 
optative is generally formed by adding -ejja- in the Outer languages 
and -ea- in S. ; thus, S. puccheam, others pucchejjdmi, &c, may 1 
ask.^ The Skr. future termination -isya- is represented by -issa- 
or -ihi-; thus, pucchissdmi or pucchihimx, I shall ask. 

Prakrit Literature. — The great mass of Prakrit literature 
is devoted to the Jaina religion, and, so far as it is known, is 
described under the head of Jains. Here it is utenture . 
sufficient to state that the oldest Jaina sutras were 
in Ardhamagadhi, while the non-canonical books of the Svetam- 
bara sect were in a form of Maharastri, and the canon of the 
Digambaras appears to have been in a form of N Sauraseni. 
Besides these religious works, Prakrit, also appears in secular 
literature. In artificial lyric poetry it is pre-eminent. The 
most admired work is the Sattasal (SaptaSaptika) , compiled 
at some time between the 3rd and 7th centuries a.d. by 
Hala. The grace and poetry of this collection, in which art 
most happily succeeds in concealing art, has rarely been 
exceeded in literature of its kind. It has had numerous 
imitators, both in Sanskrit and in the modern vernaculars, the 
most famous of which is the Satsal of BihSri L&I (17th century 
a.d.). Hala's work is important, not only on its own account, 
but also as showing the existence of a large Prakrit literature at 
the time when it was compiled. Most of this is now lost. There 
are some scholars (including the present writer) who believe that 
Sanskrit literature owes more than is generally admitted to 
works in the vernacular, and that even the MahSbharata first 
took its form as a folk-epic in an early Prakrit, and was sub- 
sequently translated into Sanskrit, in which language it was 
further manipulated, added to, and received its final shape. 
In literary Prakrit we have two important specimens of formal 



254 



PRAM— PRATINCOLE 



epic poetry — the Ravanavaha or Setubandha (attributed to 
Pravarasena, before a.d. 700), dealing with the subject of the 
Rd?ndyana y and the Gau4avaha of Vakpati (7th-8th century 
A.D.), celebrating the conquest of Bengal by Yasovarman, king 
of Kanauj. Reference must also be made to the Kumdrapdla- 
carita, the title of the last eight cantos of the huge DvydSraya 
Mahdkdvya of Hemacandra (a.d. 1150). The whole work was 
written to serve as a series of illustrations to the author's Sanskrit 
and Prakrit grammar, the Siddha-hemacandra. The last eight 
cantos are in Prakrit, and illustrate the rules of the corresponding 
portion of his work. Its hero is Kumara-pala of Anhilvada. 
Dramatic literature has also an admired example in the Karpura- 
manjari (" Camphor-cluster," the name of the heroine) by 
Raja-sekhara (a.d. 900), an amusing comedy of intrigue. An 
important source of our knowledge of Prakrit, and especially 
of dialectic Prakrit, is the Sanskrit drama. It has already been 
pointed out that in works of this class many of the characters 
speak in Prakrit, different dialects being employed for different 
purposes. Generally speaking, SaurasenI is employed for 
prose and Maharastri (the language of lyric poetry) for the 
songs, but special characters also speak special dialects according 
to their supposed nationality or profession. In India there is 
nothing extraordinary in such a polyglot medley. It is paralleled 
by the conditions of any large house in Bengal at the present 
day, in which there are people from every part of India, each 
of whom speaks his own language and is understood by the 
others, though none of them attempts to speak what is not 
his mother tongue. The result is that in the Sanskrit drama 
we have a valuable reflection of the local dialects. It is some- 
what distorted, for the authors wrote according to the rules 
laid down by technical handbooks, and the dialects which 
they employed were, in the case of the later writers, as dead as 
Sanskrit. But nevertheless, if not an absolutely true representa- 
tion, it is founded on the truth, and it is almost our only source 
of information as to the condition of the Indian vernaculars in 
the first five centuries a.d. The drama which gives the best 
examples of these dialects is the M^cchakatikd. For further 
particulars regarding the Sanskrit drama, reference should be 
made to the article Sanskrit. 

Authorities. — The father of Prakrit philology was Ch. Lassen, 
the author of the Institutiones linguae pracriheae (Bonn, 1837). 
This famous work, a wonderful product ot the learning of the time, 
is now out of date, and has been definitely superseded by R. Pischel's 
Grammatik der Prakritsprachen (Strasburg, 1900). As an introduc- 
tion to the study of the language, the best work is H. Jacobi's 
Ausgewahlte Erzahlungen in Mdhdrdshtri zur Einfiihrung in das 
Studium des Prdkrit, Grammatik, Text t Worterbuch (Leipzig, 1886). 
The best editions of the native grammars are E. B. Co well's 
of Vararuci's Prdkrta-prakds'a (London, 1868), R. Pischel's of 
Hemacandra (Halle, 1877, 1889) [see above], and E. Hultzsch's of 
Simharaja's Prakrtarupavatara (London, 1909). For Desya words, 
see Pischel's The Dettndmamdld of Hemachandra (Bombay, 1880). 
For Apabhramia, in addition to his edition of Hemacandra *s grammar,

PRAM (Du. praam) j the name of a flat-bottomed boat or 
barge used as a " lighter " for discharging and loading cargo 
in the ports of the Baltic and North Sea. The word, which is 
common in various forms to all the languages bordering on those 
seas, is originally Slavonic; its ultimate 'etymology connects it 
with the words found in all Indo-European languages which are 
to be traced to the root par-, to go through, travel; cf. " fare," 
" ferry," " far," Gr. 7r6pos, way, Lat. portare, carry, &c. 



PRANTL, KARL VON (1820-1888), German philosopher, was 
born at Landsberg on the Lech on the 28th of January 1820, and 
died on the 14th of September 1888 at Oberstdorf. In 1843 he 
became doctor of philosophy at Munich Observatory, where 
he was made professor in 1859. He was also a member of the 
Academies of Berlin and Munich. Strongly in agreement 
with the Hegelian tradition, he defended and amplified it in 
Die gegenwartige Attfgabe der Philosophie (1852) and Verstehen 
and Beurteilen (1877). * n these works he emphasized the 
identity of the subjective and the objective for consciousness, 
and the fact that the perception of this unity is peculiar to man. 
He is more important, however, as a commentator and scholar, 
and made valuable contributions to the study of Aristotle. He 
published Aristoteles iiber die Farben (1849), Aristoteles* acht 
Bucher der Physik (1857), and numerous minor articles on 
smaller points, such as the authenticity of the thirty-eight books 
of the Problems. The work by which he is best known is the 
Geschichle der Logik im Abendland (Leipzig, 1855-1870). Chr. 
Sigwart, in the preface to the first edition of his Logic, makes 
" special mention " of the assistance he obtained from this 
book. 

PRATI, GIOVANNI (1815-1884), Italian poet, was born at 
Dasindo and educated in law at Padua. Adopting a literary 
career, he was inspired by anti-Austrian feeling and devotion 
to the royal house of Savoy, and in early life his combination of 
a sympathy for national independence with monarchical senti- 
ments brought him into trouble in both quarters, Guerrazzi 
expelling him from Tuscany in 1849 for his praise of Carlo 
Alberto. In 1862 he was elected a deputy to the Italian parlia- 
ment, and in 1876 a senator. He died at Rome on the 9th 
of May 1884. Prati was a prolific poet, his volumes of verse 
ranging from his romantic narrative Ermenegarda (1841) to the 
lyrics collected in Psiche (1875) and I side (1878). His Opere 
varie were published in five volumes in 1875, and a selection 
in one volume in 1892. 

PRATINAS (the quantity of the second vowel is doubtful), 
one of the oldest tragic poets of Athens, was a native of Phlius 
in Peloponnesus. About 500 B.C. be competed with Choerilus 
and Aeschylus, when the latter made his first appearance as a 
writer for the stage. Pratinas was also the introducer of satyric 
dramas as a species of entertainment distinct from tragedy, in 
which the rustic merry-makings and the extravagant dances of 
the satyrs were retained. The associations of his home, not 
far from Corinth, where Arion was said to have established the 
cyclic choruses of satyrs, may account for his preference for this 
kind of drama. Pratinas was also a writer of dithyrambs and 
the choral odes called hyporckemata (a considerable fragment 
of one of these is preserved in Athenaeus xiv. 617). It is 
related that, during the performance of one of his plays, the 
scaffolding of the wooden stage gave way, in consequence of 
which the Athenians built a theatre of stone; but recent excava- 
tions make it doubtful whether a stone theatre existed in Athens 
at so early a date. A monument was erected by the inhabitants 
of Phlius in honour of Pratinas's son Aristias, who, with his 
father, enjoyed the reputation of excelling all, with the exception 
of Aeschylus, in the composition of satyric dramas, one of 
which was called Cyclops.

PRATINCOLE, a word apparently invented by J. Latham 
(Synopsis, v. 222), being the English rendering of Pratincola, 
applied in 1756 by P. Kramer (Elenchus, p. 381) to a bird which 
had hitherto received no definite name, though it had long before 
been described and even recognizably figured by Aldrovandus 
(Ornithologia, xvhV 9) under the vague designation of " hirnndo 
marina." It is the Glareola pratincola of modern ornithologists, 
forming the type of a genus Glareola, founded by M. J. Brisson 
in 1760, belonging to the group Limicolae, and constituting to- 
gether with the coursers (Cursor his) a separate family, Glareolidae. 
The pratincoles, of which some eight or nine species have been 
described, are all small birds, slenderly built and mostly delicately 
coloured, with a short stout bill, a wide gape, long pointed wings,

and a tail more or less forked. In some of their habits they arc 
thoroughly plover-like, running very swiftly and breeding on 
the ground, but on the wing they have much the appearance 
of swallows, and, like them, feed, at least partly, while flying. 1 
The ordinary pratincole of Europe, G. pratincola, breeds abun- 
dantly in many parts of Spain, Barbary and Sicily, along the 
valley of the Danube, and in southern Russia, while owing to 
its great powers of flight it frequently wanders far from its home, 
and more than a score of examples have been recorded as occur- 
ring in the British Islands. In the south-east of Europe a second 
and closely-allied species, G. nordmanni or G. mclanoptera, 
which has black instead of chestnut inner wing-coverts, accom- 
panies or, farther to the eastward, replaces it; and in its turn 
it is replaced in India, China and Australia by G. oriental is, 
Australia also possesses another species, G. grallaria, remarkable 
for the great length of its wings and much longer legs, while its 
tail is scarcely forked — peculiarities that have led to its being 
considered the type of a distinct genus or sub-genus Stiltia. 
Two species, G. lactea and G. cinerea, from India and Africa 
respectively, seem by their pale coloration to be desert forms, 
and they are the smallest of this curious little group. The 
species whose mode of nidification is known lay either two 
or three eggs, stone-coloured, blotched, spotted, and streaked 
with black or brownish-grey. The young when hatched are 
clothed in down and are able to run at once — just as are young 
plovers. (A. N.) 

PRATO, a town and episcopal see of Tuscany, Italy, in the 
province of Florence, 11 m. by rail N.W. of Florence, 207 ft. 
above sea-level. Pop. (1906), 20,197 (town); 55,298 (com- 
mune). It is situated on the Bisenzio, and is dominated by a 
medieval castle and surrounded by walls of the nth and 14th 
centuries. The cathedral of St Stephen was begun in the 12th 
century in the Tuscan Romanesque style; to this period belongs 
the narrow nave with its wide arches; the raised transepts and 
the chapels were added by Giovanni Pisano in 1317-1320; the 
campanile dates from 1340 (it is a much smaller and less elabo- 
rate version of Giotto's campanile at Florence), while the facade, 
also of alternate white sandstone and green serpentine, belongs 
to 1413. It has a fine doorway with a bas-relief by Andrea 
della Robbia over it; but the most striking external feature is 
the lovely open-air pulpit at an angle of the building, erected 
by Donatello and Michelozzo for displaying to the people without 
risk the Virgin's girdle, brought from the Holy Land by a knight 
of Prato in 1130. The pulpit itself has beautiful reliefs of 
dancing children; beneath it is a splendid bronze capital. The 
contract was given out in 1428, but the work was seriously begun 
only in 1434 and finished in 1438. The Chapel of the Girdle 
has good frescoes by Agnolo Gaddi (1365), a statue of the Virgin 
by Giovanni Pisano, and a handsome bronze open-work screen. 
The frescoes in the choir, with scenes from the life of St John 
the Baptist and St Stephen, are by Fra Filippo Lippi (1456-1466) 
and are his best work; the dance of Salome and the lying in state 
of St Stephen are the finest of the series. Among other works 
of art may be mentioned the clay statue of the Madonna dell' 
Ulivo by Benedetto da Maiano. The massive old Palazzo 
Pretorio (13th century) has been somewhat modified in details; 
the adjacent Palazzo Comunalc contains a small picture gallery 

1 This combination of characters for many years led systematizers 
astray, though some of them were from the first correct in their 
notions as to the Pratincole's position. Linnaeus, even in his latest 
publication, placed it in the genus Hirundo; but the interleaved and 
annotated copies of his Systema naturae in the Linnean Society's 
library show the species marked for separation and insertion in the 
Order Gr allot — Pratincola trachelia bein£ the name by which he had 
meant to designate it in any future edition. He seems to have been 
induced to this change of view mainly through a specimen of the bird 
sent to him by John White, the brother of Gilbert White; but the 
opinion published in 1769 by Scopoli {Ann. J. hist, naturalise p. 1 10) 
had doubtless contributed thereto, though the earlier judgment to 
the same effect of Brisson, as mentioned above, had been disregarded. 
Different erroneous assignments of the form have been made even 
by recent authors, who neglected the clear evidence afforded by the 
internal structure of the Pratincole. For instance, Sundevall in 
1873 (Tcntamcn, p. 86) placed Glareola among the Caprimtdgidae, 
a position which osteology shows cannot be maintained for a moment. 



with works by Filippo and Filippino Lippi. A beautiful 
Madonna by the latter (1497) is in a small street shrine at the 
corner of the Via S. Margherita. The Church of S. Domcnico 
is a Gothic edifice of 1281; that of S. Francesco has an almost 
Renaissance facade, fine cloisters with a good 15th-century 
tomb, and a chapter-house with Giottesque frescoes. The 
Madonna del Buon Consiglio has some good reliefs by Andrea 
della Robbia, by whom is also the beautiful frieze in the Madonna 
delle Carceri. This church, by Giuliano da SangaUo (1485-1491), 
is a Greek cross, with barrel vaults over the arms, and a dome; 
it is a fine work, and the decoration of the exterior in marble 
of different colours (unfinished) is of a, noble simplicity. Some 
remains exist of the 13th-century fortress, and the large Piazza 
Mercatalc is picturesque. The works of art visible in Prato are 
due, as will be seen, entirely to Florentine artists. As a whole 
the town has a somewhat modern aspect. The industries of 
Prato embrace the manufacture of woollens (the most important), 
straw-plaiting, biscuits, hats, macaroni, candles, silk, olive 
oil, clothing and furniture, also copper and iron works, and 
printing. 

Prato is said to be first mentioned by name in 1107, but the 
cathedral appears as early as 1048 as the parish church of Borgo 
Cornio or Santo Stefano. It was subject to the Alberti until 1180, 
and was then under the Imperial supremacy. It appears to have 
freed itself from this at the end of the 13th century. In 1313 the 
town acknowledged the authority of Robert, king of Naples, and in 
1350 Niccola Acciajoli, seneschal of Joanna, sold it to the Florentines 
for 17,500 florins of gold. In 1512 it was sacked by the Spaniards 
under General Cardona. In 1653 it obtained the rank of city.

PRATT, ORSON (1811-1881), Mormon apostle, was born of 
humble parents at Hartford, New York. In 1830 he joined the 
Mormon Church, becoming a member of its council of twelve 
in 1834 and one of its twelve apostles in 1835. Pratt was also 
a mathematician of some note. He was professor of mathematics 
in the university of Deseret and wrote several books on this 
subject, these including Cubic a)td Biquadratic Equations (1866). 
He was a member, and several times speaker, of the Utah 
House of Representatives. Among his writings may be mentioned 
Key to the Universe (1866), and The Bible and Polygamy (1870). 

PRAWN, the name of an edible large shrimp-like crustacean 
in Great Britain usually apph'ed to Leander serratus (see Shrimp). 
The word is in M. Eng. prayne or prane, and no cognate forms are 
found in any other languages. It has been often referred to 
the Lat. perna, a ham-shaped shellfish, but this is due to Florio, 
who by a mistake glosses parnocchie f prawne-fishes or shrimps. 
The 0. Ital. perna and pemocchia meant a shellfish which yielded 
" nacre " or mother-of-pearl. 

PRAXIAS and ANDROSTHENES, Greek sculptors, who are 
said by Pausanias (x. 19, 4) to have executed the pediments of 
the temple of Apollo at Delphi. Both were Athenians; Praxias 
a pupil of Calami's. The statement raises historic difficulties, 
as, according to the leaders of the recent French excavations at 
Delphi, the temple of Apollo was destroyed about 373 B.C. and 
rebuilt by 339 B.C., a date which seems too late for the lifetime 
of a pupil of Calamis. In any case no fragments of the pedi- 
ments of this later temple have been found, and it has been 
suggested that they were removed bodily to Rome. 

PR AX ILL A, of Sicyon, Greek lyric poetess, one of the so-called 
nine " lyric " Muses, flourished about 450 B.C. According to 
Athenaeus (xv. 694), she was famous as a composer of scolia 
(short lyrical poems sung after dinner), which were considered 
equal to those of Alcaeus and Anacreon. She also wrote 
dithyrambs and hymns, chiefly on mystic and mythological 
subjects, genealogies, and the love-stories of the gods and heroes. 
A dactylic metre was also called by her name.

PRAXITELES, of Athens, the son of Cephissodotus, the 
greatest of the Attic sculptors of the 4th century B.C., who has 
left an imperishable mark on the history of art. It has been 
maintained by some writers that there were two sculptors of 
the name, one a contemporary of Pheidias, the other, more

PRAYER 



celebrated, of two generations later. This duplication is de- 
fended in Furtwangler's Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture (pp. 99, 
102, seq.) but on insufficient grounds. There is, however, no 
reason why the great Praxiteles should not have had a grand- 
father of the same name: all that we can say is that at present 
we have no certain evidence that this was the case. 

Though Praxiteles may be considered as in some ways well 
known to us, yet we have no means for fixing his date accurately. 
It seems clear that he was no longer working in the time of 
Alexander the Great, or that king would have employed 
him. Pliny's date, 364 B.C., is probably that of one of his most 
noted works. 

Our knowledge of Praxiteles has received a great addition, 
and has been placed on a satisfactory basis, by the discovery 
at Olympia in 1877 of his statue of Hermes bearing the infant 
Dionysus, a statue which has become famous throughout the 
world (Greek Art, fig. 43 and Plate VI. fig. 82). Hermes is 
represented as in the act of carrying the child Dionysus to the 
nymphs who were charged with his rearing. He pauses on the 
way, and holds out to the child a bunch of grapes to excite his 
desire. The young child can hardly be regarded as a success; 
he is not really childlike. But the figure of the Hermes, full 
and solid without being fleshy, at once strong and active, is a 
masterpiece, and the play of surface is astonishing. In the head 
we have a remarkably rounded and intelligent shape, and the 
face expresses the perfection of health and enjoyment. 

This statue must for the future be our best evidence for the 
style of Praxiteles. It altogether confirms and interprets the 
statements as to Praxiteles made by Pliny and other ancient 
critics. Gracefulness in repose, and an indefinable charm are 
also the attributes of works in our museums which appear to 
be copies of statues by Praxiteles. Perhaps the most notable 
of these are the Apollo Sauroctonus, or the lizard-slayer, a youth 
leaning against a tree and idly striking with an arrow at a lizard, 
and the Aphrodite at the bath (Greek Art, Plate V., fig. 71) 
of the Vatican, which is a copy of the statue made by Praxiteles 
for the people of Cnidus, and by them valued so highly that 
they refused to sel\ it to King Nicomedes, who was willing in 
return to discharge the whole debt of the city, which, says Pliny, 
was enormous. 

The Satyr of the Capitol at Rome has commonly been regarded 
as a copy of one of the Satyrs of Praxiteles; but we cannot 
identify it in the list of his works. Moreover, the style is hard 
and poor; a far superior replica exists in a torso in the 
Louvre. The attitude and character of the work are certainly 
of Praxitelean school. 

Excavations at Mantineia in Arcadia have brought to light 
the basis of a group of Leto Apollo and Artemis by Praxiteles. 
This basis was doubtless not the work of the. great sculptor him- 
self, but of one of his assistants. Nevertheless it is pleasing 
and historically valuable. Pausanias (viii. 9, 1) thus describes 
the base, " on the base which supports the statues there are 
sculptured the Muses and Marsyas playing the flutes." Three 
slabs which have survived represent Apollo, Marsyas, a slave, 
and six of the Muses, the slab which held the other three having 
disappeared. 

A head of Aphrodite at Pet worth in England, and a head of 
Hermes in the British Museum (Aberdeen Hermes), have lately 
been claimed by competent authorities as actual works of 
Praxiteles. Both are charming works, but rather by the suc- 
cessors of Praxiteles than by himself. 

Besides these works, connected with Praxiteles on definite 
evidence, there are in our museums works without number of 
the Roman age, statues of Hermes, of Dionysus, of Aphrodite, 
of Satyrs and Nymphs and the like, in which a varied amount 
of Praxitelean style may be discerned. Four points of composi- 
tion may be mentioned, which appear to be in origin Praxitelean: 
(1) 'a very flexible line divides the figures if drawn down the 
midst from top to bottom; they all tend to lounging; (2) they 
are adapted to front and back view rather than to being seen 
from one side or the other; (3) trees, drapery and the like are 
used for supports to the marble figures, and included in the 



design, instead of being extraneous to it; (4) the faces are 
presented in three-quarter view. 

The subjects chosen by Praxiteles were either human beings 
or the less elderly and dignified deities. It is Apollo, Hermes 
and Aphrodite who attract him rather than Zeus, Poseidon 
or Athena. And in his hands the deities sink to .the human 
level, or, indeed, sometimes almost below it. They have grace 
and charm in a supreme degree, but the element of awe and 
reverence is wanting. 

Praxiteles and his school worked almost entirely in marble. 
At the time the marble quarries of Paros were at their best; 
nor could any marble be finer for the purposes of the sculptor 
than that of which the Hermes is made. Some of the statues 
of Praxiteles were coloured by the painter Nicias, and in the 
opinion of the sculptor they gained greatly by this treatment. 

(P. G.) 

PRAYER (from Lat. precari, entreat; Ital. pregaria, Fr. 
priere), a term used generally for any humble petition, but more 
technically, in religion, for that mode of addressing a divine 
or sacred power in which there predominates the mood and 
intention of reverent entreaty. 

Prayer and its Congeners. — Prayer in the latter sense is a 
characteristic feature of the higher religions, and we might even 
say that Christianity or Mahommedanism, ritually viewed, is 
in its inmost essence a service of prayer. At all stages of 
religious development, however, and more especially in the case 
of the more primitive types of cult, prayer as thus understood 
occurs together with, and shades off into, other varieties of 
observance that bear obvious marks of belonging to the same 
family. 

Confining ourselves for the moment to forms of explicit address, 
we may group these under three categories according as the 
power addressed is conceived by the applicant to be on a higher, 
or on much the same, or on a lower plane of dignity and authority 
as compared with himself. (1) Only if the deity be regarded 
as altogether superior is there room for prayer proper, that is, 
reverent entreaty. Of this we may perhaps roughly distinguish 
a higher and a lower type, according as there is either complete 
confidence in the divine benevolence and justice, or a disposition 
to suppose a certain arbitrariness or at any rate condition- 
ally to attach to the granting of requests. In the first case 
prayer will be accompanied with disinterested homage, praise 
and thankgiving, and will in fact, tend to lose its distinctive 
character of entreaty or petition, passing into a mystic commun- 
ing or converse with God. In the second case it will be supported 
by pleading, involving on the one hand self-abasement, with 
confession of sins and promises of repentance and reform, or 
on the other hand self-justification, in the shape of the expression 
of faith and recitation of past services, together with reminders 
of previous favour shown. (2) If, however, the worshipper place 
his god on a level with himself, so far at any rate as to make 
him to some extent dependent on the service man contracts 
to render him, then genuine prayer tends to be replaced by a 
mere bargaining, often conjoined with flattery and with insincere 
promises. This spirit of do tit des will be found to go closely 
with the gift-theory of sacrifice, and to be especially character- 
istic of those religions of middle, grade that are given over to 
sacrificial worship as conducted in temples and by means of 
organized priesthoods. Not but what, when the high gods 
are kind for a consideration, the lower deities will likewise be 
found addicted -to such commerce; thus in India the hedge-priest 
and his familiar will bandy conditions in spirited dialogue audible 
to the multitude (cf. W. Crooke, Things Indian, s.v. " Demon- 
ology," pp. 132, 134). (3) Lastly, the degree of dependency on 
human goodwill attributed to the power addressed may be so 
great that, instead of diplomatic politeness, there is positive 
hectoring, with dictation, threats and ahuse. Even the Italian 
peasant is said occasionally to offer both abuse and physical 
violence to the image of a recalcitrant saint; and antiquity 
wondered at the bullying manner of the Egyptians towards 
their gods (cf. Iamblichus, Be mysteriis, vi, 5-7). This frame 
of mind, however, is mainly symptomatic of the lower levels 



PRAYER 



257 



of cult. Thus the Zulu says to the ancestral ghost, " Help me 
or you will feed on nettles "; whilst the still more primitive 
Australian exclaims to the " dead hand " that he carries about 
with him as a kind of divining-rod, " Guide me aright, or I 
throw you to the dogs." 

So far we have dealt with forms of address explicitly directed 
towards a power that, one might naturally conclude, has 
personality, since it is apparently expected to hear and answer. 
At the primitive stage, however, the degree of personification is, 
probably, often far slighter than the words used would seem 
to suggest. The verbal employment of vocatives and of the 
second person may have little or no personifying force, serving 
primarily but to make the speaker's wish and idea intelligible 
to himself. When the rustic talks in the vernacular to his horse 
he is not much concerned to know whether he is heard and 
understood; still less when he mutters threats against an absent 
rival, or kicks the stool that has tripped him up with a vicious 
"Take that!" 

These considerations may help towards the understanding 
of a second class of cases, namely, forms of implicit address 
shading off into unaddressed formulas. Wishings, blessings, 
cursings, oaths, vows, exorcisms, and so on, are uttered aloud, 
doubtless partly that they may be heard by the human parties 
to the rite, but likewise in many cases that they may be heard, 
or at least overheard, by a consentient deity, perhaps represented 
visibly by an idol or other cult-object. The ease with which 
explicit invocations attach themselves to many of these appar- 
ently self-contained forms proves that there is" not necessarily 
any perceived difference of kind, and that implicit address as 
towards a " something not-ourselves " is often the true designa- 
tion of the latter. On the other hand, there is reason to believe 
that the magical spell proper is a self-contained and self- 
sufficient form of utterance, and that it lies at the root of 
much that has become address, and even prayer in the fullest 
sense.' 

From Spell to Prayer. — Of course to address and entreat a 
fellow-being is a faculty as old as that of speech, and, as soon 
as it occurred to man to treat sacred powers as fellow-beings, 
assuredly there was a beginning of prayer. We do not know, 
and are not likely to know, how religion first arose, and the 
probability is that many springs went to feed that immense 
river. Thus care for the dead may well have been one amongst 
such separate sources. It is natural for sorrow to cry to the 
newly dead " Come backl" and for bereavement to add " Come 
back and help!" Another source is mythologie fancy, which, 
in answer to childlike questions; "Who made the world?" 
"Who made our laws?" and so on, creates "magnified non- 
natural men/' who presently made their appearance in ritual (for 
to think a thing the savage must dance it); whereupon personal 
intercourse becomes possible between such a being and the 
tribesmen, the more so because the supporters of law and order, 
the elders, will wish to associate themselves as closely as possible 
with the supreme law-giver. From Australia, where we have 
the best chance of studying rudimentary religion in some bulk, 
comes a certain amount of evidence showing that in the two 
ways just mentioned some inchoate prayer is being evolved. 
On the other hand, it is remarkable how conspicuous, on the 
whole, is the absence of prayer from the magico-religious ritual 
of the Australians. Uttered formulas abound; yet they are 
not forms of address, but rather the self-sufficient pronounce- 
ments of the magician's^/. Viewed analytically in its developed 
nature, magic is a wonder-working recognized as such, the core 
of the mystery consisting in the supposed transformation of 
suggested idea into accomplished fact by means of that sugges- 
tion itself. To the magician, endowed in the opinion of his 
fellows (and doubtless of himself) with this wonderful power 
of effective suggestion, the output of such power naturally repre- 
sents itself as a kind of unconditional willing. When he cries 
" Rain, rain," or otherwise makes vivid to himself and his 
hearers the idea of rain, expecting that the rain will thereby 
be forced to come, it is as if he had said " Rain, now you must 
come," or simply "Rain, come!" and we find as a fact that 
xxii. 9 



magical formulas mostly assume the tone of an actual or virtual 
imperative, " As I do this, so let the like happen," " I do this in 
order that the like may happen," and so on. Now it is easy to 
" call spirits from the vasty deep," but disappointed experience 
shows that they will not always come. Hence such imperatives 
have a tendency to dwindle into optatives. " Let the demon 
of small-pox depart 1" is replaced by the more humble "Grand- 
father Smallpox, go away!" where the affectionate appellative 
(employed, however, in all likelihood merely to cajole) signalizes 
an approach to the genuine spirit of prayer. Again, the magician 
conscious of his limitations will seek to supplement his influence 
— his mana, as it is termed in the Pacific — by tapping, so to 
speak, whatever sources of similar power lie round about him; 
and these the " magomorphism " of primitive society perceives 
on every hand. A notable method of borrowing power from 
another magic-wielding agency is simply to breathe its name 
in connexion with the spell that stands in need of reinforcement; 
as the name suggests its owner, so it comes to stand for his real 
presence. It is noticeable that even the more highly developed 
forms of liturgical prayer tend, in the recitation of divine titles, 
attributes and the like, to present a survival of this magical 
use of potent names. 

Prayer as a Part of Ritual. — An exactly converse process 
must now be glanced at, whereby, instead of growing out of it, 
prayer actually generates spell. In advanced religion, indeed, 
prayer is the chosen vehicle of the free spirit of worship. Its 
mechanism is not unduly rigid, and it is largely autonomous, 
being rid of subservience to other ritual factors. In more 
primitive ritual, however, set forms of prayer are the rule, and 
their function is mainly to accompany and support a ceremony 
the nerve of which consists in action rather than speech. Hence, 
suppose genuine prayer to have come into being, it is exceedingly 
apt to degenerate into a mere piece of formalism; and yet, 
whereas its intrinsic meaning is dulled by repetition according 
to a well-known pyschological law, its virtue is thereby hardly 
lessened for the undeveloped religious consciousness, which holds 
the saving grace to lie mainly in the repetition itself. But a 
formula that depends for its efficacy on being uttered rather than 
on being heard is virtually indistinguishable from the self- 
sufficient spell of the magician, though its origin is different. A 
good example of a degenerated prayer-ritual comes from the 
Todas (see W. H. R. Rivers, The Todas, ch. x.). The prayer itself 
tends to be slurred over, or even omitted. On the other hand, 
great stress is laid on a preliminary citation of names of power 
followed by the word idith. This at one time seems to have 
meant " for the sake of," carrying with it some idea of suppb'ca- 
tion; but it has now lost this connotation, seeing that it can be 
used not merely after the name of a god, but after that of any 
sacred object or incident held capable of imparting magic 
efficacy to the formula. Even the higher religions have to fight 
against the tendency to " vain repetitions " (often embodying a 
certain sacred number, e.g. three), as well as to the use of prayers 
as amulets, medicinal charms, and so on. Thus, Buddhism 
offers the striking case of the praying- wheel. It remains to 
add that throughout we must carefully distinguish in theory, 
however hard this may be to do in practice, between legitimate 
ritual understood as such, whether integral to prayer, such as 
its verbal forms, or accessory, such as gestures, postures, incense, 
oil or what not, and the formalism of religious decay, such as 
generally betrays itself by its meaninglessness, by its gibberish 
phrases, sing-song intonation and so forth. 

Silent Prayer. — A small point in the history of prayer, but 
one that has an interesting bearing on the subject of its relation 
to magic, is concerned with the custom of praying silently. 
Charms and words of power being supposed to possess efficacy 
in themselves are guarded with great secrecy by their owners, 
and hence, in so far as prayer verges on spell, there will be a 
disposition to mutter or otherwise conceal the sacred formula. 
Thus the prayers of the Todas already alluded to are in all cases 
uttered " in the throat," although these are public prayers, each 
village having a form of its own. At a later stage, when the 
distinction between magic and religion is more clearly recognized

PRAYER, BOOK OF COMMON 



and an anti-social character assigned to the former on the 
ground that it subserves the sinister interests of individuals, 
the overt and as it were congregational nature of the praying 
comes to be insisted on as a guarantee that no magic is being 
employed (cf. Apuleius, ApoL 54, " tacitas preces in templo dis 
allegasti: igitur magus es "), a notion that suffers easy transla- 
tion into the view that there are more or less disreputable gods 
with whom private trafficking may be done on the sly (cf. Horace, 
Ep. I. xvi. 60, " labra movet metuens audiri, Pulchra Laverna, 
da mihi fallere ")■ Thus it is quite in accordance with the out- 
look of the classical period that Plato in his Laws (900-910) 
should prohibit all possession of private shrines or performance 
of private rites; " let a man go to a temple to pray, and let any 
one who pleases join with him in the prayer." Nevertheless, 
instances are not wanting amongst the Greeks of private prayers 
of the loftiest and most disinterested tone (cf. L. R. Farnell, 
The Evolution of Religion, p. 202 seq.). Finally we may note in 
this connexion that in advanced religion, at the point at which 
prayer is coming to be conceived as communion, silent adoration 
is sometimes thought to bring man nearest to God. 

The Moralizalion of Prayer. — When we come to consider the 
moral quality of the act of prayer, this contrast between the 
spirit of public and private religion is fundamental for all but 
the most advanced forms of cult. In its public rites the com- 
munity becomes conscious of common ends and a common 
edification. We may observe how even a very primitive people 
such as the Arunta of Australia behaves with the greatest 
solemnity at its ceremonies, and professes to be made " glad " 
and " strong " thereby; whilst of his countrymen, whom he 
would not trust to pray in private, Plato testifies that in the 
temples during the sacrificial prayers " they show an intense 
earnestness and with eager interest talk to the Gods and beseech 
them " (Laws, 887). We may therefore assume that, in acts 
of public worship at any rate, prayer and its magico-religious 
congeners are at all stages resorted to as a " means of grace," 
even though such grace do not constitute the expressed object of 
petition. Poverty of expression is apt to cloak the real spirit 
of primitive prayer, and the formula under which its aspirations 
may be summed up, namely, " Blessings come, evils go," covers 
all sorts of confused notions about a grace to be acquired and 
an impurity to be wiped away, which, as far back as our clues 
take us, invite interpretations of a decidedly spiritualistic and 
ethical order. To explicate, however, and purge the meaning 
of that " strong heart " and " clean " which the savage after 
his fashion can wish and ask for, remained the task of the higher 
and more self-conscious types of religion. A favourite contrast 
for which there is more to be said is that drawn between the 
magico-religious spell-ritual, that says in effect, " My will be 
done," and the spirit of " Thy will be done " that breathes through 
the highest forms of worship. Such resignation in the face of the 
divine will and providence is, however, not altogether beyond 
the horizon of primitive faith, as witness the following prayer 
of the Khonds of Orissa: " We are ignorant of what it is good 
to ask for. You know what is good for us. Give it to us." 
(Tylor, Prim. Culture, 4. 369.) At this point prayer by a supreme 
paradox virtually extinguishes itself, since in becoming an end 
in itself, a means of contemplative devotion and of mystic 
communing with God, it ceases to have logical need for the 
petitionary form. Thus on the face of it there is something 
like a return to the self-sufficient utterance of antique religion; 
but, in reality, there is all the difference in the world between 
a suggestion directed outwardly in the fruitless attempt to 
conjure nature without first obeying her, and one directed 
towards the inner man so as to establish the peace of God within 
the heart.

PRAYER, BOOK OF COMMON, the title of the official service 
book of the Church of England. One of the most important 
steps taken at the Reformation was the compilation and provi- 
sion of a comprehensive service book for general and compulsory 
use in public worship in all cathedral and parish churches 
throughout the Church of England. 

Apart from alterations in detail, both as to doctrine and ritual, 
which will be referred to later, the following main advantages 
were achieved from the very first and apply to all editions of 
the Prayer Book equally. 

1. The substitution of the English language for the Latin 
language, which had hitherto been in universal and almost 
complete use, and in which all the old service books were written. 

2. Unification and simplification. The number of books 
required for the performance of divine service in pre-Reformation 
days was very large; the most important being the Missal for 
the service of Holy Communion or the Mass; the Breviary for 
the daily service or performance of the divine office; the Manual 
for the minor sacramental offices usually performed by the parish 
priest; and the Pontifical, containing such services as were 
exclusively reserved for performance by the bishop. Many 
of the contents of these larger volumes were published in separate 
volumes known by a great variety — over one hundred — different 
names. The Prayer Book represents in a much condensed and 
abbreviated form the four chief ancient service books, viz.: 
the Missal, Breviary, Manual and Pontifical. 

In addition to a multiplicity of books there was much variety 
of use. Although the Sarum Use prevailed far the most widely, 
yet there were separate Uses of York and Hereford, and also 
to a less degree of Lincoln, Bangor, Exeter, Wells, St Paul's, and 
probably of other dioceses and cathedral churches as well. 
Cranmer's preface " Concerning the Service of the Church " 
expressly mentions the abolition of this variety as one of the 
things to be achieved by a Book of Common Prayer. It says: 
" And whereas heretofore there hath been great diversity in 
saying and singing in Churches within this Realm; some following 
Salisbury Use, some Hereford Use, and some the Use of Bangor, 
some of York, some of Lincoln; now from henceforth all the 
whole Realm shall have but one Use." 

We will next enumerate the sources from which the Prayer Book 
was compiled. 1. It has been already indicated that the older 
pre-Reformation service books formed the main quarry, especially 
those according to the Use of Sarum. Morning and Evening Prayer, 
including the psalter and the lessons, were taken from the Breviary, 
Matins being compiled out of Nocturns (or Matins), Lauds and 
Prime; and Evensong out of Vespers and Compline. The Order 
of Holy Communion, including the collects, epistles and gospels, 
was taken from the Missal. The sacramental and other offices 
which occupy a position in the Prayer Book between the Order 
of Holy Communion and the Psalms were taken from the Manual; 
and the services for consecration or ordering of bishops, priests and 
deacons were taken from the Pontifical; but in all cases not only 
with a change of Latin into English, but with numerous alterations* 
omissions and additions. 

2. The reformed Latin Breviary of Cardinal Quignon, Francis 
de Quinones, a Spaniard, a Franciscan and cardinal of the Holy 
Cross, brought out a reformed Latin breviary with papal sanction 
i°. I 535- .A second and revised edition appeared in~~1537. It met 
with considerable favour, and was adopted into use in many places, 
without, however, winning universal acceptance, and in 1558 papal 



PRAYER, BOOK OF COMMON

sanction was withdrawn and it ceased to be printed. From this 
reformed breviary the compilers of the Prayer Hook borrowed the 
following, (a) Many passages — almost verbatim — in the preface 
" Concerning the Service of the Church." It would occupy too 
much space to print them in parallel columns here. (6) Making 
the Sunday and Holy-day services identical in structure with the 
week-day services, (c) The removal of all antiphons and responds. 
This refers to Quignon's first edition only, (d) The increased 
amount of Holy Scripture read. Quignon provided a first lesson 
from the Old Testament ; a second lesson from the New Testament ; 
and on Saints' Days a third lesson from the Lives of the Saints, 
though this lesson was also occasionally taken from Holy Scripture. 
(e) The prefixing to every service a form of confession and absolu- 
tion. The idea, not the actual language, is borrowed by the Prayer 
Book. (/) The substitution of the Athanasian Creed for the Apostles' 
Creed on certain days instead of the former being an addition to 
the latter. So in the Prayer Book, when used, the Athanasian 
Creed is substituted for, not added to, the shorter creed, (g) The 
uniform assignment of three Psalms to each hour suggests the 
average number and arrangement of the Psalms in the Prayer Book 
at Matins and Evensong. 

3. The Mozarabic Missal, (a) The four short prayers preceding 
the prayer for the consecration of the water in the office for the public 
baptism of infants are adapted from the benediction of the font 
in the Mozarabic Liturgy (Migne, Pat. Lat. torn, lxxxv. col. 465). 
The evidence for this borrowing is still plainer in the larger form of 
prayer for this purpose provided in the first book of Edward VI. 
The Mozarabic Liturgry was printed and published under Cardinal 
Ximenes in 1500, and may well have^ been in Cranmer's hands; 
whereas the Missale gallicanum, a Gallican Sacramentary, contain- 
ing the same prayers with slight variations, was first published by 
Cardinal Thomesius in 1680 and must have been unknown to 
Cranmer. (6) According to F. Procter and W. H. Frere (A New 
History of the Book of Common Prayer, p. 37*: London, 1902), the 
use of the plural number instead of the singular in the form of the 
opening versicles of Morning and Evening prayer is a following of 
Mozarabic usage. But we have been unable to verify this statement, 
(c) Many of the new collects introduced into the Prayer Book, 
though not transferred bodily from any Mozarabic service book, 
are modelled upon a Mozarabic pattern, and preserve some Mozarabic 
ideas and phrases, e.g. the references to the Second Adventin the 
collects for the first and third Sundays in Advent take their tone 
from the Mozarabic Advent services. The collect for Christmas 
Day is based on a collect for Christmas Day Lauds in the Mozarabic 
Breviary (Migne, Pat. Lat. torn, lxxxvi., col. 122). The collect 
for the first Sunday in Lent is based on a preface (Inlatio) in the 
Mass fo^thc Wednesday after the fifth Sunday in Lent (ibid., torn. 
Ixxxv., col. 382). The collect for the first Sunday after Easter 
is based upon an " Alia Oratio " (ibid., col. 517), and an " Oratio ad 
pacem " (col. 518) for the Saturday in Easter week. The collect 
for St Andrew's Day is based on a Missa in the Mozarabic Mass for 
the same festival (ibid., col. 159). Other examples might be given, 
but this is hardly the«place for complete details, (a) The many 
addresses, beginning with " Dearly beloved brethren " ("the Scripture 
moveth us/' &c), introduced into most of the services in the Prayer 
Book, correspond to the addresses which, under the title of " Missa," 
and generally addressed to " fratres dilectissimi " or " carissimi," 
form part of every Mozarabic Mass. (e) The prayer of consecration 
in the Order of Holy Communion, especially as # regards the recital 
of the words of institution commencing " Who in the same night," 
&c., follows a Mozarabic rather than the Sarum or Roman model 
in several respects, but the same features are found in the consecra- 
tion prayer in the Brandenburg-Ntirnberg agenda of 1533, and it is 
doubtful whether the Anglican borrowing is from a Mozarabic or a 
Lutheran source. Possibly both the Anglican and Lutheran formulae 
are derived independently from the Mozarabic ; because, as we have 

'seen, a Mozarabic missal was certainly in Cranmer's hands and 
studied by him. 

4. Eastern Liturgies. These were certainly known to Cranmer, 
but it is remarkable how little he borrowed from them, (a) The 
prayer which was placed at the end of the Litany in 1549, and now 
stands as the last prayer but one at the end of Matins and Evensong, 
as well as of the Litany, was undoubtedly borrowed from the Liturgy 
of St Chrysostom, where, as likewise in the Liturgy of St Basil, it 
forms the prayer of the third antiphon after the Deacon's Litany 
in the Mass of the Catechumens. (6) The concluding prayer of 
Matins and Evensong, " The Grace of our Lord," &c, which was 
added in 1662, may have been taken from Greek liturgies. It is 
the opening salutation in the Mass of the Catechumens in the 
Clementine Liturgy, where it occurs again, as it does in the 
Greek Liturgies before the " Sursum corda"; though there 
is no evidence to prove that it was not taken directly from Holy 
Scripture (2 Cor. xiii. \±). {c) The Epiklesis or invocation of the 
Holy Spirit upon the elements, must have been copied from an 
Eastern Liturgy. It occurs in the 1549 Prayer Book, but has been 
omitted in all subsequent editions. It runs thus: "Hear us, O 
merciful Father, we beseech Thee, and with Thy holy Spirit and word 
vouchsafe to bit ess and sancftify these Thy gifts and creatures 
of hread and wine, that they may be unto us the body and blood 
of Thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ." 



This is not an exact translation of any known epiklesis, and Cranmer 
altered hs position from after to immediately before the words of 
institution, (d) Four petitions in the Litany. " That it may please 
Thee to illuminate all Bishops, Priests and Deacons," &c. (altered 
in 1 661 from all Bishops, pastors and ministers) and " That it may 
please Thee to give to all nations unity, peace and concord," and 
44 That it may please Thee to succour, help and comfort all that 
are in danger, necessity and tribulation," and " That it may please 
Thee to preserve all that travel by land or by water, all women 
labouring of child, all sick persons, and young children, and to 
show Thy pity upon all prisoners and captives 1" are almost 
certainly modelled on corresponding petitions in the Deacon's 
Litany in the Liturgy of St Chrysostom (ed. F. E. Brightman, 
P< 362, i. 35, and p. 363, lines 4, 17, 15). At least, they resemble 
far more closely the Greek petitions than they do any correspond- 
ing Latin petitions in the Old Sarum Litany. 

5. Lutheran and other continental Protestant service books. 
The most considerable quantity of the new material which was 
imported into the Prayer Book was drawn from Lutheran and 
Genevan service books. The Litany, for example, in the Prayer 
Book is based upon the medieval Latin Litany, but great variation 
both in substance and language and by way of addition and omission, 
are made in it. These variations are largely borrowed from and 
closely follow the language of various Lutheran litanies, especially 
that given in the consultation of Archbishop Hermann of Cologne 
issued in 1543. Lutheran influence can likewise be traced in way 
of variation introduced into the baptismal and other sacramental 
or occasional offices. So in the Communion service the most 
striking departures from ancient precedent have a Protestant 
origin. The introduction of the Ten Commandments in 1553 seems 
to be derived from the order of service published by Valerandus 
Pollanus (Pullain) in 1551 ; and that of the Comfortable Words in 
1549 is borrowed, though all the texts chosen are not identical, from 
the Consultation of Hermann. It is impossible to pursue this subject 
here further in detail. 

6. Original compositions of the compilers of the Prayer Book* 
not traceable to ancient or 16th-century originals. These are not 
numerous. They include most of the collects on Saints' Days, for 
which, though no direct evidence of authorship is as yet forthcoming, 
Cranmer is probably responsible, and certain other collects, such as 
that for the Royal Faftiily (Archbishop Whitgift); that for the high 
court of parliament (Archbishop Laud); that for all conditions 
of men (Bishop Gunning), &c. 

We proceed to describe next the various stages through which 
the Book of Common Prayer has passed and the leading features 
of each revision. Of changes preceding the first Prayer Book 
it will only be necessary to mention here: (a) The compiling and 
publishing of the Litany in English by Cranmer in 1544. (b) 
Royal injunctions in August 1547 ordering the Epistle and Gospel 
to be read in English at High Mass. (c) A royal proclamation, 
dated the 8th of March 1548, imposing for use at the coming - 
Easter The Order of the Communion. This was an order or 
form of service in English for the communion of the people in 
both kinds. It was to be inserted into the service after the 
communion of the priest, without making any other alteration 
in the Latin Mass. It comprised the long exhortation or 
notice to be given on Sunday, or on some other day, previous 
to the Communion, the longer exhortation, and the shorter 
invitation, the confession, absolution, comfortable words, prayer 
of humble access, formulae of administration and the concluding 
peace, all as they exist at present, though with variations of 
some importance. 

The first complete vernacular Book of Common Prayer was 
issued in 1549. It was carried through both houses of parliament 
by the 21st of January 1549, by an Act of Uniformity which 
made its use compulsory on and after the following Whit-Sunday. 
The exact date of the giving of the royal assent, and the 
question whether this Book received the assent of Convocation, 
arc historical points of difficulty and uncertainty which cannot 
be treated at length here. 

Some of the chief points of difference between this and subse- 
quent Prayer Books were the following: Matins and Evensong 
began with the Lord's Prayer, and ended with the third collect; 
there were no alternative Psalm-canticles for Benedict us, 
Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis; the Athanasian Creed was 
introduced after the Benedictus on six festivals only, and in 
addition to the Apostles' Creed; the Litany was placed after 
the Communion service, for which an alternative title was given, 
viz.: "commonly called the Mass." Introits were provided 
for use on every Sunday and Holy-Day; after the offertory 



26o 



PRAYER, BOOK OF COMMON 



intending communicants were directed to " tarry still in the quire 
or in some convenient place nigh the quire "; in the prayer 
" for the whole state of Christ's church," the blessed Virgin 
Mary was commemorated by name among departed saints; 
prayer for the departed was explicitly retained; also an invoca- 
tion .of the Holy Spirit before the words of institution, the 
prayer of oblation immediately following them. The mixed 
chalice was ordered to be used, and the Agnus Dei to be sung 
during the Communion of the people. A large selection of short 
scriptural post-Communions: was provided. Unleavened bread 
was to be used and placed not in the hand but in the mouth of 
the communicant. The sign of the cross was to be made not 
only in the cucharistic consecration prayer, but also in Baptism, 
Confirmation, Holy Matrimony and the Visitation of the Sick. 
Reservation for the sick and unction of the sick were retained; 
and exorcism, unction, trine immersion and the chrisom were 
included in the baptismal service. The prayer in the burial 
service, as in the Communion service, contained distinct inter- 
cessions for the departed; and a form of Holy Communion was 
provided for use at funerals with proper introit, collect, epistle 
and gospel. 

As to vestments, in the choir offices, the surplice only was to 
be used; the hood being added in cathedrals and colleges; and 
by all graduates when preaching, everywhere. 

At Holy Communion the officiating priest was to wear " a 
white Albe plain with a vestment or Cope," and the assistant 
clergy were to wear " Albes with tuniclcs." Whenever a bishop 
was celebrant he was to wear, " beside his rochette, a surplice 
or albe, and a cope or vestment," and also to carry " his pastoral 
staff in his hand, or else borne or holden by his chaplain." The' 
mitre was not mentioned. 

The ordinal was not attached to this Prayer Book at its first 
appearance, but it was added under another act of parliament 
in the following year, 1550. It was very similar to the present 
ordinal except that the words " for the office and work of a 
Priest in the Church of God, now committed unto thee by the 
Imposition of our hands " were wanting, and the chalice or 
cup with the bread were delivered, as well as a Bible, to each 
newly-ordained priest. 

We pass on to 1552 when a new and revised edition of the 
Prayer Book was introduced by an act of parliament which 
ordered that it should come into use on All Saints' Day (Nov. 1). 
The alterations made in it were many and important, and as 
they represent the furthest point ever reached by the Prayer 
Book in a Protestant direction, they deserve special mention 
and attention. 

1. The introductory sentences, exhortation, confession and 
absolution were prefixed to the Order for Morning Prayer daily 
throughout the year and ordered to be read before Evening 
Prayer as well. Alternative Psalms were provided for Benedictus, 
Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis. 

2. Numerous and most important alterations were made in 
the Order for Holy Communion, in the title of which the words 
" commonly called the Mass " were left out. (a) The Introits 
were omitted, (b) Gloria in excelsis was transferred from near 
the beginning to near the end of the service, (c) The ten com- 
mandments with an expanded tenfold Kyrie eleison were intro- 
duced, (d) The long new English canon of 1549 was split up 
into three parts: the first part becoming the prayer for the church 
militant; the second part becoming the prayer of consecration, 
the third part, or prayer of oblation, becoming the first post- 
Communion collect ; the epiklesis or invocation of the Holy Ghost 
upon the elements was entirely omitted, (e) The mixed chalice, 
the use of the sign of the cross in the consecration prayer; the 
commemoration of the blessed Virgin Mary and of various 
classes of saints were omitted. (/) The Agnus Dei and the post- 
Communion anthems were omitted, (g) The words of adminis- 
tration in the 1549 book were abolished, viz.: " The body of 
our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee, preserve thy 
body and soul unto everlasting life," and " The blood of our 
Lord Jesus Christ which was shed for thee preserve thy body 
and soul unto everlasting life," and the following words were 



substituted : " Take and eat this in remembrance that Christ died 
for thee, and feed on him in thy heart by faith, with thanks- 
giving," and " Drink this in remembrance that Christ's blood 
was shed for thee, and be thankful." (//) A long rubric was added 
at the end of the service explanatory of the attitude of kneeling 
at the reception of Holy Communion, in which it was stated 
that " it is not meant hereby that any adoration is done, or 
ought to be done, either unto the sacramental bread and wine 
there bodily received, or to any real and essential presence there 
being of Christ's natural flesh and blood," &c. (i) Exorcism, 
unction, trine immersion and the chrisom were omitted from 
the baptismal service, (k) Unction and communion with the 
reserved sacrament were removed from the services for the 
visitation and the communion of the sick. (/) Prayers for the 
dead and provision for a celebration of Holy Communion at a 
funeral were removed from the hurial service, (m) The vest- 
ments retained and ordered under the Prayer Book of 1549 were 
abolished by a new rubric which directed that both at the time 
of Communion and at all other times of ministration a bishop 
should wear a rochet and that a priest or deacon should have 
and wear a surplice only; (n) on the other hand, the directions 
as to daily service were extended to all clergy and made much 
stricter, (0) and the number of days on which the Athanasian 
Creed was to be used was raised from six to thirteen. 

The main objects of these drastic alterations have been thought 
to have been two-fold. 

1. To abolish all ritual for which there was not scriptural 
warrant. If this was their object it was not consistently or 
completely carried out. No scriptural warrant can be found 
for the use of the surplice, or for the use of the sign of the cross 
in baptism, both of which were retained. 

2. To make the services as unlike the pre-Reformation services 
as possible. This object too was not fully attained; no liturgical 
precedent can be found for the violent dislocation of certain 
parts of the Order for Holy Communion, especially in the case 
of the prayer of oblation and of the Gloria in Excelsis; but the 
orders for Morning and Evening Prayer and the Holy Communion 
retained features of the Breviary and Missal services, -the bulk 
of their component material being still drawn from them. While 
the alterations, therefore, were violent enough to alarm and 
offend the Catholic party, they were not violent enough to satisfy 
the extreme Puritan party, who would no doubt have agitated 
for and would probably have obtained still further reformation 
and revision. But this Prayer Book only lived for eight months. 
It came into use on All Saints' Day (Nov. 1) 1552, and on the 6th 
of July 1553 Edward VI. died and was succeeded by his sister 
Mary, under whom the Prayer Book was abolished and the old 
Latin services and service books resumed their place. 

On the death of Queen Mary and the accession of her sister 
Elizabeth (Nov. 17, 1558) all was reversed, and the Book of 
Common Prayer was restored into use again. 

The Act of Uniformity, which obtained final parliamentary 
authority on the 28th of April 1559, ordered that the Prayer 
Book should come again into use on St John the Baptist's Day 
(June 24, 1559). This was the second Prayer Book of King 
Edward VI., with the following few but important alterations, 
which, like all the alterations introduced at subsequent dates 
into the Prayer Book, were in a Catholic rather than in a 
Protestant direction. 

1. Morning and Evening Prayer were directed to be " used 
in the accustomed place of the church, chapel or chancel, instead 
of " in such place as the people may best hear." 

2. The rubric ordering the use of the rochet only by the 
bishop and of surplice only by a priest or deacon was abolished. 
The eucharistic vestments ordered in the first Prayer Book of 
Edward VI. were brought back by a new rubric which directed 
that " the minister at the time of the communion and at all 
other times in his ministration, shall use such vestments in the 
church as were in use by authority of parliament in the second 
year of the reign of King Edward the VI. according to the act 
of parliament set in the beginning of this book. 

3. In the Litany the following petition found in both the 



PRAYER, BOOK OF COMMON 



261 



Edwardian Prayer Books was omitted " from the tyranny of 
the bishop of Rome and all his detestable enormities, good 
Lord deliver us." 

4. In the Communion service the two clauses of administration 
found in the first and second Prayer Books of King Edward's 
reign were combined. 

5. The rubric explanatory of " kneeling for reception," com- 
monly known as " the Black Rubric " was omitted. 

6. In the Ordinal in the rubric before the oath of the queen's 
sovereignty the words " against the power and authority of all 
foreign potentates " were substituted for " against the usurped 
power and authority of the Bishop of Rome," and in the oath 
itself four references to the bishop of Rome, by name, were 
omitted. 

There were a few more minor alterations, without doctrinal or 
political significance which need not be described in detail here. 

The only further addition or alteration made in Queen 
Elizabeth's reign was in 1561, when all the present black letter 
Holy Days were added to the Kalendar except St George 
(April 23) Lammas (Aug. 1), St Laurence (Aug. 10) and St 
Clement (Nov. 22), which already existed, and except St 
Enurchus (Sept. 7), added in 1604, and the Venerable Bede 
(May 27) and St Alban (June 17) added in 1662. 

A smouldering arid growing Puritan discontent with the Prayer 
Book, suppressed with a firm hand under Queen Elizabeth, burst 
out into a flame on the accession of King James I. in 1603. 
A petition called the millenary petition, because signed by no 
less than one thousand ministers, was soon presented to him, 
asking, among other things, for various alterations in the Prayer 
Book and specifying the alterations desired. As a result the 
king summoned a conference of leading Puritan divines, 
and of bishops and other leading Angb'can divines, which 
met under his presidency at Hampton Court in January 1604. 
After both sides had been heard, certain alterations were 
determined upon and were ordered by royal authority, with the 
general assent of Convocation. These alterations were not very 
numerous nor of great importance, but such as they were they all 
went in the direction of catholicizing rather than of puritanizing 
the Prayer Book; the one exception being the substitution of 
some chapters of the canonical scriptures for some chapters 
of the Apocrypha, especially of the book of Tobit. Other 
changes were: — 

1. The addition of one more black letter Saint's Day, viz.: 
Enurchus (by error for Evurtius) on the 7th of September. This 
was a small but a very extraordinary and an inexplicable change 
to make. The only explanation offered, which is a pure guess 
and seems barely possible, is that it was desired to place some 
mark of dignity upon a day which during the late reign had 
been kept with great festivity as the birthday of Queen Elizabeth. 

2. The words, " The absolution to be pronounced by the 
minister alone " at Morning and Evening Prayer, were altered 
to " The Absolution, or Remission of Sins, to be pronounced 
by the priest alone, standing; the people still kneeling." 

3. A prayer for the royal family was added after the prayer 
for the king, and a petition was added in the Litany to the same 
effect, both exhibiting slight verbal differences from the prayer 
and petition as used to-day. 

4.. Thanksgiving prayers were added for rain, for fair weather, 
for plenty, for peace and victory. 

5. Important alterations were introduced into the service 
for the private baptism of children in houses, with the object 
of doing away with lay baptism and securing the administration 
by the minister of the parish, or some other lawful minister. 

6. The confirmation service was entitled and explained thus: 
" The Order of Confirmation, or Laying on of Hands upon 
Children Baptized, and able to render an account of their faith 
according to the Catechism following." 

7. The concluding portion of the Catechism, consisting of 
eleven questions on the sacraments, was now added. 

There were other slight changes of a verbal kind, involving 
no doctrinal or political significance and which therefore need 
not be described here. 



The next important stage in the history of the Prayer Book 
was its total suppression in 1645 for a period of fifteen years. 
" the Directory for the Public Worship of God in the Three 
Kingdoms " being established in its place. The restoration 
of King Charles II. in 1660 brought with it toleration at once, 
and soon afterwards complete restoration of the Prayer Book, 
but not exactly in the same form which it had before. Non- 
conformists pressed upon the king, either that the Prayer Book 
should not be re-introduced, or that if it were re-introduced, 
features which they objected to might be removed. The result 
was that a conference was held in 1661, known from its place 
of meeting as the Savoy Conference, the church being represented 
by twelve bishops and the Nonconformists by twelve eminent 
Presbyterian divines, each side accompanied by nine coadjutors. 

The objections raised from the Nonconformist point of view 
were numerous and varied, but they, were thoroughly discussed 
between the first meeting on the 15th of April and the last on 
the 24th of July 1661; the bishops agreeing to meet the Puritan 
wishes on a few minor points but on none of fundamental 
importance. Later in the year, between the 20th of November 
and the 20th of December, Convocation assembled and under- 
took the revision of the Prayer Book. In the earlier part of 
the following year the book so revised came before parliament. 
No amendment was made in it in either house and it finally 
received the royal assent on the 19th of May 1662, being annexed 
to an Act of Uniformity which provided for its coming into 
general and compulsory use on St Bartholomew's Day (Aug. 24). 

The alterations thus introduced were very numerous, amount- 
ing to many hundreds, and many of them were more important 
than any which had been introduced into the Prayer Book since 
1552. Their general tendency was distinctly in a Catholic as 
opposed to a Puritan direction, and the two thousand Puritan 
incumbents who vacated their benefices on St Bartholomew's 
Day rather than accept the altered Prayer Book bear eloquent 
testimony to that fact. 

It is impossible to give here an exhaustive list of the alterations: 
but the following were some of the principal changes made in 1662. 
(a) The preface " It hath been the wisdom of the Church of England," 
&c, composed by Sanderson, bishop of Lincoln, was prefixed to 
the Prayer Book, (b) The authorized version of the Bible of 161 1 
was taken into use, except in the case of the Psalms, where the 
great Bible of 1 539-1540 was retained as much smoother for singing, 
and in parts of the Communion service, (c) The rubric preceding 
the absolution in Morning andEvening Prayer, viz.: ** The absolu- 
tion to be pronounced by the minister alone, was altered into " The 
Absolution, or Remission of Sins, to be pronounced by the priest 
alone, standing; the people still kneeling. (d) In the Litany the 
phrase "Bishops, Pastors and Ministers of the Church," was altered 
into " Bishops, Priests and Deacons," and in the clause commencing 
41 From all sedition and privy conspiracy," &c, the words " rebellion 
and " schism " were added. («) Among the " Prayers and Thanks- 
givings upon several occasions," were added the two Ember week 
prayers, the prayer for the high court of parliament, the collect or 
prayer for all conditions of men, the general thanksgiving, and that 
4 For restoring Public Peace at Home." (/) In the Communion 
service two rubrics were prefixed to the prayer " for the whole state 
of Christ's Church militant here in earth " ordering the humble 
presentation and placing of the alms upon the Holy Table, and the 
placing thereon then of so much Bread and Wine as the priest shall 
think sufficient; and (g) the commemoration of the departed was 
added to the prayer itself, (h) The rubric explanatory of the posture 
of kneeling for reception, known as 'the Black Rubric, which had 
been added in 1562, but omitted in 1559 and 1604, was re-introduced; 
but the words " to any real and essential presence there being of 
Christ's natural flesh and blood " were altered to " unto any Corporal 
Presence of Christ's natural Flesh and Blood " — a very important 
and significant alteration which affected the meaning of the whole 
rubric, (t) Rubrics were also added ordering the manual acts by 
the priest in the prayer of consecration, and the covering of the 
remainder of the consecrated elements after Communion with a fair 
linen cloth, (k) A new office was added for the Ministration of 
Baptism to such as are of riper years. (Q A rubric was prefixed 
to the Order for the Burial of the Dead, forbidding that order tp 
be used 4I for any that die unbaptized, or excommunicate, or have 
laid violent hands upon themselves." (m) In the " Ordering of 
Priests,]' and 44 the Consecration of Bishops," in the formula for 
ordination, after the "words, " Receive the Holy Ghost," these words 
were added " for the Office and Work of a Pnest (or Bishop) in the 
Church of God, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of our 
hands." (n) The ornaments rubric, regulating the vesture of the

PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD 






clergy was thrown into its present shape, referring back not to 1604 
or 1559 or 1552, but to the first Prayer Book of Edward VI. in 1549 
for the rule to be followed. 

The above are the important alterations, among numerous 
others of minor significance, introduced into the Prayer Book 
in 1662. Their general trend is obvious. It is not in the Puritan 
direction, but intended to emphasize and to make more clear 
church doctrine and discipline, which in recent years had become 
obscured or decayed. No substantial alteration has been made 
in the Prayer Book since 1662, but two alterations must be 
chronicled as having obtained the sanction of the Convocations 
of Canterbury and York, and also legal force by act of parliament. 
In 1871 a new Lectionary was substituted for the previously 
existing one, into the merits and demerits of which it is not 
possible to enter here; and in 1872, by the Act of Uniformity 
Amendment Act, a shortened form of service was provided 
instead of the present form of Morning and Evening Prayer for 
optional use in other than cathedral churches on all days exeept 
Sunday, Christmas Day, Ash Wednesday, Good Friday and 
Ascension Day; provision was also statutably made for the 
separation of services, and for additional services, to be taken, 
however, except so far as anthems and hymns are concerned, 
entirely out of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. 

In the year 1907 letters of business were issued by the Crown 
to the Convocations inviting and enabling them to make altera- 
tions in the Prayer Book (afterwards to be embodied in an act 
of parliament). These letters were issued in compliance with 
the second recommendation (1906) of the Royal Commission 
on Ecclesiastical Discipline, viz.: that " Letters of business 
should be issued to the Convocations with instructions: (a) to 
consider the preparation of a new rubric regulating the orna- 
ments (that is to say, the vesture) of the ministers of the church, 
at the times of their ministrations, with a view to its enact- 
ment by parliament; and (b) to frame, with a view to their 
enactment of parliament, such modifications in the existing law 
relating to the conduct of Divine Service, and to the orna- 
ments and fittings of churches as may tend to secure the greater 
elasticity which a reasonable recognition of the comprehensive- 
ness of the Church of England and of its present needs seems to 
demand." 

A_ few words are added in conclusion about the state services. 
Until the year 1859 they were four in number. 

1. A Form of Prayer with Thanksgiving to be used yearly upon 
the Fifth Day of November, to commemorate the happy deliverance 
of King James I. and the Three Estates of England trom the Gun- 
powder Plot in 1604. 

2. A Form of Prayer with Fasting to be used yearly on the 
Thirtieth Day of January, to commemorate the Martyrdom of the 
Blessed King Charles the First in 1649. 

3. A Form of Prayer with Thanksgiving to be used yearly on the 
Twenty-ninth Day of May, to commemorate the Restoration to the 
throne of King Charles the Second in 1660. 

4. A Form of Prayer with Thanksgiving to be used yearly on the 
Day of the Accession of the reigning Monarch. 

The first three of these services were abolished in 1859 by royal 
warrant— that is to say by the exercise of the same authority which 
had instituted them. The fourth form of service was retained in 
its old shape till 1901, when a new form, or rather new forms of 
service, having been prepared by Convocation, were authorized by 
royal warrant on the 9th of November. (F. E. W.) 

PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD. Wherever there is a belief in 
the continued existence of man's personality through and after 
death, religion naturally concerns itself with the relations between 
the living and the dead. And where the idea of a future judg- 
ment obtains, prayers are often offered on their behalf to the 
Higher Powers. Prayers for the dead are mentioned in 2 Mac- 
cabees xii. 43-45, where the writer is uncertain whether to 
regard the sacrifice offered by Judas as a propitiatory sin-offering 
or as a memorial thank-offering, a distinction of great importance 
in the later history of the practice. Prayers for the dead form 
part of the authorized Jewish services. The form in use in 
England contains the following passage: " Have mercy upon 
him; pardon all his transgressions . . . Shelter his soul in the 
shadow of Thy wings. Make known to him the path of life." 
The only passage in the New Testament which is held to bear 



directly on the subject is 2 Tim. i. 18, where, however, it is not 
certain that Onesiphorus, for whom St Paul prayed, was dead. 
Outside the Bible the proof of the early use of prayers for the 
dead has been carried a step farther by Professor Ramsay's 
discoveries, for it is now impossible to doubt the genuineness 
of the copy (contained in the spurious acts of the saint) of the 
inscription on the tomb of Abercius of Hieropolis in Phrygia 
(see Lightfoot, Apostolic Fathers, pt. ii. vol. i. p. 492 sqq.). The 
19th line of the inscription runs thus: " Let every friend who 
observeth this pray for me," i.e. Abercius, who throughout 
speaks in the first person: he died in the latter part of the 2nd 
century. The inscriptions in the Roman catacombs bear similar 
witness to the practice, by the occurrence of such phrases as 
" Mayst thou live among the saints " (3rd century); " May God 
refresh the soul of . . . "; " Peace be with them." Among 
Church writers Tertullian is the first to mention prayers for 
the dead, and that not as a concession to natural sentiment, 
but as a duty: " The widow who does not pray for her dead 
husband has as good as divorced him." This passage occurs 
in one of his later Montanistic writings, dating from the beginning 
of the 3rd century. Subsequent writers similarly make incidental 
mention of the practice as prevalent, but not as unlawful or even 
disputed (until Aerius challenged it towards the end of the 
4th century). The most famous instance is St Augustine's 
prayer for his mother, Monica, at the end of the 9th book of 
his Confessions. 

An important element in the liturgies of the various Churches 
consisted of the diptychs or lists of names of living and dead 
who were to be commemorated at the Eucharist. To be inserted 
in these lists was an honour, and out of the practice grew the 
canonization of saints; on the other hand, to be excluded was a 
condemnation. In the middle of the 3rd century we find Cyprian 
enjoining that there should be no oblation or public prayer made 
for a deceased layman who had broken a Church rule by appoint- 
ing a cleric trustee under his will: " He ought not to be named 
in the priests' prayer who has done his best to detain the clergy 
from the altar." Although it is not possible, as a rule, to name 
dates for the exact words used in the ancient liturgies, yet the 
universal occurrence of these diptychs and of definite prayers 
for the dead in all parts of the Church in the 4th and 5th centuries 
tends to show how primitive such prayers were. The language 
used in the prayers for the departed is very reserved, and contains 
no suggestion of a place or state of pain. We may cite the 
following from the so-called liturgy of St James: — 

" Remember, O Lord, the God of Spirits and of all Flesh, those 
whom we have remembered and those whom we have not remem- 
bered, men of the true faith, frorn^ righteous Abel unto to-day; do 
thou thyself give them rest there in the land of the living, in thy 
kingdom, in the delight of Paradise, in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac 
and Jacob, our holy fathers, from whence pain and sorrow and 
sighing have fled away, where the light of thy countenance visiteth 
them and always shineth upon them." 

Public prayers were only offered for those who were believed 
to have died as faithful members of Christ. But Perpetua, who 
was martyred in 202, believed herself to have been encouraged 
by a vision to pray for her brother, who had died in his eighth 
year, almost certainly unbaptized; and a later vision assured 
her that her prayer had been answered and he translated from 
punishment. St Augustine thought it needful to point out that 
the narrative was not canonical Scripture, and contended that 
the child had perhaps been baptized. Similarly, a medieval 
legend relates that Gregory the Great was so struck with the 
justice of the emperor Trajan, that he prayed for him, and in 
consequence he was admitted to Paradise (cf. Dante, Purg. x., 
Par ad. xx.). 

As time went on, further developments took place. Petitions 
to God that he would hear the intercessions of the departed 
became direct requests to them to pray (Ora pro nobis); and, 
finally, the saints were asked themselves to grant grace and help. 
Again, men felt difficulty in supposing that one who repented 
at the close of a wicked life could at once enjoy the fellowship 
of the saints in Paradise (St Luke xxiii. 43), and it seemed unfair 
that they should be made equal with those who had borne the

263 



burden and heat of the day (St Matt. xx. 1 2). And so the simple 
severance between good and bad indicated in St Luke vi. 26, 
became the threefold division made familiar by Dante. These 
speculations were further fixed by the growth of the theory 
of satisfaction and of Indulgences: each forgiven soul was 
supposed to have to endure an amount of suffering in proportion 
to the guilt of its sins, and the prayers and pious acts of the living 
availed to shorten this penance time in Purgatory (see Indul- 
gences). It thus came about that prayers for the dead were 
regarded only as aiming at the deliverance of souls from pur- 
gatorial fires; and that application of the Eucharist seems to 
have overshadowed all others. The Council of Trent attempted 
certain reforms in the matter, with more or less success; but, 
broadly speaking, the system still remains in the Roman Catholic 
Church, and masses for the dead are a very important part of 
its acts of worship. 

The Reformation took its rise in a righteous protest against 
the sale of Indulgences; and by a natural reaction the Protestants, 
in rejecting the Roman doctrine of Purgatory, were inclined to 
disuse all prayers for the dead. Important changes have been 
made, in the successive revisions of the Prayer Book, in the 
commemorations of the dead at the Eucharist and in the Burial 
Service. 

In the Communion Service of 1549, after praise and thanks 
were offered for all the saints, chiefly the Blessed Virgin, came 
the following: " We commend into thy mercy all other thy 
servants, which are departed hence from us wuth the sign of 
faith and now do rest in the sleep of peace: grant unto them, 
we beseech thee, thy mercy and everlasting peace." The 
Burial Service of the same date contained explicit prayers for 
the deceased, and introit, collect, epistle and gospel were 
provided for " the Celebration of the Holy Communion when 
there is a Burial of the Dead." In 1552, under the influence 
of Bucer, all mention of the dead, whether commemorative or 
intercessory, was cut out of the Eucharist; the prayers in the 
Burial Service were brought into their present form; and the 
provision for Holy Communion at a Burial was omitted. The 
thankful commemoration of the dead in the Eucharist was 
restored in 1661, but prayers for them remained, if they remained 
at all, veiled in ambiguous phrases. 

The Church of England has never forbidden prayers for the 
dead, however little she has used them in her public services. 
It was proposed in 1552 to condemn the scholastic doctrine De 
precatione pro defunctis in what is now the 22nd of the Thirty- 
Nine Articles, but the proposal was rejected. And these inter- 
cessions have been used in private by a long list of English 
divines, among whom Andrewes, Cosin, Ken, Wesley and Keble 
form an almost complete chain down to the present day. On 
the tomb of Bishop Barrow (1680) stands a request to passers-by 
to pray for their fellow-servant. And in a suit (1838) as to the 
lawfulness of an inscription, " Pray for the soul of . . .," the 
Court decided that " no authority or canon has been pointed 
out by which the practice of praying for the dead has been 
expressly prohibited." As Jeremy Taylor put it {Dissuasive 
from Popery, I. 1. iv.), " General prayers for the dead the Church 
of England never did condemn by any express articles, but left 
it in the middle." 

H. M. Luckock, After Death (1st ed., London, 1879) ;E*.H.Pfumptre, 
The Spirits in Prison (London, 1884). (W. O. B.) 

PRAYING WHEEL, a mechanical apparatus used by the 
Lamaist Buddhists in Tibet and elsewhere for offering prayers. 
Strips of paper bearing a manifold repetition of the words 
" The Jewel in the Lotus, Amen," are wrapped round cylinders 
of all sizes — from hand-mills to wind- or water-mills. As the 
wheel revolves these uncoil and the prayer is considered to be 
offered. 

PREACHING (Fr. prtcher, from Lat. pracdicare, to proclaim), 
the proclamation of a Divine message both to those who have 
not heard it, and to those who, having heard it, have not accepted 
it, and the regular instruction of the converted in the doctrines 
and duties of the faith, is a distinctive though not a peculiar 
feature of the Christian religion. The Mahommedans exercise 



it freely, and it is not unknown among the Buddhists. The 
history of Christian preaching with which alone this article is 
concerned has its roots (1) in the activity of the Hebrew prophets 
and scribes, the former representing the broader appeal, the 
latter the edification of the faithful, (2) in the ministry of Jesus 
Christ and His apostles, where again we have both the evan- 
gelical invitation and the teaching of truth and duty. Which- 
ever element is emphasized in preaching, the preacher is one who 
believes himself to be the ambassador of God, charged with a 
message which it is his duty to deliver. 

r. The Patristic Age, to the Death of St Augustine, a.d. 430. — 
Of the first two centuries we have" very little information. 
From the Acts of the Apostles we gather something as to the 
methods adopted by St Peter and St Paul, and these we may 
believe were more or less general. The Apostles who had known 
the Lord would naturally recall the facts of His life, and the 
story of His words and works would form a great deal of their 
preaching. After they had passed away and before the Christian 
Scriptures were canonically sifted and collected there was a gap 
w r hich for us is only slenderly filled by such productions as the 
so-called 2nd Epistle of Clement, really a rambling homily on 
repentance and confession (see Clementine Literature), and 
by what we can imagine was the practice of men like Ignatius 
and, on the other hand, the Apologists. Most of these were 
primarily writers, but Justin Martyr has left a reputation for 
speaking, especially in debate, as well. Some of the writings 
of Tertullian (c. 200), e.g. those on Patience and Penitence, read 
as though they had been spoken, and it is hard to believe that 
this brilliant rhetorician did not consecrate his powers of address 
to his new faith. Cyprian (d. 258), too, was a finished speaker; 
his Epistle to Donatus emphasizes the need of a simple and un- 
derrated style in the proclamation of the gospel. None of his 
sermons, however, unless we regard his book on the Lord's Prayer 
as a homily, has come down to us. 

By this time the canon of New Testament Scripture was fairly 
settled, and with Origen (d. 254) we find the beginning of preach- 
ing as an explanation and application of definite texts. Origen 
was pre-eminently a teacher, and the didactic side of preaching 
is thus more conspicuous in his work. When we allow for his 
excessive use of the allegorical method, there is still left a great 
deal of power and suggestiveness. In his hands, as may be 
seen from the 19 homilies on Jeremiah that have been preserved 
in the Greek (and others in the Latin of Rufinus), the crude 
homily of his predecessors began to take a more dignified, 
orderly and impressive form. Alongside Origen we may rank 
Hippolytus of Rome on the strength of the one sermon of his 
which is extant, a panegyric on baptism based on the theophany 
which marked the baptism of Jesus. 

The 4th century marks the culmination of early Christian 
preaching. The imperial patronage had made education and 
social distinctions a greater possibility for the preacher, and the 
decline of political eloquence furnished an opening for pulpit 
oratory. The didactic element was no longer in sole possession 
of the field, for the inrush of multitudes to the Christian faith 
and the building of large churches necessitated a return to the 
evangelical or proclamatory type of sermon. It was the age 
of doctrinal controversy, and the intellectual presentation of 
the Christian position was thus sharpened and developed. The 
Antiochene school had set a worthy example of careful exegesis 
of scripture. It was in the East especially that preaching 
flourished: Eusebius of Caesarea, Eusebius of Emesa, Athanasius, 
Macarius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Ephraem Syrus among the ortho- 
dox; and of the Arians, Arius himself and Ulfilas the great 
Gothic missionary, are all of high quality; but above even these 
stand out the three Cappadocians,Basil (q.v.) of Caesarea,cultured, 
devout and practical; his brother Gregory (q.v.) of Nyssa, more 
inclined to the speculative and metaphysical, and Gregory (q.v.) 
of Nazianzus, richly endowed with poetic and oratorial gifts, 
the finest preacher of the three. At the apex of the pyramid 
stands John of Antioch, Chrysostom (q.v.), who in 387, at the 
age of 40, began his 1 2 years' ministry in his native city and in 
399, the six memorable years in Constantinople, where he loved

PREACHING 



the poor, withstood tyranny and preached with amazing power. 
His sermons, says Dr E. C. Dargan, " show the native oratorical 
instinct highly trained by study and practice, a careful and 
sensible (not greatly allegorical) interpretation of Scripture, a 
deep concern for the spiritual welfare of his charge, and a 
thorough consecration to his work. His style is impetuous, 
rich, torrential at times; his thought is practical and imaginative 
rather than deeply philosophical. His knowledge of human 
nature is keen and ample, and. his sermons are a remarkable 
reflection of the manners and customs of his age. His ethical 
appeal is constant and stimulating." 

In the West the allegorical method of Alexander had more 
influence than the historical exegesis of Antioch. This is seen 
in Ambrose of Milan, with whom may be named Hilary of 
Poitiers and Gaudentius of Brescia, the friend of Chrysostom, 
and a link between him and Ambrose. But the only name of 
first rank in preaching is that of Augustine, and even he is 
curiously unequal. His fondness for the allegorical and his 
manifest carelessness of preparation disappoint as often as his 
profundity, his devout mysticisms, his practical application 
attract and satisfy. Augustine's De doctrina Christiana, bk. iv., 
is the first attempt to formulate the principles of homiletics. 

2. The Early Middle Ages, 430-1100. — After the days of 
Chrysostom and Augustine there was a great decline of preaching. 
With the poor exceptions of one or two names like those of 
Theodore of Mopsuestia and John of Damascus, the Eastern 
Church produced no preachers of distinction. The causes of 
the ebb were both internal and external. Within the Church 
there was a departure from the great experimental truths of 
the Gospel, their place being taken by the preaching of nature 
and morality on a theistic basis. To this we may add a fantastic 
and absurd allegorization, the indiscriminate laudation of saints 
and martyrs, polemical strife,'the hardening of the doctrine into 
dogma, the development of a narrow ecclesiasticism, and the 
failure of the missionary spirit in the orthodox section of the 
Eastern Church (as contrasted with the marvellous evangelistic 
activity of the Nestorians (</.».). Outside the Church the Break- 
up of old civilizations, the confused beginnings of medieval 
kingdoms, with the attendant war and rapine, the inroads of 
the Saracens and the rise of Islam, were all effective silencers 
of the pulpit. Yet the night was not without its stars; at Rome 
Leo the Great and Gregory the Great could preach, and the 
missionaries Patrick, Columba, Columbanus, Augustine, Wilfrid, 
Willibrord, Gall and Boniface are known by their fruits. The 
homilies of Beda are marked by a tender devoutness, and here 
and there rise to glowing eloquence. In the 8th century 
Charlemagne, through the Capitularies , tried in vain to galvanize 
preaching; such specimens as we have show the sermons of the 
times to he marked hy superstition, ignorance, formality and 
plagiarism. It was the age when the papacy was growing out 
of the ruins of the old Roman Empire, and the best talents were 
devoted to the organization of ecclesiasticism rather than to the 
preaching of the Word. Liturgies were taking shape, penance 
was deemed of more importance than repentance, and there 
was more insistence on discipline than on Christian morality. 
Towards the end of the period we note the beginnings of the triple 
division of medieval preaching into cloistral, parochial and 
missionary or popular preaching, a division based at first on 
audiences rather than on subject-matter, the general character 
of which — legends and popular stories rather than exposition 
of Scripture — was much the same everywhere. About this 
time, no doubt, some preachers began to use the vernacular, 
though no examples of such a practice have been preserved. 
There are few great names in the 9th, 10th and nth centuries: 
Anselm was a great Churchman, but no great preacher; perhaps 
the most worthy of mention is Anskar, the missionary to the 
Scandinavians. Rabanus Maurus published an adaptation of 
Augustine's De doctrina Christiana, bk. iv. But certain forces were 
at work which were destined to bring about a great revival, viz. 
the rise of the scholastic theology, the reforms of Pope Hilde- 
brand, and the preaching of the First Crusade by Pope Urban II. 
(d. 1099) and Peter the Hermit. 



3. The Later Medieval Age, 1100-1500. — In the 12th century 
the significant feature is the growing use of the various national 
languages in competition with the hitherto universal Latin. 
The most eminent preacher of the century was Bernard of 
Clairvaux (1091-1153), esteemed alike by gentle and simple, 
and summing up the popular scholastic and mystical types of 
preaching. His homilies, though tediously minute, still breathe 
a charm and power (see Bernard, St). 

Alongside Bernard may he placed the two mystics of St Victor, 
Hugo and Richard, and a little later Peter Waldo of Lyons, who, 
like Henry of Lausanne, preached a plain message to the poor 
and lowly. The 13th century saw the culmination of medieval 
preaching, especially in the rise of the two great mendicant 
orders of Francis and Dominic. Representative Franciscan 
names are Antony of Padua (d. 1 231), who travelled and preached 
through southern Europe; Berthold of Regensburg (d. 1272), 
who, with his wit and pathos, imagination and insight, drew 
huge crowds all over Germany, as in homeliest vernacular he 
denounced sin with all the severity of a John the Baptist; and 
Francis -Bonaventura, the schoolman and mystic, who wrote a 
little book on The Art of Preaching. Of the Dominicans Thomas 
Aquinas (d. 1274), the theologian, was perhaps also the greatest 
preacher. With the 14th century a new note, that of reformation, 
is struck; but on the whole there was a drop from the high level 
of the 13th. In Italy Bernardino of Siena on the scholastic 
side, Robert of Lecce and Gabriel Barletta on the popular, are 
the chief names; in Germany these phases are represented by 
John Gritsch and John Geiler of Kaiserburg respectively. 
Among the popular preachers vigour was often blended with 
coarseness and vulgarity. Mysticism is represented by Suso, 
Meister Eckhart, above all Johann Tauler (q.v.) of Strassburg 
(d. 1461), a true prophet in an age of degeneration. Towards 
the close of the century comes John Wycliffe (q.v.) and his 
English travelling preachers, who passed the torch to Hus 
and the Bohemians, and in the next age Savonarola, who was 
to Florence what Jeremiah had been to Jerusalem. 

4. The Reformation Period, 1500-ijoo. — It is here that the 
story of modern preaching may be said to begin. The Reformers 
gave the sermon a higher place in the ordinary service than it 
had previously held, and they laid special stress upon the 
interpretation and application of Scripture. The controversy 
with Rome, and the appeal to the reason and conscience of the 
individual, together with the spread of the New Learning, gave 
preaching a new force and influence which reacted upon the old 
faith, as John Wild (d. 1554), one of the best Roman Catholic 
preachers of the day, a man noted for his " emphasis on Scripture, 
his grasp of evangelical truth, his earnest piety, amiable character 
and sustained power in the pulpit," fully admitted. Other 
famous preachers on the same side were the Spaniards Luiz of 
Granada and Thomas of Villanova, the Italians Cornelio Musso, • 
Egidio of Viterbo and Carlo Borromeo, and the German Peter 
Canisius. Among the Reformers were, of course, Martin Luther 
and most of his German collaborators; the Swiss Zwingli, Bui- * 
linger, Farel and Calvin; the English Latimer, John Bradford, 
John Jewel; the Scot John Knox. Nor can even so cursory 
a sketch omit to mention Bernardino Ochino and the Anabaptist 
Hiibmaier. In all these cases fuller details will be found in the 
articles bearing their names. Most of the Reformation preachers 
read their sermons, in contrast to the practice of earlier ages. 
The English Book of Homilies was compiled because competent 
preachers were comparatively rare. 

The 17th-century preaching was, generally speaking, a continu- 
ation of that of the 16th century, the pattern having been set 
by the Council of Trent and by the principles and practice of 
the Reformers. In Spain and Germany, however, there was 
a decline of power, in marked contrast to the vigour manifested 
in France and England. In France, indeed, the Catholic pulpit 
now came to its perfection, stimulated, no doubt, by the toleration 
accorded to the Huguenots up to 1685 and hy the patronage 
of Louis XIV. The names of Bossuet, Flechier, Bourdaloue, • 
Fenelon and Massillon, all supreme preachers, despite a certain 
artificial pompousness, belong here, and on the reformed side

arc Jean Claude (d. 1687), author of the Essay on the Sermon, 
and Jacques Saurin (d. 1730). In England the rivalry was not 
between Catholic and Reformer, but between Anglican and 
Nonconformist, or, if we may use the wide but less correct term, 
Puritan. On the one hand arc Andrewes, Hall, Chillingworth, 
Jeremy Taylor, Barrow and South; on the other Baxter, Calamy, 
the Goodwins, Howe, Owen, Bunyan, in each case but a few 
names out of many. The sermons of these men were largely 
scriptural, the cardinal evangelical truths being emphasized with 
reality and vigour, but with a tendency to abstract theology 
rather than concrete religion. The danger was felt by the 
university of Cambridge, which in 1674 passed a statute for- 
bidding its preachers to read their sermons. 

Germany, harassed by the Thirty Years' War and deadened 
by a rigid Lutheranism, can show little besides Andrea and 
Johann Amdt until the coming of the Pietists (sec Pietism), 
A. H. Francke and Philipp Spencer, with Paul Gerhardt and 
his cousin Johann. The early years of the 18th century were a 
time of deadness as regards preaching. The Illumination in 
Germany and Deism in England were largely responsible for 
this, though the names of J. A. Bcngel (better known as a 
commentator), Zinzendorf, Butler and the Erskines helped to 
redeem the time from the reproach of being the dark age of 
Protestantism. In the Roman Catholic Church the greatest 
force was Bridaine in France, a popular preacher of high worth. 
But, generally speaking, there was no heart in preaching, sermons 
were unimpassioned, stilted and formal presentations of ethics 
and apologetics, seldom delivered extempore. 

5. The Modem Period may be said to begin in 1738, the year 
in which John Wesley began his memorable work. Preaching 
once more was based on the Bible, which was expounded with 
force and earnestness, and though throughout the century there 
remained a good many pulpiteers who produced nothing but 
solemn fudge, the example and stimulus given by Wesley and 
Whitefield were almost immeasurably productive. Whitefield 
was the greater orator, Wesley the better thinker; but, diverse 
in temperament as they were, they alike laid emphasis on open- 
air preaching. In their train came the great field preachers 
of Wales, like John Elias and Christmas Evans, and later the 
Primitive Methodists, who by their camp meetings and itiner- 
ancies kept religious enthusiasm alive when Wesleyan Methodism 
was in peril of hardening. Meanwhile, in America the Puritan 
tradition, adapted to the new conditions, is represented by Cotton 
Mather, and later by Jonathan Edwards, the greatest preacher 
of his time and country. Whitefield 's visits raised a band 
of pioneer preachers, cultured and uncultured, men who knew 
their Bibles but often interpreted them awry. 

In the early 19th century the pulpit had a great power, 
especially in Wales, where it was the vehicle of almost every 
kind of knowledge. And it may be doubted whether, all in all, 
preaching has ever reached so uniformly high a level or been so 
powerful a force as during the 19th century, and this in spite 
of other forces similarly making for enlightenment and morality. 
It shared to the full in all the quickening that transformed so 
many departments of civilization during that epoch, and has 
been specially influenced by the missionary enterprise, the 
discoveries of science, the fuller knowledge of the Bible, the 
awakened zeal for social service. Modem preaching, like ancient 
preaching, has been so varied, depending, as it so largely does, on 
the personality of the preacher, that it is not possible to speak 
of its characteristics. Nor can one do more than enumerate 
a few outstanding modern names, exclusive of living preachers. 
In the Roman Catholic Church are the Italians Ventura and Curci, 
the Germans Diepenbrock and Foerster, the French Lacordaire, 
Dupanloup, Loyson (P£re Hyacinthe) and Henri Didon. Of 
Protestants, Germany produced Schleiermacher, Claus Harms, 
Tholuck and F. W. Krummacher; France, Vinet and the Monods. 
In England representative Anglican preachers were Newman 
(whose best preaching preceded his obedience to Rome), T. 
Arnold, F. W. Robertson, Liddon, Farrar, Magee; of Free Church- 
men, T. Binney, Thomas Jones, R. W. Dale and Joseph Parker 
(Congregationalist) ; Robert Hall, C. H. Spurgeon and Alexander 



Maclaren (Baptists); W. M. Punshon, Hugh Price Hughes and 
Peter Mackenzie (Wesleyan); James Martineau (Unitarian). 
The Scottish Churches gave Edward Irving, Thos. Chalmers, 
R. S. Candlish, R. M. McCheyne and John Caird. In America, 
honoured names are those of W. E. Channing, Henry Ward 
Beccher, Horace Bushnell, Phillips Brooks, to mention only 
a few.

PREAMBLE (Med. Lat. praeambulum, from praeambulare, to 
walk before), an introductory statement, a preliminary explana- 
tion. The term is particularly applied to the opening paragraph 
of a statute which summarizes the intention of tbe legislature 
in passing the measure; thus the preamble of the statute, of 
which the title is the Children Act 1908, is as follows: " An 
Act to consolidate and amend the Law relating to the Protection 
of Children and Young Persons, Reformatory and Industrial 
Schools and Juvenile Offenders, and otherwise to amend the 
Law with respect to Children and Young Persons." The 
procedure in the British parliament differs in regard to the 
preambles of public and private bills. The second reading of 
a public bill affirms the principle, and therefore in committee 
the preamble stands postponed till after the consideration of 
the clauses, when it is considered in reference to those clauses 
as amended and altered if need be (Standing Order 35). On 
the other hand, the preamble of a private bill, if opposed, is 
considered first in committee, and counsel for the bill deals with 
the expediency of the bill, calls witnesses for the allegation in 
the preamble, and petitions against the bill are then heard; if 
the preamble is negatived the bill is dropped, if affirmed it is 
gone through clause by clause. On unopposed private bills 
the preamble has also to be proved, more especially with regard 
to whether the clauses required by the standing orders are 
inserted (see May, Parliamentary Practice, 1906, pp. 483, 808 seq.). 

PREANGER, a residency of the island of Java, Dutch East 
Indies, bounded S. by the Indian Ocean, W. by Bantam, N. by 
Batavia and Krawang, and N.E. and E. by Cheribon and 
Banyumas. It is officially termed the Preanger Regencies, of 
which there are five, covering the several administrative divisions. 
It also includes the small island of Nusa Were. The natives 
are Sudanese. The whole residency is mountainous, but there are 
two main parallel ranges of peaks along the northern boundary 
and through the middle. Among these are to be found a singu- 
larly large number of both active and inactive volcanoes, includ- 
ing the well-known Salak and Gede in the north, and bundled 
together at the eastern end the Chikorai, Papandayan, Wayang, 
Malabar, Guntur, &c, ranging from 6000 to 10,000 ft. in height. 
The rivers of the province belong to the basins of the Indian 
Ocean and the Java Sea respectively, the water-parting being 
formed by the western and eastern ends respectively of the 
northern and southern lines of mountain peaks. The two which 
drain the largest basin are the Chi Manuk and the Chi Tarum, 
both rising in the eastern end of the province and flowing north- 
east and north-west respectively to the Java Sea. The Chi 
Tandui, also rising here, flows south-east to the Indian Ocean, 
and alone of all the rivers in this province is navigable. Large 
stretches of marsh occur on each side of this river, as well as 
here and there among the hills where inland lakes formerly 
existed, as, for instance, near Bandung. Crater lakes are Telaga 
(lake) Budas, in the crater of the volcano of the same name 
in the south-east, and Telaga Wama, on the slopes of the Gede, 
famous for its beautiful tinting. On the same side of the Gede is 
the health resort of Sindanglaya (founded 1850-1860), with a 
mineral spring containing salt, and close by is the country 
residence of Cbipanas, belonging to the governor-generaL 

Numerous warm springs are scattered about this volcanic 
region. Petroleum and coal have been worked, and there is a rich 
yield of chalk, while a good quality of bricks is made from the

red clay. The soil is in general very fertile, the principal products 
being rice, maize and pulse (kachang) in the lower grounds, and 
cinchona, coffee and tea, as well as cocoa, tobacco and fibrous 
plants in the hills. The coffee cultivation has, however, consider- 
ably diminished. Forest culture, mat-making, weaving and 
fish-breeding are also practised, the last-named in the marshes 
after the rice harvest. The plantations are almost entirely 
owned by the government and Europeans, but the rice mills 
are in the hands of Chinese. Irrigation works have been carried 
out in various parts. The principal towns are Bandung, the 
capital of the residency, Sukabumi, Chianjar, Sumedang, 
Chichalengka, Garut, Tasik Malaya and Manon Jay a, all with 
the exception of Sumedang connected by railway. 

PREBENDARY (Lat. praebendo = give or grant, through 
Low Lat. praebenda)^ one who holds a prebend, namely an 
endowment in land, or pension in money, given to a cathedral or 
conventual church in praebendam — that is, for the maintenance 
of a secular priest or regular canon. In the early Church the 
title had a more general signification. The word praebenda 
originally signified the daily rations given to soldiers, whence 
it passed to indicate daily distributions of food and drink to 
monks, canons, &c. It became a frequent custom to grant 
such a prebend from the resources of a monastery to certain 
poor people or to the founder. Such persons were, literally, 
prebendaries. At a later date, when the custom in collegiate 
churches of h'ving in common had become less general, a certain 
amount of the church revenue was divided among the clergy 
serving such a church, and each portion (no longer of meat or 
drink only) was called a prebend. The clergy of such churches 
were generally canons, and the titles canon and prebendary were, 
and are, sometimes used as synonymous. A member of such 
a college is a canon in virtue of the spiritual duties which he 
has to perform, and the assignation to him of a stall in choir and 
a place in chapter; he is a prebendary in virtue of his benefice. 
In the Roman Catholic Church the duties of a prebendary as 
such generally consist in his attendance at choral office in his 
church. In the Anglican Church he usually bears his part in 
the conducting of the ordinary church services, except when he 
has a vicar, as in the old cathedral foundations (see Cathedral). 
A prebendary may be either simple or a dignitary. In the former 
case he has no cure and no more than his revenue for his support; 
in the latter he has always a jurisdiction annexed. In the 
Anglican Church the bishop is of common right patron of all 
prebends, and if a prebend is in the gift of a lay patron he must 
present his candidate to the bishop who institutes as to other 
benefices. No person may hold more than one prebend in the 
same church; therefore, if a prebendary accepts a deanery in his 
church his prebend becomes void by cession. A prebend is 
practically a sinecure, and the holder has no cure of souls as 
such. He may, and often does, accept a parochial office or 
chaplaincy in addition. 

In the middle ages there were many less regular kinds of prebends: 
e.g. praebenda doctoralis, with which teaching duties were connected, 
praebenda lector alts, praebenda missae, to which the duty of saying 
a certain number of masses was attached, praebenda mortuaria, 
founded for the saying of masses for the dead. Chantries belonged 
to this class. AH these prebends were generally assigned to special 
holders, but there were also praebendae currentes, which were not held 
by any persons in particular. Sometimes prebends were held by 
boys who sang in choir, praebendae pueriles. Occasionally the name 
of prebendary was applied to those servants in a monastery who 
attended to the food. In England the word prebendary was^ some- 
times used as synonymous with prebend, as prebend was occasionally 
used for prebendary.

PRE-CAMBRIAN, in geology, the enormously long and 
indistinctly denned period of time anterior to the Cambrian 
period. In the restricted sense in which it is now often employed 
it embraces a period or group of periods subsequent to the 
Archean (q.v.) and anterior to the Cambrian, although some 
writers still prefer to include the former. The superior limit 
of pre- Cambrian rocks is fixed by the Olenellus fauna at the base 



of the Cambrian (some geologists speak of certain pre-OIenellus 
beds as eo-Cambrian) ; the lower limit has not yet been generally 
established, though it is sufficiently clear in certain regions. 
The rocks of this period are much more obviously of sedimentary 
origin than those of the Archean; they include conglomerates, 
sandstones, greywackes, quartzites, slates, limestones and 
dolomites, which appear to have been formed under conditions 
similar to those which obtained in later epochs. Although the 
sediments prevail, they are often very highly metamorphosed 
and distorted by crustal movements; igneous rocks occur in 
great bulk in some regions. Fossils are usually extremely rare 
and very ill-preserved; but indications of protozoa, coelenterates, 
echinoderms, molluscoids, mollusca, worms and arthropods have 
been distinguished. The name pre-Cambrian is the equivalent 
of the " Algonkian " of the United States Geological Survey, 
and of the " Proterozoic " of other American authorities; the 
terms eozoic, archaeozoic, agnotozoic, crypt ozoic, eparchaic and 
others have also been applied to the same period. 

Three or more great stratigraphical breaks have been recog- 
nized within the system of pre-Cambrian rocks; but how far 
these breaks synchronize in widely separated regions where they 
are found is difficult to determine in the absence of good palae- 
ontological evidence. 

The most striking development of pre-Cambrian rocks in Great 
Britain is the Torridonian (q.v.) group of the north-west highlands 
of Scotland, which lies with strong unconformability between the 
Lewisian gneiss and the basal quartzite of the Cambrian. The 
Eastern or Dalradian (q.v.) schists of Scotland and their equivalents 
in Ireland and Anglesey may be, in part at least, of the same age. 
In Shropshire, in the neighbourhood of the Welsh border, is the 
remnant of an ancient ridge now forming the Longmynd and the 
smaller hills to the west, Caer Caradoc, the Wrekin, and the Carding- 
ton Hills. The latter are built mainly of much altered porphyries 
and tuffs which C. Callaway named the Uriconian series; this series 
is clearly of pre-Cambrian age. The great mass of grits, flags and 
slates forming the Longmynd cannot yet be definitely assigned to 
this period, though they may be provisionally retained here under 
Callaway's name, Londmyndian. Probably contemporaneous with 
the Uriconian are the volcanic series of Barnt Green, Licky Hill and 
Caldecote. The micaceous schists of Rush ton (Salop) may be placed 
here. In the Charnwood Forest a group of crystalline rocks, named 
Charnian by \V. \V. Watts, rises up in the form of small hills amid 
the surrounding Trias; they are classed as follows in descending 
order: The Brand series, including the slates of Swithland and 
Groby, quartzite and conglomerate and purple and green beds; the 
Maplewell series, including the olive hornstones of Bradgate, the 
Woodhouse beds, the slate-agglomerate of Roecliffe, the Beacon 
Hill hornstones and a felspathic agglomerate; and the Blackbrook 
series of grits and hornstones. The ancient volcanic rocks of St 
Davids, Pembrokeshire, were formerly regarded by H. Hicks as of 
pre-Cambrian age, in which he recognized a lower, " Dimetian," a 
middle, " Arvonian," and an upper, " Pebidian," series. The pre- 
Cambrian age of these rocks was for a long time disputed, but 
J. F. N. Green (Q. J. Geol. Soc. } 1908, 64, p. 363) made it clear that 
there is an Upper Pebidian (Rhyofitic group), and a Lower Pebidian 
(Trachytic group), and that Hicks's " Dimetian," the St Davids 
granophyre, is a laccolitic mass intrusive in the Pebidian. Both 
the Pebidian volcanic rocks and the intruded granophyre are 
separated from the Cambrian by an unconformity. 

In Finno-Scandinavia pre-Cambrian rocks are well developed. In 
the Scandinavian mountain ranges are the Seve and Sparagmite 
formations; the latter, a coarse-grained felspathic sandstone, is very 
similar to the Torridonian of Scotland ; it occurs also in Enontekis 
in Finland. Next in descending order come the Jotnian sandstones 
(2000 metres), which retain ripple-marks; they are associated with 
conglomerates and slates and intrusive diabase and the Rapakiwi 
granite. The Jotnian group rests unconformably upon the Jatulian 
quartzites and schists, with slates, dolomite and carbonaceous beds 
(north of Lake Onega is a bed of anthracite 2 metres thick). Out- 
flows of diabase and gabbro occur in this series, which is from 1600 
to 2000 metres in thickness. Below the Jatulian is another group 
of schistose sediments, the Kalevian, more strongly folded than 
the former and separated from the groups above and below by 
unconformable junctions. These rocks are regarded by J. J. 
Sederholm as older than the Huronian of North America (possibly 
analogous to the Keewatin formation), and yet several groups of 
sediments in this region (Botnian schists, &c.) lie between the 
Kalevian series and the granitic (Archean) complex. 

Pre-Cambrian rocks occupy large areas and attain an enormous 
thickness in North America; all types of sediment are represented 
in various stages of metamorphism, and with these are igneous rocks, 
often developed upon a vast scale. They have been subdivided 
into the following groups or formations: an upper Kewecnawan 



PRECARIOUS— PRECEDENCE 



267 



and a lower Huronian group; the latter is subdivided into an 
upper Animikean (north-east Minnesota) or Pcnokean (north-west 
Wisconsin); a middle and a lower division. Each of these four 
groups is separated by marked unconformity from the rocks above 
and below. Huronian rocks are well developed in the following 
districts: the Marquette region of northern Michigan.^ comprising 
quartzites, slates and conglomerates, with important iron-bearing 
slates and schists and ferruginous cherts; in the Menominee district 
of Michigan and Wisconsin similar rocks occur; the Penokee-Gogcbic 
district of Wisconsin and Michigan comprises quartzites, shales and 
limestones, with beds and dikes of diabase and^ olivine-gabbro; 
the same rocks occur in the Crystal Falls, north Michigan ; the Mesabi 
and Vermilion districts, Minnesota, and north of Lake Michigan 
rock groups of this age take an important place. The valuable iron 
ores of Mesabi, Penokce-Gogeblc and Menominee belong mainly to 
the Animikean group; in the Penokee rocks of this age vast 
thicknesses of igneous rocks constitute the greater part of the 
formation. The Keweenawan rocks are said to attain the enormous 
thickness of 50,000 ft.; the higher beds are mainly sandy sediments 
and conglomerates; in the lower portions are great igneous masses, 
gabbros, diabase and porphyries; thus in the St Croix valley, north- 
west Wisconsin and Minnesota, no fewer than 65 lava flows and 5 
conglomeratic beds have been counted, which together aggregate 
some 20,000 ft. in thickness. Some of these lava flows appear to 
have been due to fissure eruptions. The native copper deposits of 
this age in north Michigan are the most extensive known. 

Pre-Cambrian rocks occupy large areas and reach great thicknesses 
in the eastern provinces of Canada; in Newfoundland 10,000 ft. of 
strata lie between the Archean and Cambrian (the Tcrranovian scries 
of South Hunt; Avalon group of others); similar rocks occur also 
north of the Great Lakes and in the Hudson Bay^ region. They are 
found also in great force in the Colorado Canyon, in the Adirondack 
Mountains, and Black Hills of S. Dakota and elsewhere. 

Turning to Europe, we find pre-Cambrian rocks in Brittany, the 
" phyllades de Saint L6," or Briovcrian of Chas. Barrois;and along 
the western border of France and south-west of the central massif. 
In the Fichtelgebirge, the Silesian mountains and east Thuringia 
similar rocks occur; the Przibramcr Schicfer of Lipoid and rocks 
in J. Barrande's stage A are of this age. Probably the metamor- 
phosed eruptive rocks on the southern border of the Hunsriick and 
Taunus are pre-Cambrian. Large tracts of metamorphic sedimentary 
rocks that may be classed here are found in Shantung and north 
China, and probably also in Brazil, India and Australia. In South 
Africa the gold-bearing Witwatersrand beds of the Transvaal and 
the overlying Ventersdorp and Potchefstroom systems; the Griqua- 
land system and Cango and Ibeques systems of Cape Colony, all 
occur above Archean rocks and below those of Devonian aeej they 
cannot as yet ^therefore' be classed as pre-Cambrian and tneir age 
is still uncertain. 

Little can be said of the climatic conditions of this remote 
period, the fossil evidence being so poor; but it is of interest 
to note that in certain regions, viz. in the Lake Huron region, 
in the Gaisa series of Varanger Fjord, Norway, and in the 
Yangtse district in China, conglomerate beds are found in which 
many of the boulders are scratched like those of theDwyka beds 
of South Africa, and thus suggest the possibility of glacial 
conditions at some stages of the period.

PRECARIOUS, literally, held on the good-will of another, or 
on entreaty (Lat. prex, precis, prayer) to another. The word is 
used, in law, of a tenure of land, office, &c, held at the pleasure 
of another. In general usage it has the significance of something 
uncertain, dangerous or risky. 

PRECEDENCE (from Lat. praecedere, to go before, precede). 
This word in the sense in which it is here employed means 
priority of place, or superiority of rank, in the conventional 
system of arrangement under which the more eminent and 
dignified orders of the community are classified on occasions of 
public ceremony and in the intercourse of private life.. In the 
United Kingdom there is no complete and comprehensive code 
whereby the scheme of social gradation has been defined and 
settled, once and for all, on a sure and lasting foundation. The 
principles and rules at present controlling it have been formulated 
at different periods and have been derived from various sources. 
The Crown is the fountain of honour, and it is its undoubted 
prerogative to confer on any of its subjects, in any part of its 
dominions, such titles and distinctions and such rank and place 
as to it may seem meet and convenient. Its discretion in this 
respect is altogether unbounded at common law, and is limited 
in those cases only wherein it has been submitted to restraint 



by act of parliament. In the old time all questions of precedence 
came in the ordinary course of things within the jurisdiction of 
the court of chivalry, in which the lord high constable and earl 
marshal presided as judges, and of which the kings of arms, 
heralds and pursuivants were the assessors and executive 
officers. When, however, points of unusual moment and magni- 
tude happened to be brought into controversy, they were 
occasionally considered and decided by the sovereign in person, 
or by a special commission, or by the privy council, or even by 
the parliament itself. But it was not until towards the middle 
of the 16th century that precedence was made the subject of 
any legislation in the proper meaning of the term. 1 

In 1539 an act " for the placing of the Lords in Parliament " 
(31 Hen. VIII. c. 10) was passed at the instance of the king, and 
by it the relative rank of the members of the royal family, of tbe 
great officers of state and the household, and of the hierarchy 
and the peerage was definitely and definitively ascertained. In 
1563 an act "for declaring the authority of the Lord Keeper 
of the Great Seal and the Lord Chancellor to be the same" 
(5 Eliz. c. 18) also declared their precedence to be the same. 
Questions concerning the precedence of peers are mentioned 
in the Lords Journals 4 & 5 Ph. and M. and 39 Eliz., but in the 
reign of James I. such questions were often referred to the 
commissioners for executing the office of earl marshal. In the 
reign of Charles I. the House of Lords considered several ques- 
tions of precedency and objected in the earl of Banbury's case 
to warrants overruling the statute of 31 Hen. VIII. In 1689 an 
act " for enabling Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal to 
execute the office of Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper " (1 Will, 
and Mary c. 21) gave to the commissioners not being peers of 
the realm place next to the speaker of the House of Commons 
and to the speaker place next to the peers of the realm. In 
1707 the Act of Union with Scotland (6 Anne c. 11) provided 
that all peers of Scotland should be peers of Great Britain 2 and 
should have rank immediately after the peers of the like degrees 
in England at the time of the union and before all peers of Great 
Britain of the like degrees created after the union. In 1800 the 
Act of Union with Ireland (39 & 40 Geo. III. c. 67) provided 
that the lords spiritual of Ireland should have rank immediately 
after the lords spiritual of the same degree in Great Britain, and 
that the lords temporal of Ireland should have rank immediately 
after the lords temporal of the same degree in Great Britain at 
the time of the union, and further that " peerages of Ireland 
created after the union should have precedence with peerages 
of the United Kingdom created after the union according to 
the dates of their creation." At different times too during the 
current century several statutes have been passed for the reform 
and extension of the judicial organization which have very 
materially affected the precedence of the judges, more especially 
the Judicature Act of 1873 (36 & 37 Vict. c. 66), under which 
the lords justices of appeal and the justices of the High Court 
now receive their appointments. But the statute of Henry VIII. 
" for the placing of the Lords " still remains the only legislative 
measure in which it has been attempted to deal directly and 
systematically with any large and important section of the scale 
of general precedence; and the law, so far as it relates to the 
ranking of the sovereign's immediate kindred whether lineal or 
collateral, the principal ministers of the Crown and court, and 
both the spiritual and temporal members of the House of Lords, 
is to all practical intents and purposes what it was made by that 
statute nearly 350 years ago. Where no act of parliament applies 
precedence is determined either by the will and pleasure of the sov- 
ereign or by what is accepted as " ancient usage and established

who are desirous of investigating the history of precedence under its 
wider and more remote aspects will be found in such writers as 
Selden or Mackenzie, together with the authorities quoted or referred

custom." Of the sovereign's will and pleasure the appropri- 
ate method of announcement is by warrant under the sign- 
manual, or letters patent under the great seal. But, although 
the Crown has at all periods very frequently conceded special 
privileges of rank and place to particular persons, its interference 
with the scale of general precedence has been rare and excep- 
tional. In 1540 it was provided by warrant from Henry VIII. 
that certain officers of the household therein named should 
precede the secretaries of state when and if they were under 
the degree of barons. 1 In 161 2 James I. directed by letters 
patent, not without long and elaborate argument in the Star 
Chamber, that baronets, then newly created, should be ranked 
after the younger sons of viscounts and barons, and that a 
number of political and judicial functionaries should be ranked 
between knights of the Garter and such knights bannerets as 
should be made by the sovereign in person " under his standard 
displayed in an army* royal in open war." 2 Four years later 
he further directed, also by letters patent, that the sons of 
baronets and their wives and the daughters of baronets should 
be placed before the sons of knights and their wives and the 
daughters of knights " of what degree or order soever." 3 And 
again in 1620 the same king commanded by warrant " after 

* solemn argument before his majesty " that the younger sons of 
earls should precede knights of the privy council and knights 
of the Garter not being "barons or of a higher degree." 4 If 
we add to these ordinances the provisions relating to precedence 
contained in the statutes of several of the orders of knighthood 
which since then have been instituted or reconstructed, we shall 
nearly, if not quite, exhaust the catalogue of the interpositions 
of the sovereign with regard to the rank and place of classes 
as distinguished from individuals. Of " ancient usage and 
established custom " the records of the College of Arms furnish 
the fullest and most trustworthy evidence. Among them in 
particular there is a collection of early tables of precedence 
which were published by authority at intervals from the end of 
the 14th to the end of the 15th century, and to which peculiar 
weight has been attached by many successive generations of 
heralds. On them, indeed, as illustrative of and supplementary 
to the action of parliament and the Crown, all subsequent tables 
of precedence have been in great measure founded. The oldest 
is the " Order of All Estates of Nobles and Gentry," prepared 
apparently for the coronation of Henry IV. in 1399, under the 
supervision of Ralph Nevill, earl of Westmorland and earl 
marshal; and the next is the " Order of All States of Worship 
and Gentry," prepared, as announced in the heading, for the 
coronation of Henry VI. in 1429, under the supervision of the 
lord protector Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and the earl 
marshal, John Mowbray, duke of Norfolk. Two more are of 
the reign of Edward IV., and were severally issued by John 
Tiptoft, earl of Worcester and lord high constable, in 1467, and 
by Anthony Widvile, Earl Rivers and lord high constable, in 
1479. The latest is commonly and shortly known as the " Series 
Ordinum," and was drawn up by a special commission presided 
over by Jasper Tudor, duke of Bedford, it is presumed for 
observance at the marriage of Henry VII. and Elizabeth of 
York in i486. To these may be added the " Order for the 
Placing of Lords and Ladies," taken at a grand entertainment 
given by command of Henry VIII. at the king's manor-house of 
Richmond in 1520 by Charles Somerset, earl of Worcester, lord 

* chamberlain of the household, to the French ambassador, 
Olivier de la Vernade, seigneur de la Batie; the " Precedency 
of All Estates," arranged in 1594 by the commissioners for

Honor, pt. ii. p. 750).

executing the office of earl marshal; and the " Roll of the King's 
Majesty's most Royal Proceeding through London " from the 
Tower to Whitehall on the eve of the coronation of James I., 
also arranged by the commissioners for executing the office of 
earl marshal. On many isolated points, too, of more or less 
importance, special declaratory decisions have been from time 
to time propounded by the earls marshal, their substitutes and 
deputies; for example, in 1594, when the younger sons of dukes 
were placed before viscounts; in 1625, when' the rank of knights 
of the Bath and their wives was fixed; and in 161 5 and 1677, 
when the eldest sons of the younger sons of peers were placed 
before the eldest sons of knights and of baronets. It is from 
these miscellaneous sources that the precedence among others 
of all peeresses, the eldest sons and their wives and the daughters 
of all peers, and the younger sons and their wives of all dukes, 
marquesses and earls is ascertained and established. And 
further, for the purpose of proving continuity of practice and 
disposing of minor questions not otherwise and more conclusively 
set at rest, the official programmes and accounts preserved by 
the heralds of different public solemnities and processions, such 
as coronations, royal marriages, state funerals, national thanks- 
givings and so on, have always been considered to be of great 
historical and technical value. 5

8 The precedence of the members of the royal family depends on 
their relationship to the reigning sovereign and not on their relation- 
ship to any of the predecessors of the reigning sovereign. It is pro- 
vided by 31 Hen. VIII. c. 10 that no person, " except only the King's 
children/ shall have place " at the side of the Cloth of Estate in the 
Parliament Chamber, and that " the King's Son, the King's Brother, 
the King's Nephew, or the King's Brother's or Sister's Sons," shall 
have place before all prelates, ^reat officers of state and peers. Lord 
Chief Justice Coke was of opinion that the king's nephew meant the 
king's grandson or nepos {Institutes, vol. iv. ch. 77). But, as Mr Justice 
Blackstone says, " under the description of the King's children his 
grandsons are held to be included without having recourse to Sir 
Edward Coke's interpretation of nephew " (Commentaries t vol. i. ch. 4). 
Besides, if grandson is to be understood by nephew, the king's grand- 
son would be placed after the king's brother. The prince of Wales 
is not specifically mentioned in the statute " for the placing of the 
Lords " ; but, as he is always, whether the son or the grandson of the 
sovereign, the heir-apparent to the Crown, he is ranked next to the 
sovereign or the queen-consort. With the exception of the prince of 
Wales, all the male relations of the sovereign are ranked first in the 
order of their degrees of consanguinity with him or her, and secondly, 
in the order of their proximity to the succession to the Crown; thus 
the members of the several groups into which the royal family is 
divided take precedence according to their own seniority and the 
seniority of their fathers or mothers, the sons of the sons or brothers 
of the sovereign being preferred to the sons of the daughters or sisters 
of the sovereign among the sovereign's grandsons and nephews. 

7 By 31 Hen. VIII. c. 10, the king's vicegerent "for good and 
due ministration of justice in all causes and cases touching the 
ecclesiastical jurisdiction " is placed immediately before the arch- 
bishop of Canterbury. The office of vicegerent or vicar-general was 
then held by Thomas, Lord Cromwell, afterwards earl of Essex, 
together with that of lord privy seal, and it was never conferred on 
any other person. By the Act of Union with Ireland the archbishops 
of Ireland had place next to the archbishops of England, and if 
consecrated before and not after the disestablishment of the Church 
in Ireland they retain this position under the Irish Church Act of 
1869. At the coronation of William IV. the lord chancellor of 
Ireland walked next after the lord chancellor of Great Britain and 
before the lord president of the council and lord privy seal. In 
Ireland, if he is a peer he has precedence between the archbishops 
of Armagh and Dublin, and if he is not a peer^after the archbishop 
of Dublin. But, except in the House of Lords, the precedence of 
the lord chancellor of Great Britain or the lord keeper of the great 
seal is the same whether he is a peer or a commoner. The lord 
keeper has the same precedence as the lord chancellor under 5 Eliz. 
c. 18. But the last appointment to the lord keepership was that 
of Sir Robert Henley, afterwards Lord Henley, lord chancellor, and 
earl of Northington, in 1757, and the office is not likely to be revived.

1 The lord president of the council and the lord privy seal, if they 
are peers, are placed by 31 Hen. VIII. c. 10 before all dukes except 
dukes related to the sovereign in one or other of the degrees of 
consanguinity specified in the act. And, since the holders of these 
offices nave been and are always peers, their proper precedence if 
they arc commoners has never been determined. 

1 It is provided by 31 Hen. VIII. c. 10 that " the Great Chamber- 
lain, the Constable, the Marshal, the Lord Admiral, the Grand Master 
or Lord Steward, and the King's Chamberlain shall sit and be placed 
after the Lord Privy Seal in manner and form following: that is to 
say, every one of them shall sit and be placed above all other person- 
ages being of the same estates or degrees that they shall happen to 
be of, that is to say the Great Chamberlain first, the Constable next, 
the Marshal third, the Lord Admiral the fourth, the Grand Master 
or Lord Steward the fifth, and the King's Chamberlain the sixth." 
The office of lord high steward of England, then under attainder, is 
not mentioned in the act for the placing of the Lords, " because it 
was intended," Lord Chief Justice Coke says, " that when the use 
of him should be necessary he should not endure longer than hacvice " 
(Inst. iv. 77). But it may be noted that, when his office is called 
out of abeyance for coronations or trials by the House of Lords, the 
lord high steward is the greatest of all the great officers of state in 
England. The office^ of lord great chamberlain of England is 
hereditary in the coheirs of the last duke of Ancaster, who inherited 
it from the De Veres, earls of Oxford, in whose line it had descended 
from the reign of Henry J. The office of lord high constable of 
England, also under attainder, is called out of abeyance for and 
pending coronations only. The office of earl marshal is hereditary 
in the Howards, dukes of Norfolk, premier dukes and, as earls of 
Arundel, premier earls of England, under a grant in special tail male 
from Charles II. in 1672. The office of lord high admiral, like the 
office of lord high treasurer, is practically extinct as a dignity. Since 
the reign of Queen Anne there has been only one lord high admiral, 
namely, William, duke of Clarence, afterwards William IV., for a 
few months in the Canning administration of 1827. The lord steward 
and the lord chamberlain of the household are always peers, and 
have seldom been under the degree of earls. We may here remark 
that both the Scottish and Irish Acts of Union make no reference 
to the precedence of the great officers of state of Scotland and Ireland. 
Not to mention the prince of Wales, who is by birth steward of Scot- 
land, the earl of Shrewsbury is hereditary great seneschal of Ireland; 
the duke of Argyll is hereditary master of the household; the earl 
of Errol is hereditary lord high constable of Scotland; but what 
places they are entitled to in the scale of general precedence is alto- 
gether doubtful and uncertain. In Ireland the great seneschal 
ranks after the lord chancellor if he is a commoner, and after the 
archbishop of Dublin if the lord chancellor is a peer, and in both 
cases before dukes (" Order of precedence," Dublin Gazette, June 3, 
1843). Again, on George IV.'s visit to Edinburgh in 1821, the lord 
high constable had place as the first subject in Scotland immediately 
after the members of the royal family. At every coronation from 
that of George 111. to that of Queen Victoria, the lord high constable 
of Scotland has been placed next to the earl marshal of England, 
and, although no rank has been assigned on these occasions to the 
hereditary great seneschal of Ireland, the lord high constable of 
Ireland appointed for the ceremony has been at all or most of them 
placed^ next to the lord high constable of Scotland. It is worthy 
of notice, however, that Sir George Mackenzie, writing when lord 
advocate of Scotland in the reign of Charles II., says that "the 
Constable and MarischaUake not place as Officers of the Crown but 
according to their creation as Earls," and he moreover expresses 
the opinion that " it seems very strange that these who ride upon 
the King's right and left hand when he returns from his Parliaments 
and who guard the Parliament itself, and .the Honours, should have 
no precedency by their offices " (Observations, &c., p. 25, in Guillim's 
Display of Heraldry, p. 461 seq.; but see also Wood-Douglas, Peerage 
of Scotland, i. 557). 

* Both Sir Charles Young and Sir Bernard Burke place " Dukes of 
the Blood Royal " before dukes, their eldest sons before marquesses, 
and their younger sons before marquesses' eldest sons. In the 
" Ancient Tables of Precedence," which we have already cited, dukes 
of the bloody royal are always ranked before other dukes, and in most 
of them their eldest sons and in some of them their younger sons are 
placed in a corresponding order of precedence. But in this connexion 
the words of the act for the placing of the Lords are perfectly plain 
and unambiguous: " All Dukes not aforementioned, * i.e. all except 
only such as shall happen to be the king's son, the king's brother, 
the king's uncle, the king's nephew, or the king's brother s or sister's 
son, " Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts and Barons, not having any of 
the offices aforesaid, shall sit and be placed after their ancienty as 



sons; (30) bishops; (31) barons; 6 (32) speaker of the House of 
Commons; (33) commissioners of the great seal; 5 (34) treasurer 
of the household; (35) comptroller of the household; (36) master 
of the horse; (37) vice-chamberlain of the household; (38) 
secretaries of state; 7 (39) viscounts' eldest sons; (40) earls' 
younger sons; (41) barons' eldest sons; (42) knights of the 
Garter; 8 (43) privy councillors; 9 (44) chancellor of the exchequer; 
(45) chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; (46) lord chief 
it hath been accustomed." As Lord Chief Justice Coke and Mr 
Justice Blackstone observe, the decrees of consanguinity with the 
sovereign to which precedence is given by 31 Hen. VIII. c. 10 arc 
the same as those within which it was made nigh treason by 28 Hen. 
VIII. c. 18 for any man to contract marriage without the consent 
of the king. Queen Victoria, by letters patent under the great seal 
in 1865, ordained that, " besides the children of Sovereigns of these 
realms, the children of the sons of any of the Sovereigns of Great 
Britain and Ireland shall have and at all times hold and enjoy the 
style or attribute of ' Royal Highness' with their titular dignity 
of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names, 
or with their other titles of honour." But, notwithstanding this, 
their rank and place are still governed by the act for the placing of 
the Lords. The duke of Cumberland has no precedence as a cousin 
of the king, being the grandson of a son of George III. and would 
not be a Royal Highness " at all if his father had not been, like 
his grandfather, king of Hanover. In Garter* s Roll of Die Lords 
Spiritual and Temporal, the official list of the House of Lords, the 
duke of Cumberland is entered in the precedence of his dukedom 
after the duke of Northumberland. Under the combined operation 
of the act for the placing of the Lords and the Acts of Union with 
Scotland (art. 23) and with Ireland (art. 4), peers of the same degrees, 
as dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts ana barons, severally, have 
precedence according to priority in the creation of their respective 
peerages. But peerages of England created before 1707 precede 
peerages of Scotland created before 1707, peerages of Great Britain 
created between 1707 and 1801 precede peerages of Ireland created 
before 1801, and peerages of Ireland created before 1801 precede 
peerages of the United Kingdom and of Ireland created after 1801, 
which take precedence in common. The relative precedence of the 
members of the House of Lords, including the representative peers 
of Scotland and Ireland, is officially set forth in Uarter's roll, which 
is prepared by the Garter king of arms at the commencement of each 
session of parliament, that of the Scottish peers generally in the 
Union Roll, and that of the Irish peers generally in Ulster s Roll, a 
record which is under the charge of and is periodically corrected 
by the Ulster king of arms. The Union Roll is founded on the 
44 Decreet of Ranking "pronounced and promulgated by a royal 
commission in 1606, which, in the words of an eminent authority 
in such matters, " was adopted at once as the roll of the peers in 
Parliament, convention and all public meetings, and continued to 
be called uninterruptedly with such alterations upon it as judgments 
of the Court of Session upon appeal in modification of the precedency 
of certain peers rendered necessary, with the omission of such 
dignities as became extinct and with the addition from time to 
time of newly created peerages — down to the last sitting of the 
Scottish Parliament on the 1st of May 1707 " (The Earldom of Mar, 
&c.,by the earl of Crawford (25th) and Balcarres (8th), 11. 16). 

4 Eldest sons of peers of any given degree are of the same rank as, 
but are to be placed immediately after, peers of the first degree under 
that of their fathers; and the younger sons of peers of any given 
degree are of the same rank, but are to be placed after peers of the 
second degree and the eldest sons of peers of the first degree under 
that of their fathers. 

* Secretaries of state, if they are barons, precede all other barons 
under 31 Hen. VIII. c. 10. But if they are of any higher degree their 
rank is not influenced by their official position. 

6 Under 1 Will, and Mary, c. 21, being the only commissioners 
for the execution of any office who have precedence assigned to 
them. 

7 The officers of the household who, under Henry VIIL's warrant 
of 1540, precede the secretaries of state have been for a long time 
always peers or the sons of peers, with personal rank higher, and 
usually far higher, than their official rank. The practical result is, 
seeing also that the great seal is only very rarely indeed in commission, 
that the secretaries of state, when they are commoners whose personal 
precedence is below a baron's, have official precedence immediately 
after the speaker of the House of Commons. The principal secretaries, 
for so they are all designated, are officially equal to one another in 
dignity, and arc placed among themselves according to seniority 
of appointment. 

8 During more than two centuries only one commoner has been 
indebted tor his precedence to his election into the order, and that 
was Sir Robert Walpole, the minister, who at the coronation of 
George II. in 1727 was placed as a knight of the Garter immediately 
before privy councillors. The proper precedence of both knights of 
the Thistle and knights of St Patrick is undecided.

of England, the master of the rolls, and the lords justices of appael

1 The lords justices of appeal have precedence among themselves 
according to seniority of appointment. Until recently they were 
preceded by the lord chief justice of the common pleas and the lord 
chief baron of the exchequer (divisions of the High Court of Justice). 
But under existing arrangements these offices have fallen into abey- 
ance, although they have not been formally "abolished. The vice- 
chancellors used to follow the lords justices of appeal; but, in spite 
of the fact that there is still one vice-chancellor remaining, the office 
of vice-chancellor is extinct and will altogether disappear on his 
decease. In Ireland all these offices are in existence, but they have 
no precedence allotted to them in England; as the judges holding 
them are invariably privy councillors, however, they are ranked 
accordingly. And it is the same with regard to the lord justice- 
general and the lord justice-clerk in Scotland. 

1 The judges of all the divisions of the High Court of Justice are 
ranked together according to seniority of appointment. Neither the 
senators of the College of Justice in Scotland nor the judges of the 
various divisions of the High Court in Ireland have any precedence 
in England. The precedence of the Scottish judges among them- 
selves is settled by a royal warrant of Nisbet in his System of Heraldry. 
The precedence of the Irish judges among themselves is the same 
as the precedence of the English judges among themselves used to 
be before the offices of chief justice of the common pleas and chief 
baron of the exchequer were suspended. 

3 By warrants of the 30th of March 1898, although lords of 
appeal rank with hereditary barons in order of creation, their sons 
stand in a class by themselves. 

4 It is a question whether baronets ought or ought not to have 
precedence, like peers, according as they are of England, Scotland, 
Great Britain, Ireland or the United. Kingdom. Baronets are 
not referred to in either the Scottish or the Irish Act of Union; 
and Sir Bernard Burke contends that, since the Acts of Union are 
silent with regard to them, they are still entitled to whatever pre- 
cedence was originally conferred on them. He therefore places 
the whole body of the baronets together in the order merely of the 
dates of their several creations, and in this he appears to us to have 
both law and reason on his side. 

6 These knights consist of grand crosses of the first, grand 
commanders of the second, and grand crosses of the third order, 
and have precedence in their respective orders according to seniority 
of creation. By the statutes of the order of the Bath, as revised 
in 1847, it is ordained that the knights grand crosses are to be placed 
" next to and immediately after baronets," thus superseding 
knights bannerets not created by the sovereign in person. 

8 Knights commanders of all three orders are placed in each 
order according to seniority of creation. 

7 Knights bachelors are ranked together according to seniority 
of creation, whether they are made by the sovereign or the lord 
lieutenant of Ireland. 

8 Royal x. Warrant of 1884. 

9 The sons of all persons, when any specified rank is assigned to 
them, are placed in the precedence of their fathers. Eldest sons 
of the younger sons of peers were ranked before the eldest sons of 
knights by order of the earl marshal, the 18th of March 1615, and 
before the eldest sons of baronets by order of the earl marshal, 
the 6th of April 1677. But no precedence has been given to the 
younger sons of the younger sons of peers, although precedence 
is given to the younger as well as the eldest sons of baronets and 
knights by James I. s decree of 1616. Moreover, no precedence 
has been given to either the eldest or the younger sons of the eldest 
sons of peers. But in practice this omission is generally disre- 
garded, and the children of the eldest sons of dukes, marquesses 
and* earls, at all events, are accorded the same rank and titles 
which they would have if their fathers were actual instead of quasi 
peers of the degree next under that of their grandfathers. Sir 
Charles Young says that " by decision (Chap. Coll. Arms of 1680) if 
the eldest son of an earl died in his father's lifetime leaving a son and 
heir, such son and heir during the life of the earl his grandfather is

wives of the sovereign's brothers; (9) aunts of the sovereign; 
(10) wives of the sovereign's uncles; (11) nieces of the sovereign; 

entitled to the same place and precedence as was due to his father: so 
had the father been summoned to parliament as the eldest son of a 
peer the grandson would succeed to the dignity even during the 
grandfather's lifetime " (Order of Precedence , p. 27). And, ol course, 
what applies to the grandson and heir of an earl applies equally 
to the grandsons and heirs of dukes and marquesses. But the 
grandsons and heirs of viscounts and barons are differently situated, 
and have neither honorary additions to their names nor any ascer- 
tained place and precedence even by the etiquette of society. 

10 t Companions are members of the third class of the first three 
orders and the only members of the fourth order, except the 
sovereign and the grand master. Sir Charles Young and Sir Bernard 
Burke concur in placing the companions of these orders before the 
eldest sons of the younger sons of peers, on the ground that under 
their statutes they are entitled to precede " all Esquires of the 
Realm." But the sons of peers themselves — the eldest as well 
as the younger — are merely esquires, and are ranked before, and 
not among, other esquires because they have a particular preced- 
ence of their own assigned to them. Similarly the eldest sons 
of the younger sons of peers and the eldest sons of baronets and of 
knights who are also esquires, and likewise the younger sons of 
baronets and of knights who are not esquires, have a particular 
precedence of their own assigned to them. All of them are placed 
before esquires as a specific grade in the scale of general precedence, 
and it seems clear enough that it is before esquires, considered as 
a specific grade, that the companions of the orders ought to be placed 
and not before any other persons who, whether they are or are not 
esquires, have a definite and settled rank which is superior to that 
specific grade in the scale of general precedence. 

11 It appears to be admitted on all hands that the following 
persons are esquires and ought to be so described in all legal docu- 
ments and processes: first, the eldest sons of peers in the lifetime 
of their fathers, and the younger sons of peers both in and after 
the lifetime of their fathers; secondly, the eldest sons of the younger 
sons of peers and their eldest sons m perpetual succession, and the 
eldest sons of baronets and knights; thirdly, esquires created 
with or without the grant of armorial bearings by the sovereign; 
fourthly, justices of the peace, barristers-at-law and mayors of 
corporations; and fifthly, those who are styled esquires in patents, 
commissions or appointments to offices under the Crown in the 
state, the household, the army or navy and elsewhere. Sir Bernard 
Burke accords precedence to serjeants-at-law and masters in lunacy, 
not only before esquires as such, but also before the companions 
of the orders of knighthood. It is, however, enough to observe 
with regard to the first, since no more of them are to be created, 
that, in spite of the extravagant pretensions which have been fre- 
quently urged by them and on their behalf, " they have not in the 
general scale," as Sir Charles Young says, " any precedence, and 
when under the degree of a Knight rank only as Esquires "; and 
with regard to the second, that the statute 8 & 9 Vict. c. 100, on 
which the Ulster king of arms bases their claims, simply provides 
that they " shall take the same rank and precedence as the masters 
in ordinary of the High Court of Chancery," who are now extinct, 
" apparently," to recur to Sir Charles Young, " assuming the rank 
of the masters without defining it." " The masters, however," 
he adds, " as such have not a settled place in the order of general 
precedency emanating from any authority by statute or otherwise " 
(Order of Precedence, p. 71). Sir William Blackstone says that 
before esquires " the Heralds rank all Colonels, Serjeants-at-Law 
and Doctors in the three learned professions " (Commentaries, 
vol. i. ch. 12). But the only foundation for this statement seems to be 
a passage in Guillim, which is obviously without any authority. 

12 The heralds and lawyers are agreed that gentlemen are those 
who, by inheritance or grant from the Crown, are entitled to bear 
coat armour (see Coke, Inst. iv. ch. 77; Blackstone, Comm. i. ch. 12; 
Selden, Titles of Honor, pt. ii. ch. 8; Guillim, Display of Heraldry, 
pt. ii. ch. 26). v 

13 The queen-consort is the second personage in the realm, and 
has precedence of the queen-dowager. But the husband of a reign- 
ing queen has no rank or place except such as is specially accorded 
to him by the sovereign.

A special table of precedence in Scotland is regulated by a 
royal warrant dated the 16th of March 1905, and a special 
table of precedence in Ireland was set forth by authority of 
the Lord Lieutenant (Jan. 2, 1895). Both contain errors and 
will probably be revised. 

Attention to the foregoing tables will show that general 
precedence is of different kinds as well as of several degrees. 
It is first either personal or official, and secondly either substan- 
tive or derivative. Personal precedence belongs to the royal 

1 There is no act of parliament or ordinance of the Crown regu- 
lating the precedence of the female members of the royal family. 
But the above is the gradation which appears to have become 
established among them, and follows the analogy supplied by the 
act for the placing of the lords in the case of their husbands and 
brothers. 

2 Peeresses in their own right and peeresses by marriage are 
ranked together, the first in their own precedence and the second 
in the precedence of their husbands. 

3 Among the daughters of peers there is no distinction between 
the eldest and the younger as there is among the sons of peers. 
Their precedence is immediately after the wives of their eldest 
brothers, and several degrees above the wives of their younger 
brothers. They are placed among themselves in the precedence 
of their fathers. But the daughter of the premier duke or baron 
ranks after the wife of the eldest son of the junior duke or baron. 

4 Maids of honour to the queen are the only women who have 
any official precedence. They have the style or title of honour- 
able, and are placed immediately after barons' daughters by Sir 
Bernard Burke, the rank which is accorded to them by the eti- 
quette of society. But Sir Charles Young does not assign any 
precedence to them, and we do not know on what authority the 
Ulster king of arms does so, although he is by no means singular 
in the course he has taken. 

6 The wives of baronets and knights, the wives of the eldest 
sons and the daughters of the younger sons of peers, and the wives of 
the sons and the daughters of baronets and knights are all placed 
severally in the precedence of their respective husbands, husbands' 
fathers and fathers. 

6 H Esquire " and " gentleman " are not names of " dignity " 
but names of " worship," and esquires and gentlemen do not, in 
strictness, convey or transmit any precedence to their wives or 
ch ]l[]ren (see Coke, Inst, ii., " Of Additions," p. 667). 

And generosus and generosa are good additions: and if a 
gentlewoman be named Spinster in any original writ, i.e. appeal 
or indictment, she may abate and quash the same, for she hath 
as good right to that addition as Baroness, Viscountess, Marchioness 
or Duchess have to theirs " (Coke, Inst, ii., " Of Additions," p. 668). 



family, the peerage and certain specified classes of the com- 
monalty. Official precedence belongs to such of the dignitaries 
of the Church and such of the ministers of state and the household 
as have had rank and place accorded to them by parliament or 
the Crown, to the speaker of the House of Commons and to the 
members of the privy council and the judicature. Substantive 
precedence, which may be either personal or official, belongs to 
all those whose rank and place arc enjoyed by them indepen- 
dently of their connexion with anybody else, as by the arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, the lord high chancellor or the lord great 
chamberlain, peers and peeresses, baronets, knights and some 
esquires. Derivative precedence, which can only be personal, 
belongs to all those whose rank and place are determined by 
their consanguinity with or affinity to somebody else, as the 
lineal and collateral relations of the sovereign, the sons, daugh- 
ters and daughters-in-law of peers and peeresses in their own 
right, and the wives, sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of 
baronets, knights and some esquires. It is to be observed, 
however, that the precedence of the sovereign is at once official 
and personal, and that the precedence of peeresses by marriage 
is at once derivative and substantive. In the case of the sover- 
eign it is his or her actual tenure of the office of king or queen 
which regulates the rank and place of the various members of 
the royal family, and in the case of peeresses by marriage, 
although their rank and place are derivative in origin, yet they 
are substantive in continuance, since during coverture and widow- 
hood peeresses by marriage are as much peeresses as peeresses in 
their own right, and their legal and political status is precisely 
the same as if they had acquired it by creation or inheritance. 

Bearing the above definitions and explanations in mind, the 
following canons or rules may be found practically useful: — 

1. Anybody who is entitled to both personal and official 
precedence is to be placed according to that which implies the 
higher rank. If, for example, a baron and a baronet are both 
privy councillors, the precedence of the first is that of a baron 
and the precedence of the second is that of a privy councillor. 
And similarly, except as hereafter stated, with respect to the 
holders of two or more personal or two or more official 
dignities. 

2. Save in the case of the sovereign, official rank can never 
supply the foundation for derivative rank. Hence the official 
precedence of a husband or father affords no indication of the 
personal precedence of his wife or children. The wives and 
children, for example, of the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord 
high chancellor or the speaker of the House of Commons do 
not participate in their official rank but only in their personal 
rank, whatever it may be. 

3. Among subjects men alone can convey derivative rank, 
except in the case of the daughters and sisters of the sovereign, 
or of peeresses in their own right. But no man can acquire any 
rank or place by marriage. The sons-in-law or brothers-in-law 
of the sovereign and the husbands of peeresses in their own right 
have as such no precedence whatever. And the daughter and 
heiress of the premier duke of England, unless she happens to be 
also a peeress in her own right, does not transmit any rank or 
place to her children. 

4. Within the limits of the peerage derivative rank is as a 
rule always merged in personal, as distinguished from official, 
substantive rank. If, for example, the younger son of a duke is 
created a baron or inherits a barony, his precedence ceases to be 
that of a duke's younger son and becomes that of a baron. 
But where the eldest son of a duke, a marquess or an earl is 
summoned to the House of Lords in a barony of his father's, 
or succeeds as or is created a baron, he is still, as before, " com- 
monly called " by some superior title of peerage, as marquess, 
earl or viscount, and retains his derivative precedence on all 
occasions, except in parliament or at ceremonies which he attends 
in his character as a peer. The younger sons of all peers, 
however, who are created or who inherit peerages — which they 
often do under special limitations — are everywhere placed 
according to their substantive rank, no matter how inferior it 
may be to their derivative rank. But if the son of a duke or a 



272 



PRECEDENCE 



marquess, whether eldest or younger, or the eldest son of an earl 
is consecrated a bishop his derivative rank is not merged in his 
substantive rank, because it is official, and his derivative and 
personal rank implies the higher precedence. Again, the daugh- 
ters of dukes, marquesses and earls who become peeresses by 
marriage or creation, or who inherit as peeresses, are placed 
according to their substantive and not according to their deriva- 
tive rank, although they may thereby be assigned a far lower 
precedence than that to which their birth entitles them. 

5. The widows of peers and baronets have precedence imme- 
diately before the wives or widows of the next successors in their 
husbands' dignities. But the sons and daughters of peers and 
baronets have precedence immediately before the sons and 
daughters of the holders of the dignities to whom their fathers 
succeeded. The reason of this is that the first are senior in the 
dignities and the second are nearer in the line of succession to 
them. 

6. The widows of peers who marry again either share the 
precedence of their second husbands or resume the precedence 
bejonging to them independently of their marriage with their 
first husbands. Thus, if the daughter of a duke or an esquire 
marries first an earl and secondly a baron, although she remains 
a peeress, she is placed as a baroness instead of a countess. But 
if either of them should marry a commoner as her second 
husband, whatever may be his rank or degree, she ceases to be a 
peeress. While, however, the duke's daughter, if her second 
husband were not the eldest son of a duke, would resume her 
precedence as the daughter of a duke, the esquire's daughter 
would share the precedence of her second husband, whether he 
were a peer's son, a baronet, a knight or an esquire. The widows 
of peers have long kept their former rank in society, but they 
have no such right unless by permission of the sovereign, which 
permission has on several recent occasions been refused. 

7. The widows of the eldest and younger sons of dukes and 
marquesses and of the eldest sons of earls, and also the widows of 
baronets and knights who marry again, are permitted by the 
etiquette of society to keep the titles and rank acquired by their 
first marriage if their second marriage is with a commoner 
whose precedence is considerably lower. But the widows of the 
younger sons of earls "and of the eldest and younger sons of 
viscounts and barons, although their precedence is higher 
than that of the widows of baronets and knights, are not 
allowed to retain it, under any circumstances, after a second 
marriage. 

8. Marriage does not affect the precedence of peeresses in 
their own right unless their husbands are peers whose peerages 
are of a higher degree, or, being of the same degree, are of more 
ancient creation than their own. If, for example, a baroness in 
her own right marries a viscount she is placed and described as a 
viscountess, or if she marries a baron whose barony is older than 
hers she is placed in his precedence and described by his title. 
But if she marries a baron whose barony is junior to hers she 
keeps her own precedence and title. 

9. The daughters of peers, of sons of peers, baronets and 
knights retain after marriage the precedence they derive from 
their fathers, unless they marry peers of any rank or commoners 
of higher rank than their own. Hence, for example, the daughter 
of a duke who marries the eldest son of a marquess is placed as 
a duke's daughter, not as the wife of a marquess's eldest son, 
and the daughter of a baronet who marries the younger son of a 
knight is placed as a baronet's daughter and not as the wife of a 
knight's younger son. 

10. What are termed " titles of courtesy " are borne by all the 
sons and daughters of peers and peeresses in their own right, who 
in this connexion stand on exactly the same footing. The 
eldest sons of dukeSj marquesses and earls are designated by the 
names of one or other of the inferior peerages of their fathers, 
usually a marquessate or an earldom in the first, an earldom or a 
viscounty in the second and a viscounty or barony in the third 
case. The rule applicable in former times, still adhered to by 
the older English dignities, was that a duke's eldest son was 
styled earl, the son of a marquess, viscount, the son of an earl, 



baron. No such rule obtained in Scotland. But, whatever it 
may be, it is altogether without effect on the rank and place of 
the bearer, which are those belonging to him as the eldest son of 
his father. The younger sons of dukes and marquesses are 
styled " lords," followed by both their Christian names and 
surnames. The younger sons of earls and both the eldest and 
the younger sons of viscounts and barons are described as 
" honourable" before both their Christian names and surnames. 
The daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls are styled " ladies " 
before both their Christian names and surnames. The daughters 
of viscounts and barons are described as "honourable" before 
both their Christian names and surnames. If the eldest son of a 
marquess or an earl marries a woman of rank equal or inferior 
to his own, she takes his title and precedence; but if she is of 
superior rank she retains, with her own precedence, the prefix 
" lady " before her Christian name followed by the name of 
her husband's title of courtesy. Again, if the younger son of a 
'duke or a marquess marries a woman of rank equal or inferior 
to his own, she is called " lady," with his Christian and sur- 
name following, and is placed in his precedence, but, if she is 
of superior rank, she retains, with her own precedence, the 
prefix " lady " before her Christian name and his surname. If the 
daughter of a duke, a marquess or an earl marries the younger 
son of an earl, the eldest or younger son of a viscount or baron, a 
baronet, a knight or an esquire, &c, she retains, with her own 
precedence, the prefix " lady " before her Christian name and 
her husband's surname. If the daughter of a viscount marries 
the younger son of an earl or anybody of inferior rank to 
him, or the daughter of a baron marries the younger son of a 
viscount or anybody of inferior rank to him, she retains her own 
precedence with the prefix " honourable " before the addition 
" Mrs v and his surname or Christian name and surname. But, 
if her husband is a baronet or a knight, she is called the Honour- 
able Lady Smith or the Honourable Lady Jones, as the case may 
be. The wives of the younger sons of earls and of the eldest and 
younger sons of viscounts and barons, if they are of inferior 
rank to their husbands, take their precedence and are described 
as the Honourable Mrs, with the surnames or Christian names 
and surnames of their husbands following. The judges were 
placed by James I. before the younger sons of viscounts and 
barons and accorded the title of " honourable " (g.v.). But in 
this addition their wives do not participate, since it is merely an 
official distinction. - 

It is manifest on even a cursory examination of the tables 
we have given that, although they embody the only scheme of 
general precedence, whether for men or for women, which is 
authoritatively sanctioned or recognized, they are in many 
respects very imperfectly fitted to meet the circumstances and 
requirements of the present day. 1 In both of them the limits 
prescribed to the royal family are pedantically and inconveni- 
ently narrow, and stand out in striking contrast to the wide and 
ample bounds through which the operation of the Royal Marriage 
Act (12 Geo. III. c. 11) extends the disabilities but not the 
privileges of the sovereign's kindred. Otherwise the scale ot 
general precedence for women compares favourably enough with 

1 " There are no doubt certain public ceremonials of State, such 
as Coronations, Royal Public Funerals and Processions of the 
Sovereign to Parliament, &c, wherein various public functionaries 
walk and have for the occasion certain places assigned to them, 
but which they may not at all times find the same, as it by no 
means follows that they are always entitled to the same place for 
Having been -there once: there is to a certain extent a precedent 
furnished thereby, and in some cases the uniformity of precedence 
in regard to one class over another has in such cases become estab- 
lished. This applies, for instance, to the places of the Gentlemen 
of the^ Privy Chamber, Law Officers of the Crown and Masters 
and Six Clerks in Chancery, who have no definite or fixed place 
in the tables of precedency regulating the general orders of society, 
though in reference to State ceremonials they have certain places 
assigned in the order of procession in right of their offices, which, 
however, give them no general rank. Upon such occasions, never- 
theless, the legal rank and precedence which they hold in the Courts 
of Law is observed, and so far establishes among themselves, and 
in respect to their several classes, their precedency " (Sir Charles 
Young, Order of Precedence, &c, pp. 59-61). 



PRECEDENCE

the scale of general precedence for men. If, indeed, it includes 
the queen's maids of honour and the wives of the companions 
of the knightly orders, there certainly does not seems to be any 
good reason why it should omit the mistress of the robes and the 
ladies of the bedchamber, or the ladies of the royal order of 
Victoria and Albert and the imperial order of the Crown of India. 
But these are trifling matters in themselves, and concern only 
a minute fraction of the community. The scale of general 
precedence for men is now in substantially the same condition 
as that in which it has been for between two and three centuries, 
and the political, to say nothing of the social, arrangements to 
which it was framed to apply have in the interval undergone an 
almost complete transformation. The consequence is that a 
good deal of it has come down to us in the shape of a survival, 
and has ceased to be of any practical use for the purpose it was 
originally designed to effect. While it comprises several official 
and personal dignities which are virtually obsolete and extin- 
guished, it entirely omits the great majority of the members of 
Government in its existing form, and whole sections of society 
on a less exalted level, to whom it is universally felt that some 
rank and place at all events are both in public and in private 
justly due. And, when it does confess the presence of any of 
the sovereign's principal ministers, it commonly places them in 
positions which are out of all keeping with their actual eminence 
and importance. It ranks the lord president of the council 
and the lord privy seal before dukes, while it places the chan- 
cellor of the exchequer after the younger sons of earls and the 
eldest sons of barons, and the secretaries of state after the master 
of the horse and the vice-chamberlain of the household. The 
lord chancellor still has precedence as the first of the great 
officers of state, which was allotted to him not as what he is, 
the head of the judicature, but as what he once was, the prime 
minister of the sovereign", and the lord chief justice, who is next 
to him in regular judicial rank, as presiding over the common 
law courts, as he presides over the courts of equity, is placed 
after the chancellors of the exchequer and of the duchy of 
Lancaster, who still have the precedence which was allotted to 
them not as ministers, which they are, but as judges, which they 
are no longer. Neither the lord-lieutenant of Ireland, the 
viceroy of India, nor the governor-general of Canada has any 
rank or place at St Jameses, where, as well as at Westminster, 
the lord steward or the lord chamberlain of the household is a 
much greater and more splendid personage. Again, in the scale 
of general precedence there are no clergymen except bishops, no 
lawyers except judges, and no officers of either the army or the 
navy from field marshals and admirals of the fleet downwards. 
Nor, of course, are any colonial governors or lieutenant-governors 
entered on it. It contains no mention of under-secretaries of 
state, chairmen or commissioners of administrative boards, 
comptrollers or secretaries of government departments, lord- 
lieutenants or sheriffs of counties, deputy lieutenants or justices 
of the peace, members of the House of Commons or graduates 
of the universities. It is true that among some of these classes 
definite systems of subordination are established by either 
authority or usage, which are carefully observed and enforced 
in the particular areas and spheres to which they have reference. 
But we have seldom any means of determining the relative 
value of a given term in one series as compared with a given term 
in another series, or of connecting the different steps in the scales 
of local, professional or academical precedence with the different 
steps in the scale of general precedence, to which such scales of 
special precedence ought to be contributory and supplementary. 
We know, for example, that major-generals and rear-admirals are 
of equal rank, that with them are placed commissaries-general 
and inspectors-general of hospitals and fleets, that in India along 
with civilians of thirty-one years' standing they immediately 
follow the vice-chancellors of the Indian universities, and that 
in relation to the consular service they immediately precede 
agents-general and consuls-general. But there is nothing to 
aid us in determining whether in England they should be ranked 
with, before or after deans, king's counsel or doctors in divinity, 
who are as destitute as they are themselves of any recognized 



general precedence, and who, as matters now stand, would 
certainly have to give place to the younger sons of baronets and 
knights and the companions of the knightly orders. 

No foreigner has any legal precedence in Great Britain, 1 
but it is suggested that it being proper courtesy to accord to 
guests the precedence due to the rank they bear in their own 
countries, they should rank in society with and immediately 
before those of the relative rank in England. It should, how- 
ever, be remembered that the younger sons of counts and 
other nobles bear the title of count with the addition of the 
Christian name, and they should be ranked with younger sons 
of British carls, &c, whatever title they bear. The eldest son 
of a duke for example is sometimes called prince, but the place 
accorded to him by the above rule would be next after a British 
marquess. Some persons of authority consider, however, that 
a foreigner should be given precedence over every native 
whatever the rank may be. 

It has now become usual to recognize ecclesiastical rank 
derived from the pope, even when held by subjects of the king. 
Cardinals, therefore, rank by international usage above arch- 
bishops, as princes of the blood royal, and in Ireland, Roman 
Catholic and Protestant bishops rank as such by authority of 
the warrants there in force. 

An order respecting precedence was sent by the secretary of 
state for the colonies to the governor-general of Canada (July 24, 
1868). Precedence in India is regulated by a Royal Warrant 
dated the 6th of May 187 1, a copy of which is subjoined.

PRECENTOR (Late Lat. praecenior, from praecinere, to sing 
before, lead in singing), the title of the principal director of the 
singing or musical portions of the service in a cathedral or 
cathedral church. In the English Church in cathedrals of the 
" Old Foundation " the precentor is a member of the cathedral 
chapter and officially ranks next to the dean. His musical 
duties are usually performed by the " succentor," one of the 
vicars choral. In cathedrals of the " New Foundation " the 
" precentor " is not a member of the chapter, but is one of the 
minor canons. 

PRECEPT (Lat. praeceptum, a rule, from praecipere, literally 
to take beforehand, to give rules, instructions or orders), a com- 
mand or rule, especially one with regard to conduct or action, a 
moral rule or injunction, a maxim. Apart from this general 
use, the word was used, in law, of many orders in writing issuing 
from a court or other legal authority; it is now chiefly used of an 
order demanding the payment of money under a rate by poor 
law or other local authorities (see Rate). The Latin form 
praecipe, i.e. enjoin, command, is used of the note of instructions 
delivered by a plaintiff or his solicitor to be filed by the officer 
of the court, giving the names of the plaintiff and defendant, 
the nature of the writ, &c. For the obsolete writ of praecipe 
quod reddat see Writ. 

PRECEPTOR, a teacher or instructor, the classical meaning 
of the Latin praeceptor, from praecipere, literally to take in 
advance, hence to give rules or " precepts," advise, teach. As 
an educational term in English the word is familiar through the 
College of Preceptors, a chartered society chiefly composed of 
private teachers; it was incorporated in 1849 and was one of the 
first professional bodies to institute regular courses of pedagogic 
lectures and to award after examination the titles of licentiate 
and associate to teachers. It also holds examinations for pupils. 
In post-classical Latin praeceptor meant a commander, praecipere, 
to order, enjoin, and the term was adopted by the Knights 
Templars for the heads of the provincial communities of knights 
established on their estates. These communities and the estates 
themselves were known as " preceptories," and answered to the 
" commanderies " of the Hospitallers. 

PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES, in astronomy, the term 
assigned to the progressive motion of the equinox, because it 
takes place in a direction from east towards west, opposite to 
that in which planets move, and in which longitudes are 
measured. The equinox being defined as the point of intersec- 
tion of the equator and ecliptic, its motion arises from the fact 
that both of these great circles are in continuous though slow 
motion. The motion of the ecliptic is due to the action of the 
planets on the earth, which produces a slow progressive change 
in the position of the plane of the earth's orbit, and therefore of 
the ecliptic. This motion takes place round a diameter of 
the celestial sphere as an axis or nodal line, which intersects the 
sphere in two points, which are at present in longitudes about 
1 73 and 353°. The direction of the motion around this axis 
is such that from the limits 353 through o° to 173 , which 
includes the vernal equinox, the motion is towards the south, 
while, in the remainder of the circle, it is towards the north. 
At the present time the rate of the motion is 46.7" per century. 
In consequence of the smallness of the angle, 7 , which the axis 
of motion makes with the line of the equinoxes, its effect on the 
precession is quite small, now amounting to only 0.14" per 
annum. Owing to its cause this small part of the precession is 
called " planetary." 

The motion of the equator is due to the combined action of 
the sun and moon on the equatorial protuberance of the earth 
(see Astronomy). Owing to its cause this largest part of the 
precession is called " luni-solar." Its fundamental law is that 
the mean celestial pole at each instant (see Nutation) moves 
at right angles to the circle joining it to the pole of the ecliptic 
as that instant. Hence if the pole of the ecliptic were fixed, 
the celestial pole would revolve around it in a circle at a constant 
distance equal to the obliquity of the ecliptic. Owing, however, 
to the slow change in the position of the pole of the ecliptic, 
the motion is only approximately in a circle, and the obliquity 



PRECINCT— PREDESTINATION

varies slowly from century to century. At the present time the 
rate of motion measured on a great circle is about 20* per year; 
that is to say both the pole and the plane of the equator move 
through this angle annually. But when measured around the 
pole of the ecliptic as a centre the motion is about 2-5 times this 
or, at present, 50*37* annually. This is the present amount of 
the Iuni-solar precession which, if it remained constant, would 
carry the pole completely round in a period of 25,730 years. 
Hut the exact period varies slightly, owing to the motion of the 
pole of the ecliptic. The combined effect of the luni-solar and 
planetary precession or the total motion of the equinox is called 
the general precession. Its annual amount during our time is 
50- 2564+0-02 220* T, T being the time reckoned from 1000 in 
centuries. 

PRECINCT (from Lat. praecingere, to encircle, enclose, sur- 
round, prae and cingere, to gird), an enclosure, a space within 
the boundaries, marked by walls or fences or by an imaginary 
line, of a building or group of buildings, especially used of such 
a space belonging to a cathedral or other religious building. 
The word is frequently used, indefinitely, of the neighbourhood 
or environs of a place or building. In the United States of 
America it is applied to various minor territorial divisions or 
districts, for electoral or judicial purposes. In some of the 
states they correspond to the " township " as the principal 
subdivision of the " county." 

PRECIOUS (O. Fr. precios, mod. pricieux, Lat. pretiosus, of 
high value or price, pretium), costly or of high value, particularly 
used in political economy of those metals which are " valuable 
enough to be used as a standard of value and abundant enough 
for coinage" (The Century Dictionary). The term is thus 
practically confined to gold and silver. Platinum in theory 
may be included as it was used for coinage in Russia in 1828; 
the fluctuations in the value of the metal caused its discontinu- 
ance* in 1845 (see Gold, Silver and Money). "Precious 
stones " include those gems which are valued for ornament and 
jewelry. " Strictly speaking the only precious stones are the 
diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald, though the term is often 
extended to the opal, notwithstanding its lack of hardness, and to 
the pearl . . . strictly an animal product," G. F. Kunz, Gems and 
Precious Stones of North America (1890) (see Gem, and Lapidary 
and Gem-Cutting). A particular use of " precious "as meaning 
fastidious, over-refined, is taken from the French prtcieux, 
familiar in the appellation of Les Prtcicuses, given to the social 
and literary circle of ladies which centred round the H6tcl dc 
Rambouillet in the 17 th century (see Rambouillet; Catherine 
de Vivonne, Marquise de). 

PRECONIZATION (Late Lat. praeconizatio, from praeconizare, 
to proclaim, Lat. praeco, a public crier), a public proclamation or 
announcement. In this sense it is practically obsolete; but the 
word is still technically used of the solemn proclamation of new 
bishops, and of the sees to which they are appointed, made by the 
pope in the consistory of cardinals (see Bishop). In the English 
ecclesiastical courts " praeconize " is also still used in the sense 
of " to summon by name. " 

' PREDELLA, the Italian word for a footstool or kneeling- 
stool, hence applied to the step or platform on which an altar 
rests, and to a shelf raised above the altar at the back, a super- 
altar or gradino. The face both of the step and shelf are fre- 
quently decorated with sculpture or painting, and the term 
" predella " is frequently given to the sculpture or painting so 
used, and, further, to any painting that is a pendant to a larger 
work. 

PREDESTINATION (from Late Lat. praedestinare, to deter- 
mine beforehand; from the root sta 7 as in stare, stand), a theologi- 
cal term used in three senses: (1) God's unchangeable decision 
from eternity of all that is to be; (2) God's destination of men to 
everlasting happiness or misery; (3) God's appointment unto 
life or " election " (the appointment unto death being called 
" reprobation," and the term " foreordination " being preferred 
to " predestination " in regard to it). In the first sense the 
conception is similar to that of fate; this assumes a moral 
character as nemesis , or the inevitable penalty of transgression. 



Sophocles represents man's life as woven with a " shuttle of 
adamant " (Antigone, 622-624). Stoicism formulated a doctrine 
of providence or necessity. Epicurus denies a divine superin- 
tendence of human affairs. A powerful influence in Scandinavian 
religion was exercised by the belief in " the nornir, or Fates, 
usually thought of as three sisters." In Brahminic thought 
Karma, the consequences of action, necessitates rebirth in a 
lower or higher mode of existence, according to guilt or merit. 
With some modifications this conception is taken over by 
Buddhism. The Chinese tao, the order of heaven, which should 
be the order for earth as well, may also be compared. Accord- 
ing to Josephus (Antiq. xviii. 1, 3, 4; xiii. 5, 9) the Sadducees 
denied fate altogether, and placed good and evil wholly in man's 
choice; the Pharisees, while recognising man's freedom, laid 
emphasis on fate; the Essenes insisted on an absolute fate. 
This statement is exposed to the suspicion of attempting to 
assimilate the Jewish sects to the Greek schools. In Islam the 
orthodox theology teaches an absolute predestination, and yet 
some teachers hold men responsible for the moral character of 
their acts. The frcethinking school of the Mo'tazilites insisted 
that the righteousness of God in rewarding or punishing men for 
their actions could be vindicated only by the recognition of 
human freedom. 

The question of the relation of divine and human will has been 
the subject of two controversies in the Christian church, 
the Augustinian-Pelagian and the Calvinistic-Arminian. Pelagius 
maintained the free-will of man, and held that man's conduct, 
character, destiny are in his own hand. Grace, by enlightening, 
forgiving sin and strengthening his moral powers, helps man to 
fulfil this purpose. While grace is meant for all, men make them- 
selves worthy of it by striving after virtue. This doctrine as 
minimizing grace was repugnant to Augustine. He regarded 
mankind as sinful, guilty, ruined, incapable of any good. God 
alone can save. His grace is effectual and irresistible. As what 
God has done He has eternally willed to do, grace involves pre- 
destination. God has from eternity chosen those whom He wills 
to save (" election "), and consequently He has also passed over 
those whom He leaves to perish (" praeterition "). As all deserve 
damnation, there is no injustice in leaving them to their deserts. 
The " reprobation " of the wicked is not the cause of their sin; 
God's foreknowledge does not make the sin necessary; how repro- 
bation and foreknowledge are related is not made plain. 

The doctrine of Augustine was revived in the 9th century by 
Gottschalk, who taught that God's passing over the lost meant 
their predestination t to punishment. Hincmar of Reims perse- 
cuted him for not distinguishing the two positions. This dispute 
would have little interest now, had not Hincmar appealed to John 
Scotus Erigena, who attempted to solve the theological problem 
by philosophical conceptions. He denied that foreknowledge or 
predestination as temporal relations could be properly predicated 
of God as eternal ; he described sin and its consequences as negations, 
neither caused by nor known to God; he maintained that as evil 
is only a stage in the development of good, there will ultimately 
be a universal return to God. Thus the doctrine of reprobation 
was emptied of meaning. This defence of orthodoxy was con- 
demned ^ as heretical. The controversy was kept up during the 
scholastic period. Thomas Aquinas followed Augustine. Duns 
Scotus leaned toward Semi-Pelagianism, which rejected the doctrine 
of predestination, and maintained a co-operation of freedom and 
grace. While Aquinas affirmed the positions of Augustine, he 
deduced^ them from his Aristotelian conception of God as " first 
mover, itself unmoved." His original contribution to the subject 
was his theory of divine concurrence. He distinguishes secondary 
causes as natural and necessary, and as voluntary and contingent; 
though both are set in motion by God, yet as the natural 
remain "natural, so do the voluntary remain voluntary. But this 
is clearly only a verbal solution. 

At the Reformation the Augustinian position was accepted by 
both Luther and Calvin. Melanchthon modified his earlier view 
in the direction of synergism, the theory of a co-operation of divine 
grace and human freedom. The later Lutheran doctrine is " that 
man, unable as he is to will any good thing, can yet use the means 
of grace, and that these means of grace, carrying in themselves 
a divine power, produce a saving effect on all who do not 
voluntarily oppose their influence. Baptism, e.g. confers grace, 
which if not resisted is saving. And God, foreseeing who 
will and who will not, resist the grace offered, predestinates 
to life all who are foreseen as believers." Calvin's view is the 
same as Augustine's. He held the sublapsarian view that the 
fall was decreed, but not the supralapsanan view that it " was 
decreed as a means towards carrying out a previous decree to save 
some and leave others to perish." The latter view was held by 
Beza and other Calvinists, and, it is said, repelled Arminius from 



276 PREDICABLES— PRE-EXISTENCE, DOCTRINE OF 



Calvinism, and led him to formulate the doctrine that as repentance 
and faith are the divinely decreed conditions of eternal life, God 
has determined to give that life to all whom He foresees as fulfilling 
these conditions. According to Calvinism God's election unto 
salvation is absolute, determined by His own inscrutable will; 
according to Arminianism it is conditional, dependent on man's 
use of grace. The Synod of Dort (1618-1619) which affirmed the 
sublapsarian without excluding the supralapsarian form of Calvin- 
ism, condemned the views of Arminius and his followers, who were 
known as Remonstrants from the remonstrance " which in four 
articles repudiates supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism (which 
regarded the Fall as foreseen, but not decreed), and the doctrines 
of irresistibility of grace, and of the impossibility of the elect finally 
falling away from it, and boldly asserts the universality of grace. * 
In the Church of Rome the Dominicans favoured Augustinianism, 
the Jesuits Semi-Pelagianism ; the work of Molina on the agreement 
of free-will with the gifts of grace provoked a controversy, which 
the pope silenced without deciding; but which broke out again 
a generation later when Jansen tried to revive the decaying Augus- 
tinianism. The church of England has passed through several dis- 
putes regarding the question whether the Thirty-Nine Articles are 
Calvinistic or not ; while there is some ambiguity in the language, 
it seems to favour Calvinism. At the Evangelical Revival the 
old questions came up, as Wesley favoured Arminianism and 
George Whitefield Calvinism. In Scotland Calvinism was repudi- 
ated by James Morison, the founder of the Evangelical Union, 
who declared the three universalities, God's love for all, Christ's 
death for all, the Holy Spirit's working for all. 

While retained in the creeds of several denominations, in the 
public teaching of the churches the doctrine of predestination 
has lost its place and power. While the doctrine of election 
magnified God's grace, and so encouraged humility in man, it 
minimized man's freedom, and so produced either an over-confi- 
dence in those who believed themselves elect, or despair in those 
who could not reach the assurance. Now it is recognized that 
God's sovereignty must be conceived as consistent with man's 
liberty. While God fulfils His all-embracing purpose, that 
fulfilment leaves room for the exercise of individual freedom; 
the freedom God has bestowed on man He can so restrain and 
direct as to overrule even its abuse for His own gracious ends. 
That God desires that all should be saved, and that the salvation 
of each depends on his own choice — these are the general con- 
victions of modern theology. The problem now is the reconcili- 
ation of human freedom with divine foreknowledge. Martineau 
accepts Dugald Stewart's solution. " There is no absurdity in 
supposing that the deity may, for wise purposes, have chosen 
to open a source of contingency in the voluntary actions of his 
creatures, to which no prescience can possibly extend." Others 
hold the problem to be insoluble, and not needing to be solved. 

(A. E. G.*) 

PREDICABLES (Lat. praedicabilis, that which may be stated 
or affirmed ), in scholastic logic, a term applied to a classification 
of the possible relations in which a predicate may stand to its 
subject. The list given by the schoolmen and generally adopted 
by modern logicians is based on the original fivefold classification 
given by Aristotle (Topics, a iv. 101 b. 17-25): definition (&pos), 
genus (y'evos), differentia (5ia<£opa), property (Uu>v), accident 
(cvufiefHriKos). 1 The scholastic classification, obtained from 
Boetius's Latin version of Porphyry's Eisagoge, modified 
Aristotle's by substituting species (&8os) for definition. Both 
classifications are of universals, concepts or general terms, 
proper names of course being excluded. There is, however, a 
radical difference between the two systems. The standpoint 
of the Aristotelian classification is the predication of one uni- 
versal concerning another. The Porphyrian, by introducing 
species, deals with the predication of universals concerning 
individuals (for species is necessarily predicated of the indi- 
vidual), and thus created difficulties from which the Aristotelian 
is free (see below). 

The Aristotelian classification may be briefly explained: (1) The 
Definition of anything is the statement of its essence (Arist. t6 rl 
1jv elm), i.e. that which makes it what it is: e.g. "a triangle is 
a three-sided rectilineal figure." (2) Genus is that part of the 
essence which is also predicable of other things^ different from 
them in kind. A triangle is a rectilineal figure; i.e. in fixing the 
genus of a thing, we subsume it under a higher universal, of which 

1 Strictly Aristotle's classification is into four as StatfwpA really 
belongs to ykvot. 



it is a species. (3) Differentia is that part of the essence which 
distinguishes one species from another. As compared with quadri- 
laterals, hexagons, &c, all of which are rectilineal figures, a triangle 
is "differentiated " as having three sides. (4) A Property is an 
attribute which is common to all the members of a class, but is 
not part of its essence (i.e. need not be given in its definition). 
The fact that the interior angles of all triangles are equal to two 
right angles is not part of the definition, but is universally true. 
(5) An Accident is an attribute which may or may not belong to 
a subject. The colour of the human hair is an accident, for it 
belongs in no way to the essence of humanity. 

This classification, though it is of high value in the clearing up 
of our conceptions of the essential contrasted with the accidental, 
the relation of genus, differentia and definition and so forth, is of 
more significance in connexion with abstract sciences, especially 
mathematics, than for the physical sciences. It is superior on the 
whole to the Porphyrian scheme, which has grave defects. As has 
been said it classifies universals as predicates of individuals and 
thus involves the difficulties which cave rise to the controversy 
between realism and nominalism (q.v.J. How are we to distinguish 
species from genus ? Napoleon was a Frenchman, a man, an animal. 
In the second place how do we distinguish property and accident? 
Many so-calleci accidents are predicable necessarily of any particular 
persons. This difficulty gave rise to the distinction of separable and 
inseparable accidents, which is one of considerable difficulty. 

See the modern logic textbooks. 

PREDICAMENT, now used only in the sense of a dangerous 
or unpleasant position or situation. It meant properly that 
which is " predicated " or affirmed (Lat. praedicare) of anything, 
in logic, one of the ten Aristotelian categories (see Category), 
and so any definite state or condition. The use of " predica- 
ment " in the sense of " bad predicament," without the limiting 
adjective, is paralleled by " plight," for " bad plight," " success " 
for " good success." 

PREDICATION (from Lat. praedicare, to state, assert), in 
logic, the term which denotes the joining of a predicate to a 
subject in a judgment or proposition. The statement " all 
men are mortal " is to predicate mortality of all men. In other 
words a judgment is made up of a subject and a predicate joined 
by a copula. Since the true unit of thought is the judgment, 
since all concepts or universals exist only in continuous thinking 
(judging), the theory of predication is a fundamental part of logic. 
The true relation of subject and predicate has not been deter- 
mined with unanimity, various logicians emphasizing different 
aspects of the process (see Logic). The logical use of "predi- 
cate " is to be distinguished from the grammatical, which 
includes the verb, whether it be the verb " to be " in its various 
forms, or another verb. The simple grammatical sentence 
" he strokes the dog " the first word is the subject, while "strokes 
the dog " is the predicate, including verb and object. In logic 
every proposition is reducible to the form " A is B," " B " being 
the predicate. Thus the logical form of " he strokes the dog " 
would be "he is stroking the dog " or some other periphrasis 
which liberates and determines the logical predicate. The 
true significance of the logical copula is difficult. It cannot be 
described simply as a third (i.e. separate part) of the judgment, 
because until two terms are enjoined by it they are not subject 
and predicate. Much discussion has raged round the question 
whether the use of the verb " to be " as the copula implies that 
existence is predicated by the subject. It may be taken as 
generally agreed that this is not the case (see further Logic, and 
the textbooks). 

PRE-EXISTENCE, DOCTRINE OF, in theology, the doctrine 
that Jesus Christ had a human soul which existed before the 
creation of the world — the first and most perfect of created things 
— and subsisted, prior to His human birth, in union with the 
Second Person of the Godhead. It was this human soul which 
suffered the pain and sorrow described in the Gospels. The 
chief exposition of this doctrine is that of Dr Watts (Works, v. 
274, &c); it has received little support. In a wider form the 
doctrine has been applied to men in general — namely, that in the 
beginning of Creation God created the souls of all men, which 
were subsequently as a punishment for ill-doing incarnated in 
physical bodies till discipline should render them fit for spiritual 
existence. Supporters . of this doctrine, the Pre-existants or 
Pre-existiani, are found as early as the 2nd century, among

them being Justin Martyr and Origen (q.v.), and the idea not 
only belongs to metempsychosis and mysticism generally, but is 
widely prevalent in Oriental thought. It was condemned by the 
Council of Constantinople in 540, but has frequently reappeared 
in modern thought (cf. Wordsworth's Intimations of Immortality) 
being in fact the natural correlative of a belief in immortality. 

PREFACE (Med. Lat. prefatia, for classical praefatio, praefari, 
to speak beforehand), an introduction to a book, also -any 
preliminary or introductory statement. In liturgical use the 
term is applied to that portion of the Eucharistic service which 
immediately precedes the canon or central portion; the preface, 
which begins at the words Vere dignum, " It is very meet, right, 
&c," is ushered in, in all liturgies, with the Sursum Corda, 
"Lift up your hearts," and ends with the Sanctus, "Holy, Holy, 
Holy, &c." In the Western liturgies proper prefaces are 
appointed for particular occasions (sec Liturgy). 

PREFECT (prtfet), in France, the title of a high official. The 
prefects of the department were created by a law of the 28th 
Pluviosc in the year VIII. (Feb. 17, 1800). They were intended 
to be the chief organs of internal administration, and have, in 
fact, discharged this function, especially under the First and 
Second Empire, surviving, though with diminished importance, 
under the other forms of government which modern France has 
seen. In comparison with other French officials, they arc well 
paid (the salary nowadays ranges from 39,000 to 18,000 francs 
according to the class). 

In the administration of the ancien rigime the term " prefect " 
was not employed; practically the only case in which it occurs 
was in the organization of the establishment of institutions 
opened by the religious orders, in which there was generally a 
" prefect of the studies " (prifet des Uiides). In the year VIII. , 
in the discussion of the law of the 28th Pluviose, no reason was 
stated for the choice of this term. But like the " Tribunes " 
and " Consuls " of the constitution of the year VIII., it was 
taken from the Roman institutions which were then so fashion- 
able (see Praefect); it may also be recalled that Voltaire had 
used the term " prefecture " in speaking of the authority of 
Louis XIV. over the free towns of Alsace. 

The prefect has to a certain extent a double character and two 
series of functions. Firstly he is the general representative of the 
government, whose duty it is to ensure execution of the govern- 
ment's decisions, the exercise of the law, and the regular working 
of all branches of the public service in the department. In so far 
the r61e of the prefect is essentially political ; he guarantees the direct 
and legal action of the government in his department. He has the 
supervision of all the state services in his department, which pro- 
cures the necessary uniformity in the working of the services, 
each of which is specialized within a narrow sphere. He serves as 
a local source of information to the government, and transmits 
to it complaints or representations from those under his adminis- 
tration. In the name of the state he exercises a certain adminis- 
trative control over the local authorities, such as the conseil 
gtniral, the mayors and the municipal councils. This control, 
though considerably restricted by the law of the 10th of August 
1871, on the consols gSnSraux, and that of the 5th of April 1884, 
on municipal organization, still holds good in some important 
respects. The prefect can still annul certain decisions of the conseil 
gineral. He can suspend for a month a municipal council, mayor 
or deputy-mayor; certain decisions of the municipal councils 
require his approval; and he may annul such of their regulations 
as are extra vtres. He can annul or suspend the metre's decrees 
and he has also considerable control over public institutions, charit- 
able and otherwise. He may make regulations (reglements) both 
on special points, in virtue of various laws, and for the general 
administration of the police. 

When the prefects were created in the year VIII. the intendants 
of provinces of the ancien rigime were taken as a model, and there 
is a great resemblance between their respective functions. The 

C refect, however, is no more than an intendant in miniature, 
eing only at the head of a department, whereas the intendant 
was over a gfniralitt, which was a much larger district. In the 
same way the sous-prffcts correspond to the subdettgute of the 
intendants, with the difference that they are actual officials sub- 
ordinate to the prefects, while the subdHc'gtds were merely the 
representatives with whom the intendants provided themselves, 
and to whom they gave powers. 

Secondly, the prefect is not only the general representative of 
the government, but the representative of the department in the 
management of its local interests. But his unfettered powers in 



this respect have been reduced under the third Republic. This 
has chiefly been the effect of the law of the ioth of August 1871, 
which has led to decentralization, by increasing the powers of the 
conseils tfniraux. The law created a departmental committee 
(commission dipartcmcntaU), elected by the conseil gtniral which, 
in the interval of the sessions of the latter, takes part in matters 
concerning the administration of the departmental interests, 
either in virtue of the law, or by a delegation of powers from the 
conseil genSral. 

The sous-prefets, having very limited powers of deciding ques- 
tions, serve above all as intermediaries between the prefect and the 
persons under his administration. This function was most useful 
in the year VIII., when communications were difficult, even within 
a department, but nowadays it only leads to complications. 
As a matter of fact their chief service to the administration lies 
in keeping up good relations with the maires of the communes 
in their arrond%ssement t and thus acquiring a certain amount of 
influence over them. The National Assembly, which passed the 
law of the ioth of August 1871, had also decided to suppress the 
sous-prefets, but M. Thiers, who was then president of the Republic, 
persuaded them to reconsider this decision. Since then the Chamber 
of Deputies has on several occasions taken advantage of the budget 
to attempt the suppression of the sous-prSfets by refusing to vote 
the amount necessary for the payment of their salaries. But the 
government has always opposed this unconstitutional measure, 
holding that the suppression could only be effected by an organic 
law, and that it would necessarily involve a remodelling of the 
administrative organization. So far their view has prevailed in 
the Chambers. (J. p # £.) 

PREHNITE, a mineral consisting of calcium hydrogen ortho- 
silicate, H 2 Ca2Al 2 (Si04)3. It crystallizes in the hemimorphic 
class of the orthorhombic system, but the hemimorphic character 
is usually obscured by twinning. Crystals are generally platy 
in habit, but they rarely occur singly and distinctly shaped; 
almost invariably they are closely aggregated together to form 
barrel-shaped or globular groups with a crystalline surface. This 
form, together with the pale oil-green colour, gives the mineral 
a very characteristic appearance. It is translucent and has a 
vitreous lustre. The hardness is rather over 6 and the spec. grav. 
2 '80-2-95. Crystals are pyro-elcctric. Prehnite is sometimes 
classed with the zeolites, since it occurs under the same condi- 
tions as these minerals and often in association with them; the 
small amount of water (4-4%) is, however, expelled only at a 
red heat and is therefore not water of crystallization. 

Prehnite occurs as a mineral of secondary origin in the amygda- 
loidal cavities of^ basic igneous rocks, such as basalt and diabase, 
and less often, in veins in granite and gneiss. Fine specimens 
arc found with zeolites in the volcanic rocks of several places in 
the south of Scotland, e.g. Old Kilpatrick in Dumbartonshire, 
Bishopton in Renfrewshire, Campsie Hills in Stirlingshire and in 
the neighbourhood of Edinburgh; also at Paterson and Bergen 
Hill in New Jersey, and with native copper in the trap-rocks of the 
Lake Superior region. In the French (at Le Bourg d'Oisans) 
and Tyrolese Alps it occurs with axinite, epidote, felspar, &c, 
lining crevices in gneiss. Large masses have been found at Cradock 
in Cape Colony, from which locality it was brought in the 18th 
century by Colonel Prehn, the governor of the colony; hence the 
names " Cape chrysolite " and prehnite (of A. G. Werner, 1789). 
Prehnite is sometimes cut and polished for small ornaments; it 
then somewhat resembles chrysoprase in appearance. 

PREJUDICE (Lat. praejudieium), literally judgment or 
decision beforehand, which in classical usage meant a precedent, 
a preceding judgment, also a special form of judicial examination 
precedent to a trial, especially in matters relating to status. 
The transferred sense, of injury or damage inflicted by decisions 
or judgments disregarding interests affected, does not appear 
till post-classical times in Latin. This last use of damage appears 
in English in relation to legal matters, especially in the phrase 
" without prejudice," i.e. without detriment to rights or claims. 
When two parties are negotiating for the settlement of a dispute, 
statements or admissions made by or on behalf of cither, with a 
stipulation, expressed or implied, that the statements are made 
" without prejudice " to the party's claims in the dispute, 
cannot be put in evidence in litigation to settle the dispute (see 
Evidence). The general meaning of the word is that of opinion, 
favourable or hostile, based on prepossessions, and therefore 
biassed or unreasonable.

army from 1859 to 1872, when he retired with the rank of captain. 
He then gave himself up to philosophical work, especially in 
connexion with the phenomena of hypnotism and occultism 
from the modern psychological standpoint. He attempted to 
deduce the existence of spirit, apart from, and yet entering from 
time to time into connexion with, the phenomena of the senses, 
by an examination of the relation between the ego of thought 
and the age of sensible experience as understood by Kant. In 
1868 he received the degree of doctor from the university of 
Tubingen in recognition of a treatise on the psychology of 
Dreams {Oneirokritikon. Der Trattm vom Standptmkt des 
transcendentaien Idealismus). 

Subsequently, he published numerous works on various psycho- 
logical and scientific subjects, of which the more important are: 
Der gesunde Menschenver stand vor den Problemen der Wissen- 
schaft (1872); Der Kampf urns Dasein am Himmel (1874), repub- 
lished in 1882 under the title Entwickelungsgeschichte des Weltalls; 
Die Plane tenbewohner und die Nebtdarhypothese (1880); Die Philo~ 
sophie der Mystik (1885); Justinus Kerner und die Selierin von 
Prevorst (1886); Die monistische Seelenlehre (1888); Die Mystik 
der alien Griechen (1888); Kants mystische Weltanschauung (1889); 
Sludien aus dem Gebiete der Geheimwissenschaften (1890); Der 
Sfnritismus (1893); Die Entdeckung der Seele durch die Geheim- 
wissenschaften (1 894-1 895). In Der Kampf urns Dasein am Himmel 
von Prel endeavoured to apply the Darwinian doctrine of organic 
evolution not only to the sphere _ of _ consciousness but also even 
more widely as the philosophical principle of the world. He was one 
of a large number of German thinkers who during the latter half 
of the 19th century endeavoured to treat the mind as a mechanism. 
He died on the 4th of August 1899.

PRELATE (Lat. praelalus, set above, from praefero, prefer), 
an ecclesiastical dignitary of high rank. In the early middle ages 
the title prelate was applied to secular persons in high positions 
and thence it passed to persons having ecclesiastical authority. 
The De prelatis of Valerian is concerned with secular princes, 
and even as late as the 14th century the title was occasionally 
applied to secular magistrates. In medieval ecclesiastical 
usage the term might be applied to almost any person having 
ecclesiastical authority; it was very commonly given to the 
more dignified clergy of a cathedral church, but often also to 
ordinary priests charged with the cure of souls and, in the early 
days of monasticism, to monastic superiors, even to superiors 
of convents of women. The term occurs very frequently in 
the Rule of St Benedict and other early monastic rules. 

In more modern usage in the Roman Catholic Church prelates, 
properly so-called, are those who have jurisdiction in foro 
externo, but a liberal interpretation has given the title a more 
general significance. Prelacy is defined by the canonists as 
" pre-eminence with jurisdiction " (praeeminentia cum juris- 
dictions), and the idea supposes an episcopal or quasi-episcopal 
jurisdiction. But gradually the title was extended to ecclesias- 
tical persons having a prominent office even without jurisdiction, 
and later still it has come to be applied to ecclesiastical persons 
marked by some special honour though without any definite 
office or jurisdiction. 

We may therefore distinguish " true " from " titular " 
prelates. The true prelacy is composed of the persons who 
constitute the ecclesiastical hierarchy; jurisdiction is inherent 
in their office and gives pre-eminence, as with patriarchs, arch- 
bishops and bishops. A good example of the dependence of 
prelacy on jurisdiction is found in those religious orders, such as 
the Dominicans, where authority is strictly elective and tem- 
porary. Thus a Dominican prior ranks ipso facto as a prelate 
during his three years of office, but, if not re-elected, loses this 
dignity with his jurisdiction. 

The true, no less than the titular, prelates have their various 
ranks, differing as regards title, precedence, clothing and other 
insignia. The distinguishing colour of a prelate's clothing is 
violet; the form, like the greater or less use of violet, depends 
on the rank of the prelate. Four classes may he distinguished: 

(1) Great prelates, e.g. cardinals, archbishops and bishops. 

(2) Exempt prelates (praelati ntdlius dioeceseos, praelati nullius), 
i.e. abbots and religious superiors, who are withdrawn from the 
ordinary diocesan jurisdiction and themselves possess episcopal 



jurisdiction (jurisdictio quasi episcopates). (3) Roman prelates, 
(a) active and (b) honorary. The title is applied to numerous 
ecclesiastics attached by some dignity, active or honorary, to 
the Roman court (see Curia Romana). In the list of these 
prelates are protonotaries apostolic, domestic prelates, private 
chamberlains, participanti and supernumerary. Of these last 
there are two kinds, honorary and honorary extra urbem. Only 
protonotaries and domestic prelates are for life; the others lose 
their dignity at the death of the pope who appointed them. A 
special class of Roman prelatures exist at Rome, endowed as a 
kind of ecclesiastical majority to which those members of certain 
families who are destined for the clerical life naturally succeed. 

In the reformed churches the title was retained in England, 
Sweden, Denmark and Germany. The cathedral chapter of 
Brandenburg consists of two prelates, the dean and the senior, 
besides eight other members. The chapter of Merseburg con- 
tains five prelates, viz. the dean, senior, provost, custos and 
scholasticus. In Baden the general synod is presided over by 
the prelate (prelaf), i.e. the principal "superintendent." In 
the Church of England the term prelate has been since the 
Reformation applied only to archbishops and bishops. The 
word " prelacy," meaning no more originally than the office and 
dignity of a prelate, came to be applied in Presbyterian Scotland 
and Puritan England — especially during the 17th century — to 
the episcopal form of church government, being used in a 
derogatory sense.

PRELLER, FRIEDRICH (1804-1878), German landscape- 
painter, was born at Eisenach on the 25th of April 1804. After 
studying drawing at Weimar, he went in 1821, on Goethe's 
advice, to Dresden, where in 1824 he was invited to accompany 
the grand duke of Weimar to Belgium. He became a pupil 
in the academy at Antwerp. From 1827 to 1831 he studied in 
Italy, and in 1831 received an appointment in the Weimar school 
of art. In 1834-1836 he executed in tempera six pictures on 
subjects taken from the Odyssey in the " Roman House " at 
Leipzig, in 1836-183 7 the landscapes with scenes from Oberon in 
the Wieland room in the grand-ducal palace at Weimar, and in 
1 836-1848 six frescoes on Thuringian subjects commissioned by 
the grand duchess. In 1840 he visited Norway and produced a 
number of easel works, some of which are preserved at Weimar. 
In 1859 he revisited Italy, and on his return in 1861 he completed 
for the grand-ducal museum the frescoes illustrative of the 
Odyssey, which are held to constitute his chief claim to fame. 
Preller, who was also a successful etcher, died at Weimar on the 
23rd of April 1878. 

PRELLER, LUDWIG (1800-1861), German philologist and 
antiquarian, was born at Hamburg on the 15th of September 
1809. After having studied at Leipzig, Berlin and Gottingen, 
in 1838 he was appointed to the professorship of philology at 
Dorpat, which, however, he resigned in 1843. He afterwards 
spent some time in Italy, but settled in Jena in 1844, where he 
became professor in 1846. In the same year he removed as 
head librarian to Weimar, where he died on the 21st of June 1861. 
His chief works are: Demeter u. Persephone (1837); Griechische 
Mythologie (1854-1855; 4th ed., by C. Robert, 1887 seq.); and 
Romische Mythologie (1858; 3rd ed. by H. Jordan, 1881-1883). 
He also co-operated with H. Ritter in the preparation of the 
most useful Historia philosophiae graecae et romanae ex fontium 
locis contexta (1838; ed. E. Wellmann, 1898). He contributed 
extensively to Ersch and Gruber's Allgemeine Encyklopadie and 
Pauly's Realencyklopddie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft. 
A complete list of his works will be found in Ausgewahlte 
Aufsatze aus dem Gebiete der klassischen Alteriumswissenschoft 
(ed. R. Kohler, 1864).

PREMIUM— PRERAU

PREMIUM (Lat. praemium, profit, reward, prae+emere, to 
buy), in general, a reward or prize; a consideration. In the law 
of insurance, the sum of money or consideration (either annual 
or in a lump sum) which the insured pays the insurers in order 
to gain a certain amount in the event of some specific loss 
happening is termed a premium. The word is applied to the 
fee paid in consideration of being taught a trade or profession. 
It is also used in the sense of " bonus," as something beyond 
or additional, as in the phrases, " premium bonus system," 
" premium system," where a bonus or sum is given in addition 
to wages in proportion to the value of the work done. On the 
stock exchange, when a security has not yet been fully paid 
up, it is customary to quote its price at par, or so much premium 
or discount. Par represents the amount actually paid up on it, 
while if it is above the level it is said to be at a premium of so 
much, or if below at a discount. 

PREMONITION (from Lat. prae, before, monere, to advise 
or warn), an impression relating to a future event. Strictly 
the word should mean a warning proceeding from an external 
source. Its modern extension to all forms of impression sup- 
posed to convey information as to the future is justified on the 
assumption that such intimations commonly originate in the 
subliminal consciousness of the percipient and are thence trans- 
ferred to the ordinary consciousness. In modern times the best 
attested premonitions are those relating to events about to occur 
in the subject's own organism. It was observed by the animal 
magnetists at the beginning of the 19th century in France and 
Germany, that certain of their subjects, when in the " magnetic " 
trance, could foretell accurately the course of their diseases, 
the date of the occurrence of a crisis and the length of time needed 
to effect a cure. Similar observations were subsequently 
recorded in Great Britain and in America (see, for instance, the 
case of Anna Winsor, 1 860-1 863, reported by Dr Ira Barrows). 
The power of prediction possessed by the subject in such cases 
may be explained in two ways: (1) As due to an abnormal 
power of perception possessed by certain persons, when in the 
hypnotic trance, of the working of their own pathological 
processes; or (2) more probably, as the result of self-suggestion; 
the organism is " set " to explode at a given date in a crisis, 
or to develop the fore-ordained symptoms. 

Apart from these cases there are two types of alleged pre- 
monitions. (1) The future event may be foreshadowed by a 
symbol. Amongst the best known of these symbolic impressions 
are banshees, corpse lights, phantom funeral processions, 
ominous animals or sounds and symbolic dreams {e.g. of teeth 
falling out). Of all such cases it is enough to say that it is 
impossible for the serious inquirer to establish any causal con- 
nexion between the omen and the event which it is presumed 
to foreshadow. (2) There .are many instances, recorded by 
educated witnesses, of dreams, visions, warning voices, &c, giving 
precise information as to coming events. In some of these 
cases, where the dream, &c, has been put on record before its 
" fulfilment " is known, chance is sufficient to explain the coin- 
cidence, as in the recorded cases of dreams foretelling the winner 
of the Derby or the death of a crowned head. In cases where 
such an explanation is precluded by the nature of the details 
foreshadowed, the evidence is found to be defective, generally 
from the absence of contemporary documents. The persistent 
belief on the part of the narrators in the genuineness of their 
previsions indicates that in some cases there may be a halluci- 
nation of memory, analogous to the well known feeling of " false 
recognition." Prof. Josiah Royce has suggested for this supposed 
form of hallucination the term " pseudo-presentiment."

PREMONSTRATENSIANS, also called Norbertines, and in 
England White Canons, from the colour of the habit: an order 



of Augustinian Canons founded in n 20 by St Norbert, after- 
wards archbishop of Magdeburg. He had made various efforts 
to introduce a strict form of canonical life in various communities 
of canons in Germany; in 1120 he was working in the diocese 
of Laon, and there in a desert place, called Pr6montr6, in Aisne, 
he and thirteen companions established a monastery to be the 
cradle of a new order. They were canons regular and followed 
the so-called Rule of St Augustine (see Aucustinians), but with 
supplementary statutes that made the life one of great austerity. 
St Norbert was a friend of St Bernard of Clairvaux — and he was 
largely influenced by the Cistercian ideals as to both the manner 
of life and the government of his order. But as the Premonstra- 
tensians were not monks but canons regular, their work was 
preaching and the exercise of the pastoral office, and they served 
a large number of parishes incorporated in their monasteries. 
The order was founded in 1120; in n 26, when it received papal 
approbation, there were nine houses; and others were established 
in quick succession throughout western Europe, so that at 
the middle of the 14th century there are said to have been over 
1300 monasteries of men and 400 of women. The Premonstra- 
tensians played a predominant part in the conversion of the 
Wends and the Christianizing and civilizing of the territories 
about the Elbe and the Oder. In time mitigations and relaxa- 
tions crept in, and these gave rise to reforms and semi-indepen- 
dent congregations within the order. The Premonstratensians 
came into England (c. 1143) first at Ncwhouse in Lincoln, and 
before the dissolution under Henry VIII. there were 35 houses. 
At the beginning of the 19th century the order had been almost 
exterminated, only eight houses surviving, all in the Austrian 
dominions. There are now some 20 monasteries and 1000 
canons, who serve numerous parishes; and there are two or three 
small houses in England. The strength of the order now lies 
in Belgium, where at Tongerloo is a great Premonstratensian 
abbey that still maintains a semblance of its medieval state.

PREMYSL, the reputed ancestor of the line of dukes and kings 
which ruled in Bohemia from 873 or earlier until, the murder 
of Wenceslaus III. in 1306, and which was known as the Pfemy- 
slide dynasty. According to legend Premysl was a peasant of 
Staditz who attracted the notice of Libussa, daughter of a certain 
Krok, who ruled over a large part of Bohemia, and is said to 
have been descended from Samo. Pfemysl married Libussa, 
the traditional foundress of Prague, and during the 8th century 
became prince of the Bohemian Cechs. His family became 
extinct when Wenceslaus III. died, but through females the 
title to Bohemia passed from the Pfemyslides to the house of 
Luxemburg and later to the house of Habsburg.

PRENZLAU, or Prenzlow, a town of Germany, in the Prussian 
province of Brandenburg. It lies on the lower Ucker See, 30 m. 
W. by S. of Stettin by rail. Pop. (1905), 20,929. The Gothic 
church of St Mary (Evangelical), dating from 1340, is one of the 
finest churches in the district, and the remains of the town gates, 
walls and towers are also interesting. The industries include wool- 
spinning, iron-founding, brewing and sugar-refining. Tobacco 
is grown in the neighbourhood, and cigars are manufactured in 
the town. 

Prenzlau is first mentioned in a document of the close of the 
1 2th century, and received its municipal charter in 1235. As 
the capital of the old Uckermark it was a frequent object of 
dispute between Pomerania and Brandenburg until incorporated 
with the latter about 1480. At Prenzlau Prince Hohenlohe, with 
his corps of 12,000 men, surrendered to Murat on the retreat 
after the battle of Jena in October 1806.

PREROGATIVE 



Czech. It is one of the oldest towns in Moravia, and possesses 
a Gothic town-hall and an old castle, once occupied by Matthias 
Corvinus. It has an important cloth industry, and manufactures 
of sugar, ropes, machinery and agricultural implements. Prerau 
was at one time the chief seat of the Moravian Brethren. 

PREROGATIVE, in law, an exclusive privilege of the Crown. 
The word, originally an adjective, is derived from the centuria 
praerogativa, or century which voted first on a proposed law 
(rogatio) in the Roman comitia centuriata. In English law, 
Blackstone says, " by the word prerogative we are to understand 
the character and power which the sovereign hath over and 
above all other persons, in right of his regal dignity; and which, 
though part of the common law of the country, is out of its 
ordinary course. This is expressed in its very name, for it 
signifies, in its etymology, something that is required or demanded 
before, or in preference to, all others " (Stephen's Cotnm. vol. ii. 
bk. iv. pt. i. ch. vi.). The prerogative is sometimes called jura 
regalia or regalia, the regalia being either major a, the regal 
dignity and power, or minora, the revenue of the Crown. 

The theory of English law as to the prerogative of the king 
seems to be not quite consistent. On the one hand, he is a 
perfect and irresponsible being, holding his office by divine right; 
George V., " by the Grace of God of Great Britain and Ireland 
King," 1 is still the heading of every writ. On the other hand, 
his powers are defined and limited by law. This is laid down 
as early as the 13th century (Bracton, 5b). A consequence of 
this position is that the prerogative may be confined or extended 
by the supreme legislative authority, and that the courts have 
jurisdiction to decide whether or not any alleged right falls 
within the prerogative. The prerogative of the Crown, still of 
great extent, has been gradually limited by a long series of enact- 
ments, the most worthy of notice being Magna carta, Confir- 
matio cartarum, *Prerogativa regis, the Petition of Right, the 
Habeas Corpus Act, the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement. 
The most important of the obsolete prerogatives which have been 
at one time claimed and exercised are the following: (r) the right 
to impose a tax upon the subject without the consent of parlia- 
ment. (2) The right to dispense with the obligation of statutes, 
by the insertion in a grant of the clause non obstante statuto (see 
Dispensation). (3) The right of purveyance and pre-emption 
— that is, of buying up provisions at a valuation without the 
consent of the owner — and the right of impressing carriages and 
horses (see Purveyance). (4) The authority to erect tribunals 
not proceeding according to the ordinary course of justice was 
declared illegal by 16 Car. I. c. 10 (the act dissolving the Star 
Chamber, the court of the marches of Wales, and the court of 
the president and council of the north). (5) The revenue from 
first-fruits and tenths (see Annates). (6) The right of corody — 
that is, of sending one of the royal chaplains to be maintained 
by a bishop until the bishop promotes him to a benefice — has 
become obsolete by disuse. (7) The right by forfeiture to the 
property of a convict upon his conviction for treason or felony 
was abolished by the Felony Act 1870. (8) The immunity of 
the Crown from payment of costs has been taken away in almost 
all cases. (9) The right to alienate crown lands by grant at 
pleasure was taken away by 1 Anne c. 8. In very few cases has 
the prerogative been extended by statute; the Regulation of 
the Forces Act was an example of such extension. By that act 
the jurisdiction of lords-lieutenant of counties over the auxiliary 
forces was revested in the Crown. 

The prerogative may be exercised in person or by delegation. 
The prerogative of conferring honours is generally (though not 
necessarily) exercised by the king in person, as in the case of 
investment with knighthood and military or civil decorations. 
The delegation of the prerogative often takes place by commis- 
sion, issued with or without a joint address from both houses of 
parliament. Parts of the prerogative — generally in the nature of 
profit, and so in derogation of the revenue of the Crown — may be 

1 There is no difference in the prerogative as exercised by a king 
or a queen regnant, so that the word " king " in its constitutional 
sense includes queen. That the queen regnant has the same rights 
as a king was declared by 1 Mary sess. 3, c. 1. 



conferred upon subjects by grant in letters patent, which will be 
presumed after enjoyment by the subject for a certain time. 
What in the king is a prerogative becomes a franchise in the 
subject, e.g. chases, warrens, wrecks, treasure-trove, courts-leet. 

The existing prerogatives may be divided, with Blackstone, into 
such as are direct and such as are by way of exception ; or perhaps 
better, with Chief Baron Comyns, into those affecting external 
relations and those affecting internal relations. Under the first 
class would fall the power of making war and concluding peace. 
As incidents to this power the king has the right of sending and 
receiving ambassadors, of concluding treaties, and of granting 
passports, safe-conducts, letters of marque and reprisals. These 
rights may be limited by international agreement; thus the Declara- 
tion of Paris, 1856, abolished privateering as far as the assenting 
nations (of whom Great Britain was one) were concerned. 

The prerogatives affecting internal relations may be conveni- 
ently, if not scientifically, classified as personal, political, judicial, 
ecclesiastical and fiscal. 

Personal. — In order that there may always be an existing head 
of the -state the king is regarded as a corporation. He cannot die ; 
there can only be a demise of the Crown — that is, a transfer of the 
royal authority to a different person. On the same principle the 
king cannot be under age, though in cases where the king has been 
of tender years a protector or regent has usually been appointed 
for administrative purposes. The king is personally irresponsible 
for crime or tort, it being an ancient common law maxim that the 
king can do no wrong, and that any injury suffered by a subject at 
the hands of the king is to be attributed to the mistake of his 
advisers. A curious consequence of this irresponsibility is that the 
king is apparently the only person in the realm who cannot under 
any circumstances arrest a suspected felon, for no action for false 
imprisonment would lie against him, and in the event of the arrest 
of an innocent person there would be a wrong without a remedy. 
He cannot be^ guilty of laches, or negligence. The maxim of the 
common law is " Nullum tempus oecurrit rcgi." This is still the 
law in criminal matters. With a very few exceptions, such as 
prosecutions for treason and offences against the customs, no lapse 
of time will in England (though it is otherwise in Scotland) bar the 
right of the Crown to prosecute. The king is exempt from taxation 
on the ground that, as the revenue of the realm is his prerogative, 
it js useless for him to tax himself. But lands purchased by the 
privy purse are liable to taxation (39 & 40 Geo. III. c. 88, s. 6). 
He is also exempt from tolls (which can only exist as a franchise 
granted by him), and from the poor-rate, as he is not mentioned in 
the Poor Law Acts. His person cannot be arrested or his goods 
distrained or taken in execution. The privilege of exemption 
from taxation applies to his palaces and to the public buildings 
of the state. No kind of judicial process can be executed in a 
palace as long as it continues to be a royal residence. The privilege 
does not attach to palaces which the king has ceased to use as a 
dwelling, such as Hampton Court. The king has also several 
personal privileges of minor importance, such as the title of 
" majesty," the right to a royal salute, to the use of the royal 
standard and of special liveries, &c. 

Political. — The king is the supreme executive and co-ordinate 
legislative authority. As such authority he has the attribute of 
sovereignty 2 or pre-eminence, and the right to the allegiance of 
his subjects. All land is mediately or immediately held of him. 
Land derelict suddenly by the sea, land newly discovered by sub- 
jects and islands arising in the sea are his. As paramount authority 
in parliament he can dissolve or prorogue it at pleasure, but cannot 
prolong it beyond seven years. In theory parliament only exists 
at his will, for it is summoned by his writ, and the vote for a member 
of parliament is only a franchise, not a right existing independently 
of his grant. He can refuse his assent to a bill passed by the 
houses of parliament. This right has, however, not been exercised 
since 1707, when Queen Anne refused the royal assent to a Scottish 
Militia Bill. The king has power to issue proclamations and (with 
the assent of the privy council) orders in council, in some cases as 
part of the ancient prerogative, in others under^ the provisions 
of an act of parliament. Proclamations are only binding so far as 
they are founded upon and enforce the laws of the realm. They 
cannot alter the common law or create a new offence. The king 
is the fountain of honour; as such he has the valuable power of 
granting peerages at will, so far as he is not restrained by any 
act of parliament, and so far as he keeps within certain constitu- 
tional limits, e.g. he cannot insert a shifting clause in a patent of 
peerage. He also confers all other titles of honour, whether heredi- 
tary or not, and grants precedence and armorial bearings. The 
great officers of state are appointed by the king. The only restric- 
tion upon the creation of offices is that he cannot create new offices 
with new fees attached to them, or annex new fees to old offices, 
for this would be to impose a tax upon the subject without an act 

s The word " sovereign " is frequently applied to the king in 
legal works. It should be borne in mind at the same time that the 
king is not a sovereign in the strict sense in which the term is used 
by Austin.

of parliament. The king, as head of the state, is in supreme com- 
mand of the army and navy for the defence of the realm. This 
right, contested by the Long Parliament, was finally declared by 
13 Car. II. c. 6 to be in the king alone. The right of command 
carries with it as an^ incident the right to build forts and defences, 
10 impress seamen in case of necessity, and to prohibit the im- 
portation of munitions of war (39 & 40 Vict. c. 36, s. 43), also the 
right to the soil of the foreshore and of estuaries of rivers, and the 
jurisdiction over territorial waters. Other rights which fall under 
the political branch of the prerogative may be called the commercial 
rights, including the coining of money, the regulating of weights 
and measures, the establishing of markets and fairs, and the erecting 
of beacons, lighthouses and sea-marks. As parens patriae he is 
ex officio guardian of infants, idiots and lunatics. It is scarcely 
necessary to point out that all these prerogatives (except the 
conferring of honours and such prerogatives as are purely j>ersonal) 
are exercised through responsible ministers, practically in these 
days members ol the party to which the majority of the House of 
Commons belongs. Thus the jurisdiction over infants, &c, is 
exercised in England by the lord chancellor; and over beacons, &c , 
by the Trinity House, under the general superintendence of the 
Board of Trade. 

Judicial. — The king is the fountain of justice, and the supreme 
conservator of the peace of the realm. As supreme judge the king 
has the appointment of all judicial officers (other than those in 
certain local courts), who act as his deputies. He may constitute 
legal courts for the administration of the general law of the land, 
but he cannot erect tribunals not proceeding according to the 
known and established law of the realm, such as the Star Chamber 
or the commissions of martial law forbidden by the Petition of 
Right. Nor can he add to the jurisdiction of courts; thus he cannot 
give a spiritual court temporal powers. The king was in theory 
supposed to be present in court. Actions in the king's bench 
were until modern times said to be coram rege ipso, ana the king 
could not be non-suited, for a non-suit implied the non-appearance 
of the plaintiff in court. The king enforces judgment fey means 
of the sheriff, who represents the executive authority. As supreme 
conservator of the peace, the king, through the lord-lieutenant in 
counties, and^ through the lord chancellor in cities and boroughs, 
appoints justices of the peace. In the same capacity he is the 
prosecutor of crimes. All indictments still conclude with the 
words "against the peace of our lord the king, his crown and 
dignity." As it is the king's peace that is broken by the com- 
mission of a crime, the king has, as the offended party, the power 
of remission. The king cannot be sued by ordinary action. He 
may sue by ordinary action, but he has the advantage of being able 
to use prerogative process (see below). He has the right of inter- 
vention in all litigation^ where his rights are concerned, or in the 
interests of public justice, as where collusion is alleged between 
the decree^ nisi and the decree absolute in divorce. Crown debts 
have priority in administration and bankruptcy. 

Ecclesiastical. — The king is recognized as " supreme governor " 
of the Church by 26 Hen. VIII. c. 1, and 1 Eliz. c. 1. By this preroga- 
tive he convenes and dissolves convocation and nominates to vacant 
bishoprics and other ecclesiastical preferments. The dean and 
chapter of a cathedral cannot proceed to the election of a bishop 
without the king's permission to elect (see Conge d'Elire). When 
any benefice is vacant by the promotion of the incumbent to a 
bishopric other thana colonial bishopric the king has the patronage 
pro hoc vice. The king cannot create new ecclesiastical jurisdiction 
in England or in colonies other than crown colonies. Where a new 
bishopric is created it is under the powers of an act of parliament. 
Fiscal.— The theory of the constitution is that the king, being 
entrusted with the defence of the realm and the administration of 
justice, must have sufficient means given him for the purpose. 
The bulk of the revenue of the Norman and Plantagenet kings was 
derived from crown lands and feudal dues. At the present day the 
rents of crown lands form a very small part of the revenue, and the 
feudal dues do not exist except in the pecuniarily unimportant 
cases of escheat, royal fish, wrecks, treasure trove, waifs and strays, 
&c. Of the revenue a comparatively small part (the civil list) 
is paid to the king in person, the rest (the consolidated fund) is 
applied to public purposes. 

Prerogative Process. — This is the name given to certain methods 
of procedure which the Crown alone has the right of using; such 
are inquest of office (an inquiry by jury concerning the right of the 
Crown to land or goods), extent (a mode of execution), scire facias 
(for the resumption of a grant), and information (by which pro- 
ceedings are commenced in the name of the attorney-general for 
a public wrong or for injury to crown property). 

Prerogative Writs. — Certain writs are called " prerogative writs," 
as distinguished from writs of right, because it is within the pre- 
rogative to issue or reissue them (see Writ).

Growth of the Royal Prerogative in England; Chitty, The Prerogative

Law; and the works of W. Bagehot, S. Low, A. V. Dicey and Sir

• PREROGATIVE COURTS, the name given to the English 
provincial courts of Canterbury and York, as far as regarded 
their jurisdiction over the estates of deceased persons. 

They had jurisdiction to grant probate or administration where 
the diocesan courts could not entertain the case owing to the de- 
ceased having died possessed of goods above the value of £5 {bona 
notabilia) in each of two or more dioceses. The jurisdiction of the 

Crcrogative courts was transferred to the Court of Probate in 1857 
y the Probate Court Act, and is now vested in the Probate, 
Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice by 
the Judicature Act 1875. In the state of New Jersey, United 
States, the court having jurisdiction over probate matters is called 
the Prerogative Court. 

PRESBYTER (Gr. irpeaflvTepos, elder, the comparative of 
Tpeafivs, an old man), the title borne from very early times by 
certain officers or ministers of the Christian Church intermediate 
between " bishops " and " deacons." The specialized use of 
the word as implying not only age, but consequently wisdom and 
authority, is analogous to that of "senate " (from senior), of 
"gerousia" (from yepw), and of "elder." It is the original 
form of priest {q.v.). The word is not found in pre-Christian 
writings except in the Septuagint, though as Deissmann has 
shown it is found on the Papyri as an official title for the village 
magistrates of Egypt and the members of the yepovaia, or senate, 
of many towns in Asia Minor. The office is, however, closely 
analogous to, and perhaps founded on, a similar office in the 
Jewish synagogue organization among the officials of which 
were the zekenim, or elders, sometimes identified with the archi- 
synagogues. In the New Testament the Greek word is used both 
for the ancient Jewish official and for the Christian elder. On 
Jewish tombstones of the Hellenistic period the title is frequently 
found, sometimes applied to women. The head official of the 
English Jews prior to their expulsion bore the title of Presbyter 
judacorum; opinions differ as to whether this -officer was eccles- 
iastical or had merely the secular duty of supervising the 
exchequer of the Jews (see further The Jewish Encyclopedia , 
1905, x. 190, 191). 

The history of presbyteral government as opposed to episcopacy 
and pure Congregationalism is riot known in detail. After the 
Reformation, however, it was adopted by Calvin and his followers, 
who created^ that system which has ever since been known as 
Presbyterianism (q.vj. There are many theories as to the origin of 
the office of presbyter in the Christian Church. (1) Some connect 
it with the appointment of the seven recorded in Acts vi. This 
is the view taken by Boehmer, 1 RitschP and Lindsay.* It is 
urged that the traditional view which regards the seven as deacons 
is untenable because the term " deacon " is never used in the narra- 
tive, and there is no reference to the office in the Acts. On the 
other hand the officials of the Jerusalem church are always called 
" elders " and when they are first introduced (Acts xi. 30) appear 
to be discharging the functions for which " the seven " were specially 
set apart. (2) The view adopted by the majority of English 
scholars is, while refusing to accept the connexion between the 
presbyters and the seven, to regard the office as distinctly primitive 
and say that it was taken over by the earliest Christian community 
at Jerusalem from the Jewish synagogue. 4 (3) Harnack and a 
few other modern scholars * maintain that the office of presbyter 
did not come into existence till the 2nd century. During the last 
quarter of 'the 1st century, a three-fold organization is found in 
the Church: (a) a spiritual organization composed of "apostles, 
prophets and teachers who had been awakened by the spirit and by 
the spirit endowed "; (6) an administrative organization, " For the 
care of the poor, for worship, for correspondence, the congregation 
needed controlling officials. These were the bishop and the deacons, 
the former for higher, the latter for inferior services "; (c) a patri- 
archal organization based upon the natural deference of the younger 
to the older members of the Church. The senior members of the 
community, by virtue of their age and experience, watched over 
the conduct and guided the action of the younger and less experi- 
enced portion of the Church, though they held no official position 
and were not appointed for any particular work like the bishops 
and deacons. In the 2nd century the patriarchal element in the 
organization was merged in the administrative, and the presbyterb

became a definite order in the ministry. The time at which the 
change occurred cannot be definitely fixed. "In some congrega- 
tions," as Harnack says, " it may have been long before the elders 
were chosen, in others this may have come very soon; in some the 
sphere of the competency of the presbyters and patrons may have 
been quite indefinite and in others more precise." Hamack's 
theory is based upon the following arguments: (a) The silence 
of the genuine Epistles of St Paul and the Epistle to the Hebrews. 
In 1 Cor. xii. 28 Paul says that God has given to the Church apostles, 
prophets, teachers, miracles, gifts of healing, helps, governments; 
but of presbyters he has not a word to say. Even from passages 
where he is speaking of the jurisdiction of the congregation, as 
for example in 1 Cor. v., vi., the presbyters are absent, while in 
Phil. i. 1 it is the bishops and deacons that he mentions. t (b) The 
documents in which presbyters are mentioned in an official sense, 
viz. the Epistle of James, the first Epistle of Peter, the Acts of the 
Apostles and the Pastoral Epistles belong to a later age and reflect 
the customs of their own day rather than those of the primitive 
Church, (c) Even Clement of Rome does not say that the apostles 
had appointed presbyters in the congregation, he speaks only of 
bishops and deacons. For this reason the statement in Acts xiv. 
23 is to be looked upon with suspicion. These arguments, however, 
are not absolutely decisive. It is true that presbyters are not 
mentioned in the genuine Epistles of St Paul, but there are 
hints that similar officers existed in some of the churches founded by 
the apostle. There is a reference in 1 Thess. v. 12 to " those 
who rule over you " (Trpolar&ixtvoi), and the same word occurs in 
Rom. xii. 8. 1 The term " governments " {tcvptpv-qatis) in 1 Cor. 
xiv. 28 obviously refers to men who discharged the same functions 
as presbyters. If too, as seems most probable, bishops and pres- 
byters were practically identical, there is of course a specific refer- 
ence to them in Phil. i. 1. The "leaders" who are mentioned 
three times in Hebrews xiii. were also probably " presbyters " 
under another name. ^ Harnack's second argument depends for 
its validity upon certain conclusions with regard to the date of 
James and 1 Peter, which are not universally accepted. Few 
English scholars, for instance, would accept as late a elate as 120- 
140 for James, and 1 Peter may be as early as 65, as Harnack 
himself admits, though he prefers a date in the reign of Domitian. 
If this possibility in regard to 1 Peter is granted, it is fatal to the 
theory, because at the time when the epistle was written official 

Eresbyters were so well established that abuse and degeneration 
ad already begun to creep in and some of the elders were already 
guilty of lording it over their heritage " and making a profit 
out of their office (1 Pet. v. 1-4). With regard to the testimony 
of Acts, the only question, since Harnack admits the Lucan author- 
ship, 2 is whether Luke^ is describing the organization of the Church 
as it existed at the time of the events recorded or reflecting the 
arrangements which prevailed at the time when the book was written. 
It is difficult to see how Luke can have been wrong with regard to 
the " Ephesian elders " who came to meet Paul at Miletus since he 
was present on the occasion (xx. 15-17). The only "mistake that 
seems possible is that he may have conferred a later title upon the 
emissaries of the Church of Ephesus. This is not likely, but, at 
all events, it would only prove that the office under another name 
existed at Ephesus, for otherwise Luke could not possibly have 
put into the mouth of Paul the address which follows. Neither 
is there prima facie ground for objecting to the statements with 
regard to the presbyters of Jerusalem. If the Church at Jerusalem 
had any officials, it is highly probable that those officials bore 
the name and took over the functions of the elders of the synagogue. 
The statement in Acts xiv. 23, that Paul and Barnabas appointed 
elders in the churches of South Galatia, is more open to objection 
perhaps, owing to the silence of the Epistle to the Galatians. With 
regard to the evidence of the Epistle of Clement, Harnack seems to 
be incorrect in his conclusions. Scholars of such opposite schools 
of thought as Schmiedel 3 and Lindsay 4 maintain that the epistle 
contains the most explicit references to presbyters of the official 
type. The crucial passage (xliv. 4-6) seems to bear out their 
contention. " It will be no light sin for us if we thrust out of the 
oversight (cxwkott^) those who have offered the gifts unblameably 
and holily. Blessed are those presbyters who have gone before 
. . .for they have no fear lest any one should remove them from 
their appointed place" (bird rod Wpvfxet/ov rbirov). There is an 
equally specific reference in Iiv. 2: "Only let the flock of Christ 
keep peace with its duly-appointed presbyters "(fitra ruv Kadiarankvuv 
irptafivrepw). 

The conclusions which we seem to reach are as follows: (1) In the 
earliest stage (between 30 and 60) there is no uniform organization 



1 Hort translates it polar &txtvoi " those who care for you," but 
1 Tim. iii. 12 and v. 17 seem to be against this. In Justin Martyr, 
ApoL i. 67, irpocar&s evidently refers to " the president of the 
church," and in a recently discovered papyrus which Ramsay dates 
303 a certain bishop is described as XaoO *■ polar ap.wov t Studies in

in the Christian Church. Presbyters are found in Jerusalem 
from primitive times. In the Pauline churches the name is not 
found except at Ephesus and possibly in south Galatia, though 
there are traces of the office, at any rate in germ, under different 
titles in other churches. (2) In the second stage (between 60 and 
100) there is an increasing tendency towards uniformity. The 
office is found definitely mentioned in connexion with the churches 
of Asia Minor (1 Pet. i. 1), Corinth (Epistle of Clement) and Crete 
(Titus). The officials were called by two names, " elders " and 
" bishops," the former denoting the office, the latter the function 
(exercising the oversight). The substantial identity of the two 
titles cannot be doubted in the light of such passages as Acts xx. 
17, 28.; 1 Pet. v. 1, 2; 1 Tim. iii. 1-7, v. 17-19 and Titus i. 5-7. 

There is far less controversy with regard to the later history 
of the presbyters. The third stage of the development of the 
office is marked by the rise of the single episcopus as the head 
of the individual church (see Bishop; Episcopacy). The first 
trace of this is to be found in the Epistles of Ignatius which 
prove that by the year 115 " the three orders " as they were 
afterwards called — bishop, presbyters and deacons — already 
existed, not indeed universally, but in a large proportion of the 
churches. The presbyters occupied an intermediate position 
between the bishop and the deacons. They constituted " the 
council of the bishop." It was some time before the threefold 
ministry became universal. The Didache knows nothing of the 
presbyters; bishops and deacons are mentioned, but there is no 
reference to the second order. The Shepherd of Hennas knows 
nothing of the single bishop; the churches are under the control 
of a body of presbyter-bishops. Before the close of the 2nd 
century however the three orders were established almost 
everywhere. The sources of the Apostolic Canons (which date 
between 140-180) lay down the rule that even the smallest 
community of Christians, though it contain only twelve mem- 
bers, must have its bishop and its presbyters. The original 
equality of bishops and presbyters was still however theoreti- 
cally maintained. The Canons of Hippolytus which belong to 
the end of the 2nd century distinctly lay it down that " at the 
ordination of a presbyter everything is to be done as in the 
case of a bishop, save that he does not seat himself upon the 
throne. The same prayer shall also be said as for a bishop, the 
name of the bishop only being left out. The presbyter shall in 
all things be equal with the bishop, save in the matter of pre- 
siding and ordaining, for the power to ordain is not given him." 
The presbyters formed the governing body of the church. It 
was their duty to maintain order, exercise discipline, and 
superintend the affairs of the Church. At the beginning of 
the 3rd century, if we are to believe Tertullian, they had no 
spiritual authority of their own, at any rate as far as the sacra- 
ments are concerned. The right to baptize and celebrate the 
communion was delegated to them by the bishop. 5 

In the fourth stage we find the presbyters, like the bishops, 
becoming endowed with special sacerdotal powers and functions. 
Up to the end o£ the 2nd century the universal priesthood 
of all believers was the accepted doctrine of the Church. It was 
not till the middle of the 3rd century that the priesthood was 
restricted to the clergy. Cyprian is largely responsible for the 
change, though traces of it are found during the previous half 
century. Cyprian bestows the highest sacerdotal terms upon 
the bishops of course, but his references to the priestly character 
of the office of presbyter are also most definite. 6 Henceforth pres- 
byters are recognized as the secundum sacerdotium in the Church. 

With the rise of the diocesan bishops the position of the 
presbyters became more important. The charge of the indi- 
vidual church was entrusted to them and gradually they took the 
place of the local bishops of earlier days, so that in the 5th and 
6th centuries an organization was reached which approximated 
in general outline to the system which prevails in the Anglican 
Church to-day.

PRESBYTERIANISM, a highly organized form of church 
government in which presbyters or elders occupy a prominent 
place. As one of the three principal systems of ecclesiastical 
polity known to the Christian Church, Presbyterianism occupies 
an intermediate position between episcopacy' and Congrega- 
tionalism. A brief comparison with these will indicate its 
salient features. In episcopacy the supreme authority is a 
diocesan bishop; in Congregationalism it is the members of the 
congregation assembled in church meeting; in Presbyterianism 
it is a church council composed of representative presbyters. 
In episcopacy the control of church affairs is almost entirely 
withdrawn from the people; in Congregationalism it is almost 
entirely exercised by the people; in Presbyterianism it rests 
with a council composed of duly appointed office-bearers chosen 
by the people. The ecclesiastical unit in episcopacy is a diocese, 
comprising many churches and ruled by a prelate; in Congrega- 
tionalism it is a single church, self-governed and entirely inde- 
pendent of all others; in Presbyterianism it is a presbytery or 
council composed of ministers and elders representing all the 
churches within a specified district. It may be said broadly, 
therefore, that in episcopacy the government is monarchical;, 
in Congregationalism, democratic; and in Presbyterianism, 
aristocratic or representative. 

I. — The System Described 

As compared with the Church of England (Episcopal) in which 

there are three orders of clergy — bishops, priests and deacons, 

rs ^_^ the Presbyterian Church -recognizes but one spiritual 

One Order. , , J , A r™ 1 ■ *• n r 

order, viz. presbyters. These are ecclesiastically of 

equal rank, though differentiated, according to their duties, as 
ministers who preach and administer the sacraments, and as 
elders who are associated with the ministers tn the oversight of 
the people. There are deacons in Presbyterianism inferior in 
rank to presbyters, their duties being regarded as non-spiritual. 
The membership of a Presbyterian Church consists of all 
who are enrolled as communicants, together with their children. 
Member* Others who worship regularly without becoming 
ship. communicants are called adherents. Only com- 

municants exercise the rights of membership. They elect the 
minister and other office-bearers. But, in contrast with Con- 
gregationalism, when they elect and " call " a minister their 
action has to be sustained by the presbytery, which judges of 
his fitness for that particular sphere, of the measure of the 
congregation's unanimity, and of the adequacy of financial 
support. When satisfied, the presbytery proceeds with the 
ordination and induction. The ordination and induction of 
ministers is always the act of a presbytery. The ordination 
and induction of elders in some branches of the Church is the 
act of the kirk-session; in others it is the act of the presbytery. 

The kirk-session is the first of a series of councils or church 
courts which are an essential feature of Presbyterianism. It 
„. . consists of the ministers and ruling elders. The minister 

Session ls ex °^ cio president or moderator. Without his 
• t presence or the presence of his duly-appointed deputy 
the meeting would not be in order nor its proceedings valid. The 
moderator has not a deliberative, but only a casting vote. (This 
is true of the moderator in all the church courts.) Neither the session 
nor the congregation has jurisdiction over the minister. He holds 
his office advitam aut cutpam; he cannot demit it or be deprived 
of it without consent of the presbytery. ^ In this way his inde- 
pendence among the people to whom he ministers is to a large extent 
secured. The kirk-session has oversight of the congregation in 
regard to such matters as the hours of public worship, the arrange- 
ments for administration of the sacraments, the admission of new 
members and the exercise of church discipline. New members 
are either catechumens or members transferred from other churches. 
The former are received after special instruction and profession 
of faith; the latter on presenting a certificate of church membership 
from the church which they have left. Though the admission of 
new members is, strictly speaking, the act of the session, this duty 
usually devolves upon the minister, who reports his procedure to ' 



the session for approval and confirmation. Matters about which 
there is any doubt or difficulty, or division of opinion in the 
session, may be carried for settlement to the next higher court, 
the presbytery. 

Tnc presbytery consists of all the ministers and a selection of 
the ruling ciders from the congregations within a prescribed area. 
The presbytery chooses its moderator periodically from -. 
among its ministerial members. His duty is to see /w s fc WerK 
that business is transacted according to Presbyterian ^ °^ 9 

principle and procedure. The moderator has no special power or 
supremacy over his brethren, but is honoured and obeyed as primus 
inter pares. The work of the presbytery is episcopal. It has 
oversight of all the congregations within its bounds; hears refer- 
ences from kirk-sessions or appeals, from individual members; 
sanctions the formation of new congregations; superintends the 
education of students for the ministry; stimulates and guides 
pastoral and evangelistic^ work; and exercises discipline over all 
within its bounds, including the ministers. Three members, two 
of whom must be ministers, form a quorum; a small number com- 

Cared with the important business they^ may have to transact, 
ut the right of appeal to a higher court is perhaps sufficient safe- 
guard against abuse. Presbytery meetings arc either ordinary 
or occasional. The former are. held at prearranged intervals. 
Occasional meetings are either in hunc effedum or pro re nata. 
The presbytery fixes the former for specific business; the latter is 
summoned by the moderator, either on his own initiative or on the 
requisition of two or more members of presbytery, for the transac- 
tion of business which has suddenly emerged. The first question 
considered at a pro re nata meeting is the action of the moderator 
in calling the meeting. If this is approved the meeting proceeds; 
if not, the meeting is dissolved. Appeals and complaints may be 
taken from the presbytery to the synod. 

The synod is a provincial council which consists of the ministers 
and ^ representative elders from all the congregations within a 
specified number of presbyteries, in the same way as _. „ 
the presbytery is representative of a specified number **w*°a, 
of congregations. Though higher in rank and larger than most 
presbyteries it is practically of less importance, not being, like the 
presbytery, a court of first instance, nor yet, like the general 
assembly, a court of final appeal. The synod at its first meeting 
chooses a minister as its moderator whose duties, though somewhat 
more restricted, are similar to those of presbyterial moderators. 
The synod hears appeals and references from presbyteries; and by 
its discussions and decisions business of various kinds, if not settled, 
is ripened for consideration and final settlement by the general 
assembly, the supreme court of the Church. 

b The general assembly is representative of the whole Church, 
either, as in the Irish General Assembly, by a minister and elder 
sent direct to it from every congregation, or, as in the 
Scottish General Assemblies, by a proportion of dele- TbeOeneml 
gates, ministers and elders from every presbytery. Assemb v* 
The general assembly annually at its first meeting chooses one 
of its ministerial members as moderator. He takes precedence, 
primus inter pares, of all the members, and is recognized as 
the^ official head of the Church during his term of office. His 
position is one of great honour and influence, but he remains a 
simple presbyter, without any special rule or jurisdiction. The 
genera^ assembly reviews all the work of the Church ; settles con- 
troversies; makes administrative laws; directs and stimulates 
missionary and other spiritual work; appoints professors of theology; 
admits to the ministry applicants from other churches; hears and 
decides complaints, references and appeals which have come up 
through the inferior courts; and takes cognizance of all matters 
connected with the Church's interests or with the general welfare 
of the people. As a judicatory it is the final court of appeal; and 
by it alone can the graver censures of church discipline be reviewed 
and removed. The general assembly meets once a year at the 
time and place agreed upon and appointed by its predecessor. 

By means of this series of concihar courts the unity of the Church 
is secured and made manifest; the combined, simultaneous effort 
of the whole is made possible; and disputes, instead of - ... 
being fought out where they arise, are carried for settle- courts, * 
ment to a larger and higher judicatory, free from local 
feeling and prejudice. As access to the church courts is the right 
of all, and involves but slight expense, the liberty of even the 
humblest member of the Church is safeguarded, and local oppression 
or injustice is rendered difficult. 

The weak point in the system is that episcopal superintendence 
being exercised in every case by a plurality of individuals there is 
no one, moderator or senior member, whose special duty it is to take 
initial action when the unpleasant work of judicial investigation 
or ecclesiastical discipline becomes necessary. This has led in some 
quarters to a desire that the moderator should be clothed with 
greater responsibility and have his period of office prolonged; 
should be made, in fact, more of a bishop in the Anglican sense of 
the word. 

Though the jus divinum of presbytery is not now insisted upon 
as in some former times, Presbyterians claim that it is the church 
polity set forth in the New Testament. The case is usually 
stated somewhat as follows. With the sanction and under the

PRESBYTERIANISM 



guidance of the Apostles, officers called elders and deacons were 
appointed in every newly-formed church. 1 They were elected by 
# ew the people, and ordained or set apart for their sacred 

Te&tameat work bv tne Apostles. 2 The elders were appointed to 
Authority, teach and rule; 8 the deacons to minister to the poor. 4 
There were elders in the church at Jerusalem, 6 and in 
the church at Ephesus; 8 Paul and Barnabas appointed elders in the 
cities of Lycaoma and Pisidia; 7 Paul left Titus in Crete to appoint 
elders in every city; 8 the elders amongst the strangers scattered 
throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia re- 
ceived a special exhortation by Peter. 8 These elders were rulers, 
and the only rulers in the New Testament Church. Just as in the 
synagogue there was a plurality of rulers called elders, so there was 
in every Christian church a plurality of elders. The elders were 
different from the deacons, but there is no indication that any one 
elder was of higher rank than the others. The elder was not an 
officer inferior and subordinate to the bishop. The elder was a 
bishop. The two titles are applied to the same persons. See 
Acts xx. 17, 28; " he sent and called for the elders of the church. . . . 
Take heed to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made 
you bishops." See also Titus i. 5, 6: " ordain elders ... for a 
bishop must be blameless." This is now admitted by modern 
expositors. 10 The elders were chosen by the people. This is not 
expressly stated in the New Testament but is regarded as a necessary 
inference. When an apostle was about to be chosen as successor 
to Judas, the people were invited to take part in the election; 11 
and when deacons were about to be appointed the Apostles 
asked the people to make the choice. 12 It is inferred that elders 
were similarly chosen. It is worthy of notice that there is no account 
at all of the first appointment of elders as there is of deacons. 
Probably the recognition and appointment of elders was simply 
the transfer from the synagogue to the Church of a usage which was 
regarded as essential among Jews; and the Gentile churches 
naturally followed the example of the Jewish Christians. 15 The 
elders thus chosen by the people and inducted to their office by the 
Apostles acted as a church court. Only thus could a plurality 
of rulers of equal rank act in an efficient and orderly way. They 
would discharge ^ their pastoral duties as individuals, but when 
a solemn ecclesiastical act, like ordination, was performed, it 
would be done, as in the case of Timothy, by " the laying on of 
the hands of the presbytery "; u and when an authoritative decision 
had to be reached, as in regard to circumcision, a synod or court 
was called together for the purpose. 16 The action of Paul and 
Barnabas at Antioch 16 seems to accord with Presbyterian rather 
than Congregational polity. The latter would have required that 
the question should have been settled by the church at Antioch 
instead of being referred to Jerusalem. And the decision of the 
council at Jerusalem was evidently more than advisory; it was 
authoritative and meant to be binding on all the churches. 17 The 
principle of ministerial parity which is fundamental in Presbyterian- 
lsm is founded not merely on apostolic example but on the words 
of Christ Himself: "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles 
exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise 
authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you." 1S 

From the foregoing outline it will be seen that Presbyterianism 
may be said to consist in the government of the Church by 
representative assemblies composed of the two 
Definhtoas* c l asses oi presbyters, ministers and elders, and so 
arranged as to manifest and realize the visible unity 
of the whole Church. Or it may be described as denying (1) 
that the apostolic office is perpetual and should still exist in the 
Christian Church; (2) that all church power should be vested in 
the clergy; (3) that each congregation should be independent of 
all the rest; and as asserting (1) that the people ought to have 
a substantial part in the government of the Church; (2) that 
presbyters, i.e. elders or bishops, are the highest permanent 
officers in the Church and are of equal rank; (3) that an outward 
and visible Church is one in the sense that a smaller part is 
controlled by a larger and all the parts by the whole. 19

system of church polity as here outlined, and in claiming New

Testament authority for it, there are certain differences of view 
in regard to details which may be noticed. There is no doubt 
that considerable indefiniteness in regard to the 
precise status and rank of the ruling elder is com- y^^ at 
monly prevalent. When ministers and elders are 
associated in the membership of a church court their equality 
is admitted; no such idea as voting by orders is ever entertained. 
Yet even in a church court inequality, generally speaking, is 
visible to the extent that an elder is not usually eligible for the 
moderator's chair. In some other respects also a certain 
disparity is apparent between a minister and his elders. Practi- 
cally the minister is regarded as of higher standing. The duty 
of teaching and of administering the sacraments and of always 
presiding in church courts being strictly reserved to him invests 
his office with a dignity and influence greater than that of the 
elder. It was inevitable, therefore, that this question as to the 
exact status of the ruling elder should claim attention in the 
discussions of the Pan-Presbyterian Alliance. At its meeting 
in Belfast in 1884 a report was submitted by a " committee on 
the eldership " which had been previously appointed. Accord- 
ing to this committee there are prevalent three distinct theories 
in regard to the office and function of ruling elders: — 

I. That while the New Testament recognizes but one order of 
presbyters there are in this order two degrees or classes, known 
as teaching elders and ruling elders. In teaching, in r . . 
dispensing the sacraments, in presiding over public lj! €0 R > f f 
worship, and in the private functions by which he SZ g 
ministers to the comfort, the instruction and the improve- er * 
ment of the people committed to his care, a pastor acts within his 
parish (or congregation) according to his own discretion; and for 
the discharge of all the duties of the pastoral office he is accountable 
only to the presbytery from whom he received the charge of the 
parish (or^ congregation). But in everything which concerns what 
iscallcd discipline — the exercise of that jurisdiction over the people 
with which the office-bearers of the church are conceived to be 
invested, he is assisted by lay-elders. They are laymen in that they 
have no right to teach or to dispense the sacraments, and on this 
account they fill an office in the Presbyterian Church inferior in 
rank and power to that of the pastors. Their peculiar business 
is expressed by the term " ruling elders." 20 

II. A second theory is contended for by Principal Campbell 
in his treatise on the eldership, and by others also, that there is 
no warrant in Scripture for the eldership as it exists in the Presby- 
terian Church ; that the ruling elder is not, and is not designed to 
be, a counterpart of the New Testament elder; in other words, 
that he is not a presbyter, but only a layman chosen to represent 
the laity in the church courts and permitted to assist in the govern- 
ment of the church. 

III. A third theory, advanced by Professor Withcrow and others, 
is that the modern elder is intended to be, and should be, recog- 
nized as a copy of the scriptural presbyter. Those who take this 
view hold that " in everything except training and the conse- 
quences of training the elder is the very same as the minister," 
and they base their opinion on the fact that the terms " overseer " 
or " bishop," " presbyter " and " elder," are used interchangeably 
throughout the New Testament. It is consistent with this view to 
argue the absolute parity of ministers and elders, conceding to all 
presbyters " equal right to teach, to rule, to administer the sacra- 
ments, to take part m the ordination of ministers, and to preside 
in church courts." 

The practice of the Presbyterian churches of the present 
day is in accord with the first-named theory. Where attempts 
are made to reduce the third theory to practice 
the result is not satisfactory. Nor is the first-named p^^jf^ 
theory less in harmony with Scripture teaching than 
the third. In the initial stages of the Apostolic Church it was 
no doubt sufficient to have a plurality of presbyters with abso- 
lutely similar duties and powers. At first, indeed, this may 
have been the only possible course. But apparently it soon 
became desirable and perhaps necessary to specialize the work 
of teaching by setting apart for that duty one presbyter who 
should withdraw from secular occupation and devote his whole 
time to the work of the ministry. There seems to be evidence 
of this in the later writings of the New Testament. 21 It is now 
held by all Presbyterian churches that one presbyter in every 
congregation should have specially committed to him the work

of teaching, administering the sacraments, visiting the flock 
pastorally, and taking oversight, with his fellow elders, of all 
the interests of the church. To share with the minister such 
general oversight is not regarded by intelligent and influential 
laymen as an incongruous or unworthy office; but to identify 
the duties of the eldership, even in theory, with those of the 
minister is a sure way of deterring from accepting office many 
whose counsel and influence in the eldership would be in- 
valuable. 1 

Another subject upon which there is a difference of opinion 
in the Presbyterian churches is the question of Church Establish- 
ments. The view, originally held by all Presbyterian churches 
in Great Britain and on the Continent, that union with and 
support by the civil government arc not only lawful but also 
desirable, is now held only by a minority, and is practically 
exemplified among English-speaking Presbyterians only in 
the Church of Scotland (see Scotland, Church of). The law- 
fulness of Church Establishments with due qualifications is 
perhaps generally recognized in theory, but there is a growing 
tendency to regard connexion with the state as inexpedient, 
if not actually contrary to sound Presbyterian principle. 'That 
this tendency exists cannot be doubted, and there is reason to 
fear that its influence, by identifying Presbyterianism with 
dissent in England and Scotland, is unfavourable to the general 
tone and character of the Presbyterian Church. 

Those who favour state connexion and those who oppose 
it agree in claiming spiritual independence as a fundamental 
principle of Presbyterianism. That principle is 
Spiritual la* e q Ua n v opposed to Erastianism and to Papacy, 
epen e . tQ ^ e c j v jj p 0we r dominating the Church, and to 
the ecclesiastical power dominating the state. All Presby- 
terians admit the supremacy of the state in things secular, and 
they claim supremacy for the Church in things spiritual. Those 
who favour a Church Establishment hold that Church and state 
should each be supreme in its own sphere, and that on these 
terms a union between them is not only lawful but is the highest 
exemplification of Christian statesmanship. So long as these 
two spheres are at all points clearly distinct, and so long as there 
is a desire on the part of each to recognize the supremacy of 
the other, there is little danger of friction or collision. But 
when spiritual and secular interests come into unfriendly contact 
and entanglement; when controversy in regard to them becomes 
inevitable; from which sphere, the spiritual or the civil, is the 
final decision to come? Before the Reformation the Church 
would have had the last word; since that event the right and the 
duty of the civil power have been generally recognized. 

The origin of Presbyterianism is a question of historical 
interest. By some it is said to have begun at the Reformation; 
by some it is traced back to the days of Israel in 
Egypt; 2 by most, however, it is regarded as of later 
Jewish origin, and as having come into existence in its present 
form simultaneously with the formation of the Christian Church. 
The last is Bishop Lightfoot's view. He connects the Christian 
ministry, not with the worship of the Temple, in which were 
priests and sacrificial ritual, but with that of the synagogue, 
which was a local institution providing spiritual edification 
by the reading and exposition of Scripture. 3 The first Christians 
were regarded, even by themselves, as a Jewish sect. They 
were spoken of as "the way." 4 They, took with them, 
into the new communities which they formed, the Jewish 
polity or rule and oversight by elders. The appointment of 
these would be regarded as a matter of course, and would not 
seem to call for any special notice in such a narrative as the 
Acts of the Apostles. 

But Presbyterianism was associated in the 2nd century with a 
kind of episcopacy. This episcopacy was at first rather con- 
gregational than diocesan; but the tendency of its growth was 

undoubtedly towards the latter. Hence for proof that their

church polity is apostolic Presbyterians arc accustomed to 
appeal to the New Testament and to the time when the apostles 
were still living; and for proof of the apostolicity • 

of prelacy Episcopalians appeal rather to the early Bpl-Vopacy^ 
Church fathers and to a time when the last of the 
Apostles had just passed away. 6 It is generally admitted that dis- 
tinct traces of Presbyterian polity are to be found in unexpected 
quarters (e.g. Ireland, Iona, the Culdees, &c.) from the early 
centuries of church history and throughout the medieval 
ages down to the Reformation of the 16th century. Only in 
a very modified sense, therefore, can it be correctly said to date 
from the Reformation. 

At the Reformation the Bible was for the great mass of both 
priests and people a new discovery. The study of it shed floods 
of light upon all church questions. The leaders of the _. 
Reformation searched the New Testament not only for B eforme — 
doctrinal truth but also to ascertain the polity of the 
primitive Church. This was specially true of the Reformers in 
Switzerland, France, Scotland, Holland and in some parts 'of 
Germany. Luther gave little attention to New Testament polity, 
though he believed in and clung passionately to the universal 
priesthood of all true Christians, and rejected the idea of a sacer- 
dotal caste. He had no dream or vision of the Church's spiritual 
independence and prerogative. He was content that ecclesiastical 
supremacy should be with the civil power, and he believed that 
the work of the Reformation would in that way be best preserved 
and furthered. In no sense can his " consistorial " system of 
church government be regarded as Presbyterian. 

It was different with the Reformers outside Germany^ While 
Luther studied the Scriptures in search of true doctrine and 
Christian life and was indifferent to forms of church 
polity, they studied the New Testament not only in Leaders 
search of primitive church doctrine but also of primitive Jf' 
church polity. One is struck by the unanimity with *f 'orwea 
which, working individually and often in lands far apart, UK * 
they reached the same conclusions. They did not get their ideas 
of church polity from one another, but drew it directly from the 
New Testament. For example, John Row, oneof the five commis- 
sioners appointed by the Scottish Privy Council to draw up what 
is now known as the First Book of Discipline, distinctly says that 
44 they took not their example from any kirk in the world; no, 
not from Geneva " ; but they drew their plan from the sacred Scrip- 
tures.* This was true of them all. They were unanimous in 
rejecting the episcopacy of the Church of Rome, the sanctity of 
celibacy, the sacerdotal character of the ministry, the confessional, 
the propitiatory nature of the mass. They were unanimous in 
adopting the idea of a church in which all the members were priests 
undertne Lord Jesus, the One High Priest and Ruler; the officers 
of which were not mediators between men and God, but preachers 
of One Mediator, Christ Jesus; not lords over God's heritage, but 
ensamples to the flock and ministers to render service. They were 
unanimous in rep^arding ministerial service as mainly pastoral; 
preaching, administering the sacraments and visiting from house 
to house; and, further, in perceiving that Christian ministers must 
be also spiritual rulers, not in virtue of any magical influence 
transmitted from the Apostles, but in virtue of their election by the 
Church and of their appointment in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
When the conclusions thus reached by many independent investi- 

fators were at length reduced to a system by Calvin, in his famous 
nstitutio, it became the definite ideal of church government for 
all the Reformed, in contradistinction to the Lutheran, churches. 

Yet we do not find that the leaders of the Reformed Church 
succeeded in establishing at once a fully-developed Presbyterian 
polity. Powerful influences hindered them from realiz- «. ., 
ing their ideal. We notice two. In the first place, the jfjj „ 
people generally dreaded the recurrence of ecclesiastical n rM . * 
tyranny. So dreadful had been the yoke of Rome, which they had 
shaken off, that they feared to submit to anything similar even 
under Protestant auspices. When their ministers, moved by an 
intense desire to keep the Church pure by means of the exercise 
of scriptural discipline, claimed special spiritual rule over the people, 
it was not wonderful that the latter should have been reluctant to 
submit to a new spiritual despotism. So strong was this feeling 
in some places that it was contended that the discipline of ex- 
communication, if exercised at all, should be exercised only by the 
secular power. A second powerful influence was of a different 
kind, viz. municipal jealousy of church power. The municipal 
authority in those times claimed the right to exercise a censorship 
over the citizens' private life. Any attempt on the part of the Church 
to exercise discipline was resented as an intrusion. Ft has been 
a common mistake to think of Calvin and contemporary Reformers

as introducing a discipline of stern repression which made the in- 
nocent gaieties of life impossible, and produced a dull uniformity 
of straitlaced manners and hypocritical morals. The discipline 
was there before the Reformers. There were civil laws which 
regulated clothing, food and social festivity. Hence friction, at 
times, between the Reformers and civic authorities friendly to the 
Reformation; not as to whether there should be "discipline" 
(that was never doubted) but as to whether it should be ecclesi- 
astical or municipal. Even, therefore, where people desired the 
Reformation there were powerful influences opposed to the setting 
up of church government and to the exercise of church discipline 
after the manner of the apostolic Church; and one ceases to wonder 
at the absence of complete Presbyterianism in the countries which 
were forward to embrace and adopt the Reformation. Indeed 
the more favourable the secular authorities were to the Reformation 
the less need was there to discriminate between civil and ecclesi- 
astical power, and to define strictly how the latter should be exer- 
cised. We look in vain, therefore, for much more than the germs 
and principles of Presbyterianism in the churches of the first 
Reformers. Its evolution and the thorough application of its 
principles to actual church life came later, not in Saxony or Switzer- 
land, but in France and Scotland; and through Scotland it has 
passed to all English-speaking lands. 

The doctrines of Presbyterianism are those generally known 

as evangelical and Calvinistic. The supreme standard of 

belief is the Word of God in the original languages. 

eoogy. P pj ie su b or di na te standards have been numerous, 
though marked by striking agreement -in the main body of 
Christian doctrine which they set forth. Much has been done 
of late years to make these subordinate standards of reformed 
doctrine more generally known. The following list is fairly 
complete: — 

Switzerland. — First Helvetic Confession (1536). Geneva Con- 
fession (1536). Geneva Catechism (1545). 

England. — Forty-two Articles (1553)- Thirty-eight Articles (1563). 
Thirty-nine Articles (1571). Lambeth Articles (1595). Irish Articles 
(1615). Westminster Confession (1 644-1 647). Larger and Shorter 
Catechisms (1647). 

France. — Confessio gallicana (1559).

Netherlands Confession (1566).

The form of worship associated with Presbyterianism has 
been marked by extreme simplicity. It consists of reading of 
Presby Holy Scripture, psalmody, non-liturgical prayer 
terian and preaching. There is nothing in the standards 
Worship. f the Presbyterian Church against liturgical worship. 
In some of the early books of order a few forms of prayer were 
given, but their use was not compulsory. On the whole, the 
preponderating preference has always been in favour of so-called 
extemporaneous, or free prayer; and the Westminster Directory 
of Public Worship has to a large extent stereotyped the form 
and order of the service in most Presbyterian churches. Within 
certain broad outlines much, perhaps too much, is left to the 
choice of individual congregations. It used to be customary 
among Presbyterians to stand during public prayer, and to 
remain seated during the acts of praise, but this peculiarity 
is no longer maintained. The psalms rendered into metre 
were formerly the only vehicle of the Church's public praise, 
but hymns are now also used in most Presbyterian churches. 1 
Organs used to be regarded as contrary to New Testament 
example, but their use is now all but universal. The public 
praise used to be led by an individual called the " precentor," 
who occupied a box in front of, and a little lower than, the pulpit. 
Choirs of male and female voices now lead the church praise. 

Presbyterianism has two sacraments, baptism and the Lord's 
Supper. Baptism is administered both to infants and adults by 

c . m pouring or sprinkling, but the mode is considered

imitation' of the New Testament practice ; and where it is not marred 
by undue prolixity commends itself to most Christian people as 
a solemn and impressive service. The old plan of coming out 
and taking one's place at the communion table in the body of the 
church is unhappily seen no more; communicants now receive the 
sacred elements seated in their pews. The dispensing of this rite 
is strictly reserved to an ordained minister, who is assisted by elders 
in handing the bread and the cup to the people. The administra- 
tion of private communion to the sick and dying is extremely rare 
in Presbyterian churches, but there is less objection to it than 
formerly, and in some churches it is even encouraged. 

Presbyterian discipline is now entirely confined to exclusion from 
membership or from office. Though it is the duty of a minister 
to warn against irreverent or profane participation in -y . „ 
the Lord's Supper, he himself has no right to exclude scp ne 
any one from communion; that can only be done as the act of 
himself and the elders duly assembled in session. A code of in- 
structions for the guidance of church courts when engaged in 
cases of discipline is in general use, and bears witness to the extreme 
care taken not only to have things done decently and in order, 
but also to prevent hasty, impulsive and illogical procedure in the 
investigation of charges of heresy or immorality. Cases of dis- 
cipline are now comparatively rare, and, when they do occur, 
are not characterized by the bigoted severity which prevailed in 
former times and was rightly denounced as unchristian. 

The extent to which the Presbyterian form of church govern- 
ment prevails throughout the world has been made more manifest 
in recent years by the formation of a " General 



General 
Statistics, 



Council of the Alliance of Reformed Churches 
holding the Presbyterian System." At a representa- 
tive conference in London in 1875 the constitution of the council 
was agreed upon. The first council met in Edinburgh in 1877. 
Since then it has met in Philadelphia, Belfast, London, Toronto, 
Glasgow, Washington and Liverpool. Churches which are 
organized on Presbyterian principles and hold doctrines in 
harmony with the reformed confessions are eligible for admis- 
sion to the alliance. The object is not to form one great 
Presbyterian organization, but to promote unity and fellowship 
among the numerous branches of Presbyterianism throughout 
the world. On the roll of the general council held at Washington 
in 1899 there were sixty-four churches. The statistics of 
these and of sixteen others not formally in the alliance 
were 29,476 congregations, 26,251 ministers, 126,607 elders 
and 4,852,096 communicants. Of these eighty churches, 
twelve were in the United Kingdom, twenty on the conti- 
nent of Europe, sixteen in North America, three in South 
America, ten in Asia, nine in Africa, six in Australia, two 
in New Zealand, one in Jamaica and one in Melanesia. 
The desire for union which led to the formation of the 
alliance has, since 1875, borne remarkable fruit. In England 
in 1876 two churches united to form the Presbyterian 
Church of England; in the Netherlands two churches be- 
came one in 1892; in South Africa a union of the different 
branches of the Presbyterian Church took place in 1897; 
in Scotland the Free Church and the United Presbyterian 
became one in 1900 under the designation of the United Free 
Church; in Australia and Tasmania six churches united in 
1 901 to form the Presbyterian Church of Australia; and a few 
months later the two churches in New Zealand which represented 
respectively the North and South Islands united to form the 
Presbyterian Church of New Zealand. "In no portion of the 
empire," it has been said, " does the British flag now fly 
over a divided Presbyterianism, except in the British Isles 
themselves." 

II.— History in Different Countries 
From this general outline of Presbyterianism we now turn 
to consider its evolution and history in some of the countries 
with which it is or has been specially associated. We omit, 
however, one of the most important, viz. Scotland, as the history 
is fully covered under the separate headings of Scotland, 
Church of, and allied articles. 

Switzerland. # 

The Swiss, owing to their peculiar geographical position and 
to certain political circumstances, early manifested indepen- 
dence in ecclesiastical matters, and became accustomed' to the

management of their church affairs. The work of Zwingli as 
a Reformer, important and thorough though it was, did not con- 
cern itself mainly with church polity. Ecclesiastical affairs were, 
as a matter of course, wholly under the management of the 
cantonal and municipal authorities, and Zwingli was content that 
it should be so. The work of Farel, previous to his coming to 
Geneva, was almost entirely evangelistic, and his first work in 
Geneva was of a similar character. It was the town council 
which made arrangements for religious disputations, and pro- 
vided for the housing and maintenance of the preachers. When 
Calvin* Calvin, at Farel's invitation, settled in Geneva (1536) 
the work of reformation became more constructive. 
" The need of the hour was organization and familiar instruction, 
and Calvin set himself to work at once." The first reforms he 
wished to see introduced concerned the Lord's Supper, church 
praise, religious instruction of youth and the regulation of 
marriage. In connexion with the first he desired that the 
discipline de V excommunication should be exercised. His plan 
was partly Presbyterian and partly consistorial. Owing to 
certain circumstances in its past history, Geneva was notoriously 
immoral. " The rule of dissolute bishops, and the example of 
a turbulent and immoral clergy, had poisoned the morals of 
the city. Even the nuns of Geneva were notorious for their 
conduct." 1 Calvin suggested that men of known worth should 
be appointed in different quarters of the city to report to the 
ministers those persons in their district who lived in open sin; 
that the ministers should then warn such persons not to come to 
the communion; and that, if their warnings were unheeded, 
discipline should be enforced. It was on this subject of keeping 
pure the Lord's Table that the controversy arose between the 
ministers and the town councillors which ended in the banish- 
ment of Calvin, Farel and Conrad from Geneva. In 1538 the 
ministers took upon themselves to refuse to administer the 
Lord's Supper in Geneva because the city, as represented 
by its council, declined to submit to church discipline. The 
storm then broke out, and the ministers were banished 

(1538). 

It may be convenient at this point to consider Calvin's ideal 
church polity, as set^ forth in his famous Chrtstianae religionis 
institution the first edition of which was published in 1536. Briefly 
it was as follows: — 

A separate ministry is an ordinance of God (Inst. iv. 3, i. 3). 

Ministers duly called and ordained may alone preach and ad- 
minister the sacraments (iv. 3, 10). 

A legitimate ministry is one appointed with the consent and 
approbation of the people under the presidency of other 
pastors by whom the final act of ordination (with laying on 
of hands) shall be performed (iv. 3, 15). 

Governors or persons ot advanced^ years selected from the people 
and associated with the ministers in admonishing and 
exercising discipline (iv. 3, 8). This discipline is all-important, 
and is the special business of the governors. 
His system, while preserving the democratic theory by recognizing 
the congregation # as holding the church power, was in practice 
strictly aristocratic inasmuch as the congregation is never allowed 
any direct use of power, which is invested in the whole body of elders. 
His great object was discipline. With regard to the relations 
between the Church and the civil power, Calvin was opposed to the 
Zwinglian theory whereby all ecclesiastical power was handed 
over to the state. Calvin's refusal to administer the sacrament, 
for which he was banished from Geneva, is important as a matter 
of ecclesiastical history, because it is the essence of the whole 
system which he subsequently introduced. It rests on the prin- 
ciples that the Church has the right to exclude those who are un- 
worthy, and that she is in no way subject to the civil power in 
spiritual matters. During the three years of his banishment 
Calvin was at Strassburg, where he had been carrying out his ideas. 
His recall was greatly to his honour. The town had become a 
prey to anarchy. One party threatened to return to Romanism; 
another threatened to sacrifice the independence of Geneva and 
submit to Berne. It was felt to be a political necessity that he should 
return, and in 1541, somewhat reluctantly, he returned on his own 
terms. These were the recognition of the Church's spiritual inde- 
pendence, the division of the town into parishes, and the appoint- 
ment (by the municipal authority) of a consistory or council of 
elders in each parish for the exercise of discipline. 

These terms were embodied in the famous Ordonnanees ecclesi- 
astiqucs de Viglise de Geneve (1541)- The four orders mentioned 

1 Lindsay, Hist, of the Reform, ii. 90. 



in the Institutio are recognized: pastors, doctors, elders and deacons. 
The pastors were to preach, administer the sacraments, and in 
conjunction with the elders to exercise discipline. In their totality 
they form the vSnirable compagnie. A newly- made pastor was to 
be settled in a fixed charge by the magistrate with the consent of 
the congregation, after having been approved as to knowledge 
and manner of life by the pastors already in office. By them he 
was to be ordained, after vowing to be true in office, faithful to 
the church system, obedient to the laws and to the civil govern- 
ment, and ready to exercise discipline without fear or favour. 
The doctors were to teach the faithful in sound learning, to guard 
purity of doctrine, and to be amenable to discipline. The elders 
(Anctens, commis t ou deputez par la seigneurie ou consistoire) 
were regarded as the essential part of the system. They were the 
bond of union between Church and state. Their business was to 
supervise daily life, to warn the disorderly, and to give notice 
to the consistory of cases requiring discipline. To form the. 
consistory all the elders with the ministers were to meet every 
Sunday under the presidency of one of the syndics or magistrates. 
This court could award censures up to exclusion from the 
sacrament. 

Manifestly the arrangement was a compromise. The state 
retained control of the ecclesiastical organization, and Calvin 
secured his much-needed system of discipline. Fourteen years of 
friction and struggle followed, and if there came after them 
a period of comparative triumph and repose for the great reformer 
it must still be remembered that he was never able to have his 
ideal ecclesiastical organization fully realized in the city of his 
adoption. 

The early Presbyterianism of Switzerland was defective in the 
following respects: (1) It started from a wrong definition of the 
Church, ^ which, instead^ of being conceived as an organized 
community of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, was made to 
depend upon the preaching of the gospel and the administration 
of the^ sacraments. As these implied a duly appointed minister, 
the existence of the Church was made to depend upon an organized 
ministry rather than an organized membership. It calls to mind 
the Romish formula: "Ubt episcopus ibi ecclesia." (2) It did 
not maintain the scriptural right of the people to choose their 
minister and other office-bearers. (3) Its independence of civil 
control was very imperfect. (4) And it did not by means of church 
courts provide for the manifestation of the Church's unity and for 
the concentration of the Church's influence. 

" Calvin," says Principal Lindsay, " did three things for Geneva 
all oi which went far beyond its walls. He gave its Church a 
trained ministry, its homes an educated people who could give a 
reason for their faith, and the whole city an heroic soul which 
enabled the little town to stand forth as the citadel and city of 
refuge for the oppressed Protestants of Europe/' 1 

France. 

It is pathetic and yet inspiring to study the development 
of Presbyterianism in France; pathetic because it was in a 
time of fierce persecution that the French Protestants organized 
themselves into churches, and inspiring, because it showed the 
power which scriptural organization gave them to withstand 
incessant, unrelenting hostib'ty. It would be difficult to exag- 
gerate the influence of Calvin upon French Protest- 
antism. His Chrtstianae religionis institutio became infiu^oce, 
a standard round which his countrymen rallied in 
the work and battle of the Reformation. Though under thirty 
years of age, he became all over Europe, and in an exceptional 
degree in France, the leader, organizer and consolidator of the 
Reformation. The work which the young Frenchman did for 
his countrymen was immense. 8 

The year 1555 may be taken as the date when French Protestant- 
ism began to be organized. A few churches had been organized 
earlier, at Meaux in 1546 and at Nimes in 1547, but 
their members had been dispersed by persecution. (7*? , 
Prior to 1555 the Protestants of France had been f or j7°"«*'»- 
the most part solitary Bible students or little companies m * 
meeting together for worship without any organization. But in 
that year the following incident was the beginning of a great 
movement. A small company had been accustomed to meet in 
the lodging of the sieur de la Ferridre in Paris near the Pr6-aux- 
Clercs. At one of the meetings the father of a newly-born child 
explained that he could not go outside France to seek a pure baptism * 
and that his conscience would not permit his child to be baptized 
according to the rites of the Romish Church. After prayer the 
company constituted themselves into a church: chose jean le 
Macon to be their minister, and others of their number to be elders 
and deacons. It seemed as if all France had been waiting for this 
event as a signal, for organized churches began to spring up every -

where immediately afterwards. Within two years Meaux, Poitiers, 
Angers, les Ties de Saintonge, Agen, Bourges, Issoudun, Aubigny, 
Blois, Tours, Lyon, Orleans and Rouen were organized. Thirty- 
six more were completely organized by 1560. 1 According to Beza 
there were about this time 2150 organized churches. A few years 
later Cardinal St Croix reckoned that the Huguenots were one 
half of the population. One hundred and twenty-seven pastors 
had been sent to France from Geneva before 1567. 

In 1558 a further stage in the development of Presbyterian 
church polity was reached. Some doctrinal differences having 
First arisen in the church at Poitiers, Antoine de Chandieu, 

General minister at Paris, went to compose them, and, as the 
Synod* result of a conference, a synod was convened to meet 
in Paris the following year (1559). It was the first 
general synod of the French Protestant Church, and consisted of 
representatives from, some say sixty-six, others, twelve churches. 
It adopted a confession of faith and a book of order or discipline. 
The confession consisted of forty articles. It was based on a short 
confession drafted by Calvin in 1557, and may still be regarded, 
though once or twice revised, as the confession of the French 
Protestant Church. The book of order, Discipline ecclesiastique 
des eglises reformSes de France, regulated the organization and pro- 
cedure of the churches. It contains this fundamental statement 
of Presbyterian parity, " Aucune eglise ne pourra pretendre primaute 
ni domination sur Tautre; ni pareillement, les ministres d'une 
eglise les uns sur les autres; ni les anciens ou diacres, les uns sur 
les autres." The various church courts, familiar to us now as 
Presbyterian, are explained. The consistoire or session consisted 
of the minister, elders and deacons (the latter without a vote), 
and was over the congregation. ^ The colloque or presbytery was 
composed of representative ministers and elders (anciens) from a 
group of congregations. ^ Next in order was the provincial synod 
which consisted of a minister and an elder or deacon from each 
church in the province. Over all was the general or national 
synod. Some of the arrangements are worthy of notice. When 
a church was first formed the office bearers were elected by the 
people, but there the power of the congregation ceased. Future 
vacancies in the eldership were filled up by the office-bearers. 
The eldership was not for life, but there was always a tendency to 
make it so. When the ministry of a church became vacant the 
choice of a successor rested with the colloque or with the provincial 
synod. The people, however, might object, and if their objection 
was considered valid redress was given. Later the synod of 
Nimes (1572) decreed that no minister might be^ imposed upon an 
unwilling people. Deacons, in addition to having charge of the 
poor and sick, might catechize, and occasionally offer public prayer 
or read a written sermon. The president or moderator of each 
church court was primus inter pares. The remarkable feature of 
French church polity was its aristocratic nature, which it owed 
to the system of co-optation ; and the exclusion of the congregation 
from direct and frequent interference in spiritual matters prevented 
many evils which result from too much intermeddling ,on the 
part of the laity. Up to 1565 the national synod consisted of a 
minister with one or two elders or deacons from every church; 
after that date, to avoid overcrowding, its numbers were restricted 
to representatives from each provincial synod. On questions of 
discipline elders and deacons might vote; on doctrinal questions 
only as many of these as there were ministers. 

It is interesting to see how in a country whose civil rule was 
becoming gradually more absolutist, this ' Church under the cross * 
framed for itself a government which reconciled, more thoroughly 
perhaps than has ever been done since, the two principles of popular 
rights and supreme control. Its constitution has spread to Holland, 
Scotland (Ireland, England), and to the great American (and 
Colonial) churches. Their ecclesiastical polity came much more 
from Paris than from Geneva." 2 

To trace the history of Presbyterianism in France for the next 
thirty years would be to write the history of France itself during 
that period. We should have to tell of the great and rapid 
increase of the Church ; of its powerful influence among the nobles 
atld the bourgeoisie; of its direful persecutions ; of its St Bartholomew 
massacre with 70,000 victims; of its regrettable though perhaps 
inevitable entanglements in politics and war; and finally of its 
attaining not only tolerance but also honourable recognition and 
protection when Henry IV. in 1598 signed the famous edict of 
Nantes. This secured complete liberty of conscience everywhere 
within the realm and the free right of public worship in all places 
in which it existed during the years 1596 and 1597, or where it 
had been granted by the edict of Poitiers (1577) interpreted by the 
convention of Nerac (1578) and the treaty of Fleix (1580) — in all 
some two hundred towns; in two places in every bailliage and 
sinechaussie ; in the castles of Protestant seigneurs hauls justiciers 
(some three thousand); and in the houses of lesser nobles, pro- 
vided the audience did not consist of more than thirty persons 
over and above relations of the family. Protestants were granted 
full civil rights and protection^ and were permitted to hold their 
ecclesiastical assemblies — consistories, colloquies and synods,

national and provincial. Under the protection of the edict the 
Huguenot Church of France flourished. Theological colleges were 
established at Sedan, Montauban and Saumur, and French theo- 
logy became a counterpoise to the narrow Reformed scholastic of 
Switzerland and Holland.' 

The history of the Church from the passing of the edict of Nantes 
till its revocation in 1685 cannot be given here. That event was 
the climax of a long series of horrors. Under the persecution, a 
large number were killed, and between four and five millions of Pro- 
testants left the country. Early in the 18th century Antoine Court 
made marvellous efforts to restore Presbyterianism. In momentary 
peril of death for fifteen years, he restored in the Vivarais and the 
Cevennes Presbyterian church polity in all its integrity. In 1715 
he assembled his first colloque. Synods were held in 17 18, 1723, 
1726 and 1727; and in a remote spot in Bas Languedoc in 1744 a 
national synod assembled — the first since 1660 — which consisted 
of representatives from every province formerly Protestant. 

From 1760 owing to the gradual spread of the sceptical spirit 
and the teaching of Voltaire more tolerant views prevailed. In 
1787 the Edict of Tolerance was published. In 1789 all citizens 
were made equal before the law, and the position of Presbyterianism 
improved till 1791. In 1801 and 1802 Napoleon took into his own 
hands the independence of both Catholic and Protestant Churches, the 
national synod was abolished, and all active religious propaganda 
was rigorously forbidden. In 1848 an assembly representative 
of the eglises consistoriales met at Paris. When it refused to discuss 
points of doctrine a secession took place under the name of the 
Union des iglises Svangeliques de France. This society held a synod 
at which a confession of faith and a book of order were drawn up. 
Meanwhile the national Protestant Church set itself to the work 
of reconstruction on the basis of universal suffrage, with restrictions, 
but no result was arrived at. In 1852 a change took place in its 
constitution. The iglises consistoriales were abolished, and in each 
parish a presbyterial council was appointed, the minister being 
president, with four to seven elders chosen by the people. In the 
large towns there were consistories composed of all the ministers 
and of delegates from the various parishes. Over all was the 
central provincial council consisting of the two senior ministers 
and fifteen members nominated by the state in the first instance. 
In 1858 there were 617 pastors and the Union des eglises Svangeliques 
numbered 27 churches. 

The Netherlands. 
From the geographical position of the Netherlands, Pres- 
byterianism there took its tone from France. In 1562 the 
Confessto belgka was publicly acknowledged, and in 1563 
the church order was arranged. In 1574 the first provincial 
synod of Holland and Zealand was held, but William of Orange 
would not allow any action to be taken independently of the 
state. The Reformed churches had established themselves in 
independence of the state when that state was Catholic; when 
the government became Protestant the Church had protection 
and at the same time became dependent. It ' was a state 
church. By the union of Utrecht the communes and provinces 
had each the regulation of its own religion; hence constant 
conflict. In most cases it was insisted on as necessary that 
church discipline should remain with the civil authority. In 
1576 William, with the support of Holland, Zeeland and their 
allies, put forth forty articles, by which doctors, elders and 
deacons were recognized, and church discipline given to the 
elders, subject to appeal to the magistrate and by which the 
Church was placed in absolute dependence on the state. These 
articles, however, never came into operation; and the decisions 
of the synod of Dort in 1 5 78, which made the Church independent 
were equally fruitless. In 1581 the Middelburg Synod divided 
the Church, created provincial synods and presbyteries, but 
could not shake off the civil power in connexion with the choice 
of church officers. Thus, although the congregations were 
Presbyterian, the civil government retained overwhelming 
influence. The Leiden magistrates said in 1581 : " If we accept 
everything determined upon in the synod, we shall end by being 
vassals of the synod. We will not open to churchmen a door 
for a new mastership over government and subjects, wife and 
child." From 1618 a modified Presbyterian polity predom- 
inated. As a rule elders held office for only two years. The 
" kerk-raad " (kirk-session) met weekly, the magistrate being 
a member ex officio. The colloque consisted of one minister 
and one elder from each congregation. At the annual provincial 
synod, held by consent of the states, two ministers and one

elder attended from each colloque. Every congregation was 
visited by ministers appointed by. the provincial synod. In 
1795, of course, everything was upset, and it was not until after 
the restoration of the Netherland States that a new organization 
was formed in 181 6. Its main features were strictly Presby- 
terian, but the minister was greatly superior to the elder, and 
the state had wide powers especially in the nomination of higher 
officers. In 1851 the system now in force was adopted. The 
congregation chooses all the officers, and these form a church 
council. 

England. 
Presbyterian principles and ideas were entertained by many 
of the leading ecclesiastics in England during the reign of 
Edward VI. Even the archbishop of Canterbury favoured a 
modification of episcopacy, and an approach to Presbyterian 
polity and diciplinc; but attention was mainly directed to the 
settlement of doctrine and worship. Cranmcr wrote that 
bishops and priests were not different but the same in the 
beginning of Christ's religion. Thirteen bishops subscribed 
this proposition: that in the New Testament there is no mention 
made of any distinctions or degrees in orders but only deacons 
and priests or bishops. Cranmer held that the consecration of 
a bishop was an unnecessary rite, and not required by Scripture; 
that election and appointment to office were sufficient. The 
bishop of St Davids was of the same opinion. Latimer and 
Hooper maintained that Bishops and presbyters were identical; 
and Pilkington, bishop of Durham, and Bishop Jewel were of 
the same mind. The latter, about the time of Elizabeth's 
succession, expressed his hope that the bishops would become 
pastors, labourers and watchmen; and that the great riches of 
bishoprics would be diminished and reduced to mediocrity; that, 
being delivered from courtly and regal pomp, the bishops might 
take care of the flock of Christ. During the reign of Edward, 
the title of superintendent was often adopted instead of bishop, 
and it will be recollected that John Knox was an honoured 
worker in England with the title of superintendent during this 
reign. As an indication of sympathy with Presbyterianism, 
it may be noted that Cranmer favoured a proposal for the 
formation of a council of presbyters in each diocese, and for 
provincial synods. 

During 1567 and 1568 the persecutions in France and Holland 
drove thousands of Protestants, mostly Presbyterians, to England. 
In 1570 Presbyterian views found a distinguished exponent in 
Dr Thomas Cartwright at Cambridge; and the temper of parliament 
was shown by the act of 1571, for the reform of disorders in the 
Church, in which" while all mention of doctrine is omitted, the 
doctrinal articles alone being sanctioned, ordination without 
a bishop is implicitly recognized. In 1572 a formal manifesto 
was^ published, entitled an Admonition Jo Parliament, the 
leading ideas in which were: parity of ministers, appointment 
of elders and_ deacons; election of ministers by the congre- 
gation; objection to prescribed prayer and antiphonal chant- 
ing; preaching, the chief duty of a minister; and the power 
of the magistrates to root out superstition and idolatry. On 
Presbytery t * ie 20tn °* November 1572 the authors of the " Ad- 
0/ WaadS' mom "tion " set up at Wandsworth what has been 
worth. called the first presbytery in England. They adopted 
a purely Presbyterian system which was published as 
the Orders of Wandsworth. Similar associations or presbyteries 
were formed in London and in the midland and eastern counties; 
but the privy council was hostile. Only in Jersey and Guernsey, 
whither large numbers of Huguenots had fled after the St Bartholo- 
mew massacre, was Presbyterianism fully permitted. Cartwright 
and Edmund Snape were ministers there; and from 1576 to 1625 
a completely appointed Presbyterian Church existed, under the rule 
of synods, and authorized by the governor. The action of the 
Commons in 15&1, stimulated by the opposition of the Lords, showed 
that the principles of Presbyterianism were strongly held. Bills 
were introduced to reduce the position of a bishop to well-nigh 
that of primus inter pares; to place the power of veto in the con- 
gregation; to abolish the canon law and to establish a presbytery 
in every parish. These proposals were rendered abortive by the 
unflinching use of the queen's prerogative. 

In 1640 Henderson, Baillie, Blair and Gillespie came to London 
as commissioners from the General Assembly in Scotland, in 
response to a request from ministers in London who desired to 
see the Church of England more closely modelled after the 
Reformed type. They were able men, whose preaching drew 
great crowds, and increased the desire for the establishment of 
xxn. 10 



Presbyterianism. In 1642 the Long Parliament abolished Episcopacy 
(the act to come into force on the §th of November -. w t 
1643); and summoned an assembly of divines to meet ° ias 7 er 
at Westminster in June 1643 to advise parliament , w 
as to the new form of Church government. The West- 
minster Assembly, through its Confession, Directory and Catechisms, 
has become so associated with the Presbyterian Church that it is 
difficult to realize that it was not a church court at all, much less 
a creation of Presbyterianism. 

It was a council created by parliament to give advice in church 
matters at a great crisis in the nation's history; but its acts, though 
from the high character and great learning of its members worthy 
of deepest respect, did not per se bind parliament or indeed any- 
one. It was, in a very real sense, representative of the whole 
country, as two members were chosen "by parliament from each 
county. The number summoned was 151, viz. ten lords, twenty 
membersof the House of Commons, and one hundred and twenty- 
one ministers. The ministers were mostly Puritans; by their 
ordination, &c, Episcopalian; and for the most part strongly 
impressed with the desirability of nearer agreement with the Church 
of Scotland, and other branches of the Reformed Church on the 
Continent. About one-half of the members attended regularly. 
Those who were out-and-out Episcopalians did not attend at all. 
Apart from these, there were three well-defined parties: (1) those 
with Presbyterian ideas and sympathies, a great majority; (2) 
Erastians, ably represented and led by Selden, Lightfoot and Cole- 
man; (3) Independents, ten or eleven in number, led by Philip 
Nye, and assured of Cromwell's support. Then there were the Scot- 
tish commissioners who, though without votesj took a leading 
part in the proceedings. Judged by the objects for which it was 
summoned the Westminster Assembly was a failure, a remarkable 
failure. Episcopacy, Erastianism and Independency, though of 
little account in the assembly, were to bulk largely in England's 
future; while the church polity which the assembly favoured and 
recommended was to be almost unknown. Judged in other ways, 
however, the influence of the assembly's labours has been very 
great. The Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Cate- 
chisms are recognized and venerated standards in all the lands 
where British rrcsbvterianism, with its sturdy characteristics, 
has taken root. And the Directory of Public Worship has shaped 
and coloured, perhaps too thoroughly, the ritual and atmosphere 
of every group of Protestant Anglo-Saxon worshippers throughout 
the world, except Episcopalians. 

In June 1646 the ordinance establishing presbyteries was ratified 
by both houses of parliament, and a few days afterwards it was 
ordered to be put into execution. Twelve presbyteries were 
erected in London; Shropshire and Lancashire were organized; 
and Bolton was so vigorous in the cause as to gain the name of the 
Gene /a of Lancashire. But the system never took root. Not 
only were there well-known adverse influences, but the soil seems 
to have been uncongenial. As compared with Scotland, English 
Presbyterianism had more of the lay element. In every chassis 
or presbytery there were two elders to each minister. The Synod 
of London met half-yearly from 1647 till 1655. Synods 
also were held in the north. But during the Common- Synod of 
wealth Independency gained ground. Then with the Loaa ° a * 
Restoration came Episcopacy, and the persecution of all who were 
not Episcopalians; and the dream and vision of a truly Reformed 
English Church practically passed away. 

After the Revolution and during the reign of William and Mary 
the hatred of the Church of England to the Presbyterians and 
other dissenters had been obliged to lie dormant. Decadence 
With the accession of Anne, however, began an attempt 
apparently to make up for lost time. From the beginning of the 
1 8th century the greater number of the Presbyterian congregations 
became practically independent in polity and Unitarian in doctrine. 
Indigenous Presbyterianism became almost unknown. _ The 
Presbyterianism now visible in England is of Scottish origin and 
Scottish type, and beyond the fact of embracing a few congregations 
which date from, or* before, the Act of Uniformity and the Five 
Mile Act, has little in common with the Presbyterianism which was 
-for a brief period by law established. 

In 1876 the union of the Presbyterian Church in England with 
the English congregations of the United Presbyterian Church of 
Scotland gathered all English Presbyterians (with uaiontn 
some exceptions) into one church, " The Presbyterian 1876 
Church of England." " What kept these bodies apart 
was their separate historic origin and development, but especially 
the alienation caused by the ' Voluntary Controversy ' which had 
its roots in the difficult problems of civil law in its relation to religion, 
and the stumbling-block of the civil magistrate's authority in 
relation to the Christian conscience." 1 Since the unionthe growth 
of the Church has been considerable. Presbyterianism is compara- 
tively strong in three districts of England, namely Northumberland, 
Lancashire and London. Elsewhere it is either weak or non- 
existent. Even where it is comparatively strong it is largely 
exotic. The membership is mainly Scottish, and the ministers

PRESBYTERIANISM 






have been imported principally from Scotland. To English 
people, therefore, the Presbyterian is still the "Scotch^ Church," 
and they are as a whole slow to connect themselves with it. Efforts 
have been made to counteract this feeling by making the Church 
more distinctly English. The danger in this direction is that when 
Presbyterianism has been modified far enough to suit the English 
taste it may be found less acceptable to its more stalwart sup- 
porters from beyond the Tweed. Following the lead of the Inde- 
pendents, who set up Mansfield College at Oxford, the Presby- 
terian Church has founded Westminster College at Cambridge 
as a substitute for its Theological Hall in London. It was opened 
in 1899 with the view of securing a home-bred ministry more 
conversant with English academic life and thought. 

In common with the general Presbyterianism of the British Isles, 
the Presbyterian Church of England has in recent years been 
readjusting its relation to the Westminster Confession of Faith. 
Without setting aside the Cqnfession as the church's standard, 
twenty-four " Articles of the Faith " have been adopted. In these 
no change, it is alleged, has been made in regard to the substance 
of the Westminster doctrine, but there is an alteration of emphasis 
and proportion. 

There are in England fourteen congregations in connexion with 
the Church of Scotland, six of them in London and the remainder 
in Berwick, Northumberland, Carlisle and Lancashire. 

Many Unitarians in England still call themselves Presbyterians. 
This, except historically, is a misnomer, for, though descended 
from the old English Presbyterians, they retain nothing of their 
distinctive doctrine or polity — nothing of Presbyterianism, indeed, 
but the name. 

Ireland. 

Presbyterianism in Ireland, in modern times at least, dates 
from the plantation of Ulster in the reign of James I. The 
infusion of a considerable Scottish element into the population 
necessitated the formation of a congenial church.' The immi- 
grants from England took with them, in like manner, their 
attachment to the Episcopal Church. But these two sections 
of Protestantism, in their common exile and in presence of the 
preponderating Roman Catholicism of the country, seemed at 
first inclined to draw closer together than had been thought 
possible in Great Britain. A confession of faith, drawn up by 
Archbishop Usher at the convocation of 1615, implicitly ad- 
mitted the validity of Presbyterian ordination, and denied the 
distinction between bishop and presbyter. Within the Episcopal 
Church and supported by its endowments, Robert Blair, 
John Livingstone and other ministers maintained a Scottish 
Presbyterian communion. 

From 1625 to 1638 the history of Irish Presbyterians is one of 
bare existence. Their ministers, silenced by Wentworth, after an 
ineffectual attempt to reach New England, fled to Scotland, and 
there took a leading part in the great movement of 1638. After 
the Irish rebellion of 1641 the Protestant interest for a time was 
ruined. A majority of the Ulster Protestants were Presbyterians, 
and in a great religious revival which took place the ministers 
of the Scottish regiments stationed in Ireland took a leading part. 
Kirk-sessions were formed in four regiments, and the first regular 
Th Firxt P resD y ter y was ne ld a * Carrickfergus on the 10th of 
Pr^hvt J une 1 ^4^' attended by five ministers and by ruling 
y e/y * elders from the regimental sessions. This presbytery 
supplied ministers to as many congregations as possible; and for 
the remainder ministers were sent from Scotland. By the end of 
1643 the Ulster Church was fairly established. Notwithstanding 
intervening reverses there were by 1647 nearly thirty ordained 
ministers in fixed charges in Ulster besides the chaplains of the 
Scottish regiments. 

At the Restoration, in which they heartily co-operated-, there 
were in Ulster seventy ministers in fixed charges, with nearly 
eighty parishes or congregations containing one hundred thousand, 
persons. There were five presbyteries holding monthly meetings* 
and annual visitations of all the congregations within their bounds, 
and coming together in general synod four times a year. Entire 
conformity with the Scottish Church was maintained, and strict 
discipline was enforced by pastoral visitations, kirk-sessions and 
presbyteries. 

After the Restoration the determination of the government to 
put down Presbyterianism was speedily felt in Ireland. In 1661 
the lords justices forbade all unlawful assemblies/ and in these 
they included meetings of presbytery as exercising ecclesiastical 
jurisdiction not warranted by the law. Bishop Jeremy Taylor 
was forward in this work of persecution. The ministers refused 
to take the Oath of Supremacy without the qualification suggested 
by Usher. Their parishes were declared vacant, and episcopal 
clergy appointed to them. The ejected ministers were forbidden 
to preach or administer the sacraments. In Ulster sixty-one 
ministers were ejected. Of seventy only seven conformed. Under 
Ormonde, in 1665, ministers were again permitted to revive 



Presbyterian worship and discipline, and for several years the Church 
prospered not only in Ulster but also in the south and west. In 
1672 she received a yearly grant from Charles II. of £600 (regium 
donum), and under William III. the amount was considerably 
increased. It was continued till 1869. 

In 1679 the rising in Scotland which ended in the battle of Both- 
welj Bridge brought trouble on the Irish Presbyterians in spite of 
their loyal addresses disowning it. It was not, however, till 1682 
that they again lost the privilege of public ministry, and suffered 
severe oppression. They were opposed to James II., though they 
had benefited by his Declaration of Indulgence, and they were 
the first to congratulate the Prince of Orange on his arrival in 
England. The heroic defence of Londonderry owed much to them, 
as^ they were a majority of the population, and some of their 
ministers rendered conspicuous service. There were then in Ireland 
about a hundred congregations, seventy-five with settled ministers, 
under five presbyteries. Their preponderance in Ulster and their 
consciousness of their great service to England led them first of 
all to hope that Presbyterianism might be substituted for Episcopacy 
in Ulster, and afterwards, that it might be placed on an equal 
footing with the latter. 

During the 1 8th century Irish Presbyterianism became infected 
with Arianism. Under the leadership of Dr Henry Cooke, a minister 
of rare ability and eloquence, the evangelical party triumphed in 
the church courts, and the Unitarians seceded and became a separate 
denomination. In 1840 the Synod of Ulster and the Secession 
Synod united to form the General Assembly of the Presbyterian 
Church in Ireland. 

The Presbyterian Church in Ireland is the most conservative 
of the great Presbyterian churches in the United Kingdom. Her 
attitude is one of sturdy adherence to the old paths of evangelical 
doctrine and Presbyterian polity. She has been a zealous supporter 
of Irish national education, which is theoretically " united secular 
and separate religious instruction." The Church Act of 1860 
which disestablished and disendowed the Irish Episcopal Church 
took away the Presbyterian regium donum. The ministers with 
all but absolute unanimity decided to commute their life-interest 
and form therewith a great furld for the support of the Church. 
The commutation fund thus formed is a permanent memorial 
of a generous and disinterested act on the part of her ministry. 
It amounted in 1902 to £588,028. The interest accruing from it 
is added to the yearly sustentation contributions, and forms a 
central fund for ministerial support. Since the state endowment 
ceased the average income of ministers from their congregations 
has considerably increased. 

The Irish Presbyterian Church has set an example to all her 
sister churches by her forwardness to care for the poor. Her 
11 Presbyterian Orphan Society " undertakes the support of every 
poor orphan child throughout the Church. No Presbyterian 
orphan child now needs to seek workhouse relief. The orphans 
are boarded in the homes of respectable poor people, who thus also 
benefit by the society. A scheme of pensions for her aged poor 
has been instituted. 

Three small communities of Presbyterians maintain a separate 
autonomy in Ireland, viz. the Reformed Presbyterian Church, 
with thirty-six; the Eastern Reformed, with six ; and the Secession 
Church, with ten congregations. 

Wales. 

The Presbyterian Church of Wales, commonly known as the 
" Calvinistic Methodist," had its origin in the great evangelical 
revival of the 18th century. Its polity has been of gradual 
growth, and still retains some features peculiar to itself. In 
181 1 its preachers were first presbytcrially ordained and author- 
ized to administer the sacraments. In 1823 a Confession of Faith 
was adopted. In 1864 the two associations or synods of North 
and South Wales were united in a general assembly. Great 
attention is given to the education of the ministry, a considerable 
number of whom, in recent years, have taken arts degrees at 
Oxford and Cambridge. As far as the difference in language 
will permit, there is cordial fellowship and co-operation with 
the Presbyterian Church of England. The appetite of the 
Welsh people for sermons is enormous, and the preachers are 
characterized by an exceptionally high order of pulpit power. 

(W. Y.) 
United States. 

Presbyterianism in the United States is a reproduction and 
further development of Presbyterianism in Europe. The history 
of the American Presbyterian churches, excluding the two 
"Reformed" Churches (see Reformed Church in the United 
States for the German body, and Reformed Church in 
America for the Dutch body), may be divided into three 
periods. 



PRESBYTERIANISM 



291 



1. The Colonial Period. — The earliest Presbyterian emigration 
consisted of French Huguenots under the auspices of Admiral 
Coligny, led to Port Royal, South Carolina, by Jean Ribaut in 
1562, and to Florida (near the present St Augustine) by Rene de 
Laudonniere in 1564, and by Ribaut in 1565. The former enter- 
prise was soon abandoned, and the colonists of the latter were 
massacred by the Spaniards. Under^ Pierre de Guast, sieur de 
Monts, Huguenots settled in Nova Scotia in 1604 but did not remain 
after 1607. Huguenot churches were formed on Staten Island, 
New York, in 1665; in New York City in 1683 ; at Charleston, South 
Carolina, in 1686; at Boston, Massachusetts, in 1687; at New 
Rochelle, New York, in 1688; and at other^ places. # The Charleston 
church alone of these early churches maintains its independence 
of any American denomination. 

English Puritans emigrated under the auspices of the Virginia 
Company to the Bermudas in 1612; and in 1617 a Presbyterian 
Church, governed by ministers and four elders, was established there 
by Lewis Hughes, who used the liturgy of the isles of Guernsey 
and Jersey. Beginning with 1620, New England was colonized 
by English Presbyterians of the two types which developed from 
the discussions of the Westminster Assembly (1643-1648) into 
Presbyterianism and Congregationalism. The Plymouth colony 
was rather of the Congregational type, and the Massachusetts 
Bay colony rather of the Presbyterian. These types co-operated 
as in Old England in the county associations; and a mixed system 
was produced, called by Henry M. Dexter " a Conjpegationalized 
Presbyterianism or a Presbyterianized Congregationalism." Presby- 
terianism was stronger in Connecticut than in Massachusetts. 
Thence it crossed into the Dutch settlements on the Hudson and 
the Delaware, and mingled with other elements in Virginia, Mary- 
land and the Carolinas. Nine of these Puritan Presbyterian 
churches were established on Long Island between 1640 and 1670 — 
one at Southampton and one at Southold (originally of the Congre- 
gational type) in 1640, one at Hempstead about 1644, one at Jamaica 
in 1662, and churches at Newtown and Setauket in the next half 
century; and three Puritan Presbyterian churches were established 
in Westchester county, New York, between 1677 and 1685. t In 
New York City, Francis Doughty preached to Puntan Presbyterians 
in 1643; in 1650 he was succeeded by Richard Denton (1586-1662). 
Doughty preached in Virginia and Maryland in 1 650-1659, and was 
the father of British Presbyterianism in the Middle Colonies. His 
work in Virginia and Maryland was carried on twenty-five years 
later by Francis Makemie (d. 1708). 

Irish Presbyterianism was carried to America by an unknown 
Irish minister in 1668.^ Its foremost representative was Francis 
Makemie, already mentioned, who, ini683, as an ordained minister 
of the presbytery of Laggan, was invited to minister to the Mary- 
land and Virginia Presbyterians. In 1684 he acted as pastor of 
an Irish church at Elizabeth River, Virginia; in 1699 received 
permission from the colonial authorities to preach at Pocomoke 
and Onancock on the eastern shore of Virginia, and about 1700 
organized a church at Snow Hill in Worcester county, Maryland; 
in 1 704 he returned to America from a trip to Great Britain in which 
he had interested the Presbyterians of London, Dublin and Glasgow 
in the American churches, and brought back with him two ordained 
missionaries, John Hampton (d. c. 1 721) and George McNish 
(1660-1723); in 1707 was imprisoned in New York City for 
preaching without licence, but was acquitted in 1708. 

To the banks of the Delaware the clergy of New England sent 
missionaries: Benjamin Woodbridge went to Philadelphia in 1698 
and was followed almost immediately by Jedediah Andrews (1674- 
1746), who was ordained in 1701, and under whom the first Presby- 
terian church in Philadelphia was organized; in 1698 John Wilson 
(d. 1 71 2) became pastor of a Presbyterian Church at New Castle, 
Delaware; Samuel Davis (d. 1725) seems to have preached as early 
as 1692 at Lewes, Delaware, and Nathaniel Taylor (d. 1710) was 
another of the New England missionaries along the Delaware 
river and bay. About 1695 Thomas Bridge, with Presbyterians 
from Fairfield county, Connecticut, settled at Cohan sey, in West 
Jersey. These New England ministers in the Delaware valley, 
with Francis Makemie as moderator, organized in 1706 the first 
American presbytery, the presbytery of Philadelphia. In 1716 
this presbytery became a synod by dividing itself into four " sub- 
ordinate meetings or presbyteries," after the Irish model. The 
synod increased the number of its churches by a large accession, 
from New York and from New Jersey, where there had been large' 
Presbyterian settlements. The synod seems to have remained 
without a constitution and without subscription until 1729, when 
it adopted the Westminster standards. In 1732 the presbytery of 
" Dunagall " (Donegal) was established in Lancaster county, 
Pennsylvania. 

Two parties had developed with the growth of the Church. The 
stricter party urged the adoption of the Westminster standards 
and^ conformity thereto; the broader party were unwilling to 
sacrifice their liberty. The former followed the model of the Church 
of Scotland ; the liberal party sympathized with the London and 
Dublin Presbyterians. The two parties united under the act of 
1729, which adopted the Westminster symbols ".as being, in all 
the essential and necessary articles, good forms of sound words 



and systems of Christian doctrine." This adopting act allowed 
scruples as to " articles not essential and necessary in doctrine, 
worship or government " — the presbytery being judge in the case 
and not the subscriber. In 1 730-1 732 the stricter party in the 
presbyteries of New Castle and Donegal insisted on full subscrip- 
tion, and in 1736, in a minority synod, interpreted the adopting 
act according to their own views. The liberals put themselves 
on guard against the plotting of the other side. Friction was 
increased by a contest between Gilbert Tennent and his friends, 
who favoured Whitefield and his revival measures, and Robert 
Cross (1689-1766), pastor at Jamaica in 1723-1758, and his friends. 
The Tennents erected the Log College (on the Neshaminy, about 
20 m. north of Philadelphia) to educate candidates for the ministry; 
and the synod in 1738 passed an act,, aimed at the Log College, 

Providing that all students not educated in the colleges of New 
England or Great Britain should be examined by a committee of 
synod, thus depriving the presbyteries of the right of determining 
in the case. The presbytery of New Brunswick declined to yield 
(1739). The Cross party charged the Tennents with heresy and 
disorder; the Tennents charged their opponents with ungodliness 
and tyranny. When the synod met in 1741 the moderate men 
remained away; and thus the synod broke in two. The New York 
presbytery declined at first to unite with either party, worked in 
vain for reconciliation, and finally joined with the Tennents in 
establishing the synod of New York (1745) which was called the 
New Side, in contradistinction to the synod of Philadelphia, the 
Old Side. 

During the separation the New Side established the college of 
New Jersey at Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth) in 1747, and the 
Log College of the Tennents was merged into it. It was removed 
to Princeton in 1755, funds for its aid being received from England, 
Ireland and Scotland. The Old Side adopted the academy at 
New London, Chester county, Pennsylvania, which had been organ- 
ized by Francis Alison in 17*11, as their own; but the New London 
school broke up when Alison became a professor in the Philadelphia 
Academy (afterwards the university of Pennsylvania). During 
the separation the synod of Philadelphia decreased from twenty- 
six to twenty-two ministers, but the synod of New York grew from 
twenty to seventy-two ministers, and the New Side reaped all the 
fruits of the Great Awakening under Whitefield and his successors. 
Different views on subscription and discipline, and the arbitrary 
act of excision were the barriers to union, but these were removed; 
in 1758 the adopting act was re-established in its original breadth, 
the ' Synod of New York and Philadelphia " was formed, and the 
reunion was signalized by the formation of the presbytery of Han- 
over in Virginia. Under John Witherspoon tlie college of New 
Jersey was the favoured school of the reunited church. The 
union was not perfect; the presbytery of Donegal was for three 
years in revolt against the synod; and in 1762 a second presbytery 
of Philadelphia was formed; but the strength of the synod increased 
rapidly and at the outbreak of the War of Independence it had 
11 presbyteries and 132 ministers. 

Presbyterianism had an independent development in the 
Carolinas, whither there was a considerable Scotch migration in 
168^.-1687. William Dunlop (c.^ 1650-1700) ministered to them 
until 1688, when he became principal of the university of Glasgow. 
At Charleston a mixed congregation of Scotch Presbyterians and 
English Puritans was organized in 1690. What is now Dorchester 
county, South Carolina, was settled in 1695 by members of a church 
established in Dorchester, Massachusetts. In 1710 there were five 
churches in the Carolinas; in 1 722-1 723 they formed the presbytery 
of James Island, which (after 1727) went through the same struggle 
as the synod a of Philadelphia in reference to subscription; and in 
1 73 1 the parties separated into subscribers and non-subscribers. 

From New England, as has been seen, Puritan settlers estab- 
lished Presbyterian churches (or churches which immediately 
became Presbyterian) in Long Island, on New Jersey, and in South 
Carolina; but the Puritans who remained in New England usually 
established Congregational churches. But there were exceptions: 
Irish Presbyterians from Ulster formed a church at Londonderry, 
New Hampshire, which, about 1729, grew into a presbytery; the 
Boston presbytery, organized in 1745, became in 1774 the synod 
of New England with three presbyteries and sixteen ministers; 
and there were two independent presbyteries, that of " the East- 
ward " organized at Boothbay, Maine, in 1771, and that of Grafton, 
in New Hampshire, founded- by Eleazar Wheel ock and other 
ministers interested in Dartmouth College. 

The Presbyterians from the Scotch Established Church combined 
with the American Presbyterian Church, but the separating churches 
of Scotland organized independent bodies. The Reformed Presby- 
terian Church (Covenanters) sent John Cuthbertson in 1751 ; he 
was joined in 1773 by Matthew Lind and Alexander Dobbin from the 
Reformed Presbytery of Ireland, and they organized in March 
1774 the Reformed Presbytery of America. The Anti-Burgher 
Synod sent Alexander Gellatly and Andrew Arnot in 1752, and two. 
years later they organized the Associate Presbytery of Pennsyl- 
vania; they were joined in 1757 by the Scotch Church in New York 
City, which had split off because of objections to the growing use 
of Watts's Psalms; they had grown to two presbyteries and thirteen

ministers in 1776. The Burgher Synod in 1764 sent Thomas 
Clarke of Bally bay r Ireland, who settled at Salem, Washington 
county, New York, and in 1776 sent David Telfair, of Monteith, 
Scotland, who preached in Philadelphia; they united with the 
Associate Presbytery of Pennsylvania; in 1771 the Scotch Synod 
ordered the presbytery to annul its union with the Burghers, and 
although Dr Clarke of Salem remained in the Associate Presbytery, 
the Burgher ministers who immigrated later joined the Associate 
Reformed Church. In 17 69- 17 74 there was a futile attempt to 
secure the union of the Associate Presbytery with the main American 
Church. 

2. From the War of Independence to the Civil War, — During 
the War of Independence the Presbyterian churches suffered 
severely. Ministers and people with few exceptions — the most 
notable being the Scotch Highlanders who had settled in the 
valley of the Mohawk in New York and on Cape Fear river in 
North Carolina — sided with the patriot or Whig party: John 
Witherspoon was the only clergyman in the Continental Congress 
of 1776, and was otherwise a prominent leader; John Murray 
of the Presbytery of the Eastward was an eloquent leader in 
New England; and in the South the Scotch-Irish were the back- 
bone of the American partisan forces, two of whose leaders, 
Daniel Morgan and Andrew Pickens, were Presbyterian elders. 

At the close of the War the Presbyterian bodies began at once 
to reconstruct themselves. In 1782 the presbyteries of the 
Associate and Reformed churches united, forming the Associate 
and Reformed Synod of North Am erica; but as there were a few 
dissenters in both bodies the older Associate and Reformed 
Presbyteries remained as separate units — the Associate Presby- 
tery continued to exist under the same name until 1801, when 
it became the Associate Synod of North America; in 1818 it 
ceased to be subordinate to the Scotch General Synod. The 
Associate Reformed Synod added in 1794 a fourth presbytery, 
that of Londonderry, containing most of the New England 
churches, but in 1801 " disclaimed " this presbytery because it 
did not take a sufficiently strict view of the question of psalm- 
singing. The Reformed Presbytery of North America was 
reconstituted by two ministers from Ireland in 1798; it became 
a synod of three presbyteries in 1809 and a general synod in 
1823; in the first decade of the century the presbytery required 
all members to free their slaves. The synod of New York and 
Philadelphia, which in 1781 had organized the presbytery of 
Redstone, the first of western Pennsylvania, in 1788 resolved 
itself into a General Assembly, which first met in Philadelphia 
in 1789, and after revising the chapters on Church and state, 
adopted the Westminster symbols as to their constitution, "as 
containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scrip- 
tures," and they made them unalterable without the consent 
of two-thirds of the presbyteries and the General Assembly. 
In 1 801 a " plan of union " proposed by the General Association 
(Congregational) of Connecticut was accepted by the General 
Assembly, and the work of home missions in the western section 
of the country was prosecuted jointly. The result was mixed 
churches in western New York and the new states west of the 
Alleghany Mountains, which grew into presbyteries and synods 
having peculiar features midway between Presbyterianism and 
Congregationalism . 

The general strictness of the church in its requirements for 
ministerial education occasioned it great loss in this period when 
the territory beyond the Appalachians was being settled so largely 
by Scotch-Irish and Presbyterians. The revivals in Kentucky 
brought about differences which resulted in the high-handed ex- 
clusion of the revivalists. These formed themselves into the 
presbytery of Cumberland, on the 4th of February 18 10, which grew 
in three years into a synod of three presbyteries and became the 
"Cumberland Presbyterian Church." In 1813 they revised the 
Westminster Confession and excluded, as they claimed, fatalism and 
infant damnation. If theyhad appealed to the General Assembly 
they might have received justice, or possibly the separation might 
have been on a larger scale. In 1822, under the influence of John 
Mitchell Mason (1770-1829), the Associate Reformed Synod com- 
bined with the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, 
but the majority was too slender to* make the union thorough. 
The greater part of the ministers decided to remain separate, 
and accordingly organized three independent synods — New York, 
Scioto and the Carolinas. In 1858 the associate synods of the 
north and west united with the Associate Synod as the United 



Presbyterian Church. In 1833 the Reformed Presbyterian Church 
divided into New Lights and Old Lights in a dispute as to the 
propriety of Covenanters exercising the rights of citizenship under 
the constitution of the United States. 

A great and widespread revival marked the opening years of 
the century, resulting in marvellous increase of zeal and numbers. 
New measures were adopted, doctrines were adapted to the times, 
and ancient disputes were revived between the conservative and 
progressive forces. Theological seminaries had been organized: 
the Theological Seminary of the Presbyterian Church at Princeton, 
N.J., founded in 1812 by the General Assembly; the Auburn 
Theological Seminary at Auburn, N.Y., founded in 1819 by the 
synod of Geneva, and afterwards associated with the New School; 
a school at Hampden Sidney, Virginia, founded by the synod of 
Virginia in 1824, named Union Theological Seminary in Virginia 
after 1826, supported after 1828 by the synods of Virginia and North 
Carolina, and in 1898 removed to Richmond, Va.; the Western 
Theological Seminary, founded at Allegheny (Pittsburg), Pa., in 
1827 by the General Assembly; the Presbyterian Theological 
Seminary at Columbia, South Carolina, founded in 1828 by the synod 
of South Carolina ; Lane Theological Seminary, founded indepen- 
dently in 1829 by the New School at Cincinnati, Ohio; and Union 
Theological Seminary, founded in 1836 by independent action of 
New School men, in New York City. Differences in doctrine as 
well as polity and discipline became more and more prominent. 
The doctrinal differences came to a head in the trials of George 
Dufheld (1832), Lyman Beecher (1835) and Albert Barnes (1836) 
which, however, resulted in the acquittal of the accused, but which 
increased friction and ill feeling. The differences developed were 
chiefly between general atonement and atonement for the elect 
only and between mediate imputation and immediate imputation. 

The agitation with reference to African slavery threw the bulk 
of the Southern Presbyterians on the Old Side, which was further 
strengthened by the accession of the Associate Reformed. The 
ancient differences between Old and New Side were revived, and 
once more it was urged that there should be (1) strict subscription, 
(2) exclusion of the Congregationalized churches, and strict Presby- 
terian polity and discipline, and (3) the condemnation and exclusion 
of the new divinity and the maintenance of scholastic orthodoxy. 
In 1834 a convention of the Old Side was held in Philadelphia, 
and the " Act and Testimony " was adopted charging doctrinal 
unsoundness and neglect of discipline upon the New Side, and urging 
that these should be excluded from the Church. The moderate 
men on both sides opposed this action and strove for peace or an 
amicable separation, but in vain. In 1837 the Old Side obtained 
the majority in the General Assembly for the second time only in 
seven years; they seized their opportunity and abrogated the " Plan 
of Union of 1801 with the Connecticut Congregationalists," cut 
off the synod of Western Reserve and then the synods of Utica, 
Geneva and Genesee, without a trial, and dissolved the third 
presbytery of Philadelphia without providing for the standing 
of its ministers. The New Side men met in convention at Auburn, 
N.Y., in August 1837, and adopted measures for resisting the wrong, 
but in the General Assembly of 1838 the moderator refused to re- 
cognize their commissioners. On an appeal to the assembly the 
moderator's decision was reversed, a new moderator was chosen, 
and the assembly adjourned to another place of meeting. The 
Old Side remained after the adjournment and organized them- 
selves, claiming the historic succession. Having the moderator 
and clerks from the assembly of 1837, they retained the books and 
papers. Thus two General Assemblies were organized, the Old and 
the New School. An appeal was made to the civil courts, which 
decided (1839) in favour of the New School; but this decision was 
overruled and a new trial ordered. It was deemed best, however, 
to cease litigation and to leave matters as they were. 

Several years of confusion followed. In 1840 we have the first 
safe basis for comparison of strength.

The " sides " remained separate throughout the remainder of this 
period. The North was especially agitated by the slavery ques- 
tion. 1 In 1847 the synod of the Free Presbyterian Church was 
formed by the anti-slavery secession of the presbytery of Ripley, 
O. (New School), and a part of the presbytery of Mahoning, Pa., 
(Old School) ; this synod, then numbering five presbyteries with 43 
ministers, joined the New School Assembly during the Civil War. 
In 1850 the New School Assembly declared slave-holding, unless 
excusable for some special reason, a cause for discipline; in 1853 
it asked the Southern presbyteries to report what action they had 
taken to put themselves in accord with the resolution of 1850; 

1 The separation of the southern part of the Associate Reformed 
Church from the northern in 1821, and the establishment of the 
Associate Reformed Synod of the South had not been due to slavery, 
but was for convenience in administration.

3. Since the beginning of the Civil War. — The Southern presby- 
teries of the Old School Assembly withdrew in 1861, and dele- 
gates from ten southern synods (47 presbyteries) met in Augusta, 
Georgia, in December, and organized as the General Assembly 
of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America, 
which included 700 ministers, 1000 churches and 75,000 com- 
municants. Its strength was increased by the addition: in 
1S63 of the small Independent Presbyterian Church of South 
Carolina; in 1865 of the United Synod (New School), which 
at that time had 120 ministers, 190 churches, and 12,000 com- 
municants; in 1867 of the presbytery of Patapsco; in 1869 
of the synod of Kentucky; and in 1874 of the synod of ^lissouri. 
At the close of the Civil War this Southern Church adopted the 
name of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the 
United States. 

In 186^ there was an unsuccessful attempt to combine all the 
Presbyterian bodiesof the North. In 1869 the Old and New Schools 
in the North combined on the basis of the common standards; to 
commemorate the union a memorial fund was raised which amounted 
in 1871 to $7,607,492. Between 1870 and 1881 three presbyteries 
of the Reformed Presbyterian General Synod (New School) joined 
the northern General Assembly. In 1906 the greater part of the 
Cumberland Presbyterian Church (then having 105,770 members) 
united with the northern General Assembly. Although the differ- 
ences between the Old School and the New School were much less 
in 1869 than in 1837 — during the separation the New School was 
conservative, the Old School liberal, in tendency — there were serious 
dissensions in the northern church after the union. The first of 
these was due to the adoption by certain teachers in theological 
seminaries of the methods and results of the " higher criticism," 
and two famous heresy cases followed. Charles Augustus Briggs, 
tried for heresy for his inaugural address in 1891 as professor of 
biblical theology at Union Seminary (in which he attacked the 
inerrancy of the Bible, held the composite character of the Hexa- 
teuch and of the Book of Isaiah and taught that sanctification is 
not complete at death), was acquitted by the presbytery of New 
York, but was declared guilty and was suspended from its ministry 
by the General Assembly of 1893. Henry Preserved Smith, pro- 
fessor of Hebrew and Old Testament exegesis in Lane Seminary, 
for a pamphlet published in 189 1 denying the inerrancy but affirm- 
ing the inspiration of the Scriptures, was suspended in 1892 by the 
presbytery of Cincinnati, and was unsuccessful in his appeal to the 
synod and to the General Assembly. Dr Briggs remained a member 
of the Union Seminary faculty but left the Presbyterian Church 
to enter the Protestant Episcopal. Dr Smith resigned his chair 
at Lane Seminary, and entered the Congregational ministry. In 
1 892-1893 there was an open break between the General Assembly 
and Union Seminary, which repudiated the agreement of 1870 l 
between the seminaries and the assembly ; the assembly disclaimed 
responsibility for the Seminary's teachings and withheld financial 
aid from its students. In 1896 McCormick Theological Seminary 
(which in 1858 as New Albany Theological Seminary had come under 
the control of the assembly) and Auburn Seminary refused to 
make the changes desired by the General Assembly ; a satisfactory 
arrangement with McCormick was made. Lane and Auburn 
remained practically independent. 

But although the conservative party was successful in inducing 
successive general assemblies to lay repeatedly stronger stress on 
the verbal inerrancy of Holy Scripture and to make beliel in such 
inerrancy a requisite of teachers in theological seminaries and of 
candidates for the ministry, there was in other matters an increas- 
ing liberal tendency. In 1902 the General Assembly adopted a 
Brief Statement of the Reformed Faith, not as a legal standard 
but as an interpretation of the confession; it repudiated the doctrine 
of infant damnation, insisted on the consistency of predestination 
with God's universal love, and incorporated new chapters on the 
Holy Spirit, the love of God, and missions. The Assembly of 
1906 authorized (but did not make mandatory) the use of a book 
of common worsh ip; the question of a liturgy had been opened in 

1 This agreement, proposed to the General Assembly in 1870 
by the directors of Princeton and of Union, gave the Assembly 
a veto on the election and removal of professors. 



1855 by C. VV. Baird's Eutaxia; in 1864 Charles VV. Shields (1825- 
1904), who afterwards entered the Protestant Episcopal Church, 
republished and urged the adoption of the Book of Common Prayer 
as amended by the Westminster Divines in the royal commission 
of 1661; and Henry Van Dyke was prominent in the latter stage 
of the movement for a liturgy. 

The northern General Assembly and the Cumberland Church, 
which united with it in 1906, arc the only Presbyterian bodies 
in America that have done anything tangible for Christian 
union in the last fifty years: the. southern Assembly is much 
more conservative than the northern— in 1866 it suspended 
James Woodrow (1828-1907), professor of natural science in 
connexion with revealed religion, for holding evolutionary 
views, and it declared that Adam's body was " directly fashioned 
by Almighty God, without any natural animal parentage of 
any kind, out of matter previously created out of nothing"; 
and in 1897 it ordered that women were not to speak in pro- 
miscuous meetings — and its attitude toward the negro, insisting 
in separate church organizations for blacks and whites, makes 
union with the northern bodies difficult; the United Presbyterian 
Church in North America in 1890 refused to join the union of 
Presbyterian and Reformed missions in India, and its opposition 
to instrumental music and to the use of any songs but the 
psalms of the Old Testament, although this is decreasing in 
strength, are bars to union; the synod of the Reformed Presby- 
terian Churcli of North America in 1888 refused to unite with 
the United Presbyterian Church because the latter did not 
object to the secular character of the constitution of the United 
States; and with the general synod of the Reformed Presby- 
terian Church the synod could not unite in 1890 because the 
general synod allowed and the synod did not allow its members 
to " incorporate " themselves with the political system of the 
United States. A loose union, called the " Federal Council of 
the Reformed Churches in America/' was formed in 1894 by 
the churches mentioned (excepting the Southern Assembly) 
and the Dutch and German Reformed churches. 

More or less closely connected with the Northern Church are the 
theological seminaries at Princeton, Auburn, Pittsburg (formerly 
Allegheny— the Western Seminary), Cincinnati (Lane), New York 
(Union) and Chicago (McCormick), already named, and San Fran- 
cisco Seminary (1871) since 1892 at San Anselmo, Cal., a theo- 
logical seminary (1891) at Omaha, Nebraska, a German theological 
seminary (1869) at Bloomfield, New Jersey, the German Presby- 
terian Theological School of the North-west (1852) at Dubuque, 
Iowa, and the Presbyterian Theological Seminary of Kentucky, 
which is under the control and supervision of the northern and 
southern churches. Seminaries of the Southern Church are the 
Union Theological Seminary at Richmond, Virginia, and the 
Columbia Theological Seminary at Columbia, South Carolina, 
already mentioned, the Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary 
(1902) at Austin, Texas, the theological department in the South- 
western Presbyterian University at Clarksville, Tennessee, and, 
for negroes, Stillman Institute (1877), at Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The 
United Presbyterian Church has two seminaries, one at Xenia, 
Ohio, and one at Allegheny (Pittsburg). Of the Covenanter bodies 
the synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church has a theological 
seminary in Allegheny (Pittsburg), established in 1856, and the 
general synod in 1887 organized a college at Cedarville, Ohio. 
The Associate Reformed Synod of the South has the Erskine Theo- 
logical Seminary (1837) in Due West, South Carolina. 

The foreign missionary work of the General Assembly had been 
carried on after 1812 through the (Congregational) American Board 
of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (organized in 1810) until 
the separation of 1837, when the Old School Assembly established 
its own board of foreign missions; the New School continued to 
work through the American board; after the union of 1869 the 
separate board was perpetuated and the American board trans- 
ferred to it, with the contributions made to the American board 
by the New School churches, the missions in Africa (1833), in Syria 
(1822), and in Persia (1835). The Church now has, besides these 
missions, others in India (1834), Siam (1840), China (1846), Colombia 
(1856), Brazil (1850), Japan (1859), Laos (1867), Mexico (transferred 
in 1872 by the American and Foreign Christian Union), Chile 
(transferred in 1873 by the same Union; first established in 1845), 
Guatemala (1882), Korea (1884) and the Philippine Islands (1899). 
A board of home missions w*as organized in 18 16; a board of 
education in 1819; a woman's board of foreign missions in 1869; 
a women s executive committee for home mission work (which 
takes particular interest in the work for the freedmen) in 1878; 
a board of publication in 1838 (after 1887 called the board of 
Publication and Sunday School Work) ; a board of aid for collects

PRESBYTERY— PRESCOTT 



(1883); a board of church erection in 1844; a board of work for 
freedmen; and a board of ministerial relief; after the union of 
1869 the Board of Home Missions was removed from Philadelphia 
to New York City. 

The Southern Church, unlike the Northern, is not working through 
" boards," but through executive committees, which were formerly 
more loosely organized, and which left to the presbyteries the more 
direct control of their activities, but which now differ little from 
the boards of the northern Church. It has: an executive com- 
mittee on foreign missions (first definitely organized bv the 
Assembly in 1877), which has missions in China (1867), Brazil 
(1869), Mexico (1874), Japan (1885), Congo Free State (1891), 
Korea (1896) and Cuba (180,9); and executive committees of home 
missions (1865), of publication and sabbath school work, of minis- 
terial education and relief, of schools and colleges and of colored 
evangelization (formed in 1891). Permanent committees on the 
" sabbath and family religion/* the " Bible cause " and 
" evangelistic work " report to the General Assembly annually. 

The .United Presbyterian Church has a board of foreign missions 
(reorganized in 1859) with missions in Egypt (1853), now a synod 
with four presbyteries (in 1909, 71 congregations, 70 ministers 
and 10,341 members), in the Punjab (1S54), now a synod with 
four presbyteries (in 1909, 35 congregations, 51 ministers and 
17,321 members), and in the Sudan (i90i);and boards of home 
missions (reorganized, 1859), church extension (1859), publication 
(1859), education (1859), ministerial relief (1862), and missions 
to the freedmen (1863). 

Presbyterians of different churches in the United States in 
1906 numbered 1,830,555; of this total 322,542 were in Penn- 
sylvania, where there were 248,335 members of the Presbyterian 
Church in the United States of America (the Northern Church), 
being more than one-fifth of its total membership; 56,587 mem- 
bers of the Urn ted Presbyterian Church of North America, 
being more than two-fifths of its total membership; 2709 mem- 
bers of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of 
North America, three-tenths of its total membership; the 
entire membership of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in 
the United States and Canada (440), 3150 members of the Welsh 
Calvinistic Methodist Church, nearly one-fourth of its total 
membership; and 2065 members of the Reformed Presbyterian 
Church in North America, general synod, about five-ninths 
of its total membership. The strength of the Church in Penn- 
sylvania is largely due to the Scotch-Irish settlements in that 
state. Philadelphia is the home of the boards of publication 
and of Sunday schools of the Northern Church; and in Allegheny 
(Pittsburg) are the principal theological seminary of the United 
Presbyterian body and its publishing house. In New York state 
there were 199,923 Presbyterians, of whom 186,278 were members 
of the Northern Church and 10,115 of the United Presbyterian 
Church of North America. In Ohio there were 138,768 Presby- 
terians, 114,772 being of the Northern and 18,336 of the United 
Presbyterian Church. The other states with a large Presbyterian 
population were Illinois(ii5, 602; 86,251 of the Northern Church; 
17,208 of the Cumberland Church; 9555 of the United Presby- 
terian Church); New Jersey (79,912; 78,490 of the Northern 
Church); Tennessee (79,337; 42,464 being Cumberland Presby- 
terians, more than one-fifth of the total membership; 6640 of 
the Colored Cumberland Church, more than one-third of its 
membership; 21,390 of the Southern Church; and 6786 of the 
Northern Church); Missouri (71,599; 28,637 of the Cumberland 
Church; 25,991 of the Northern Church; 14,713 of the Southern 
Church); Texas (62,090; 31,598 of the Cumberland Church; 
2 3>934 of the Southern Church; 4118 of the Northern Church;

PRESBYTERY, in architecture, that portion of the choir 
of a church in which the high altar is placed, and which is 
generally raised by a few steps above the rest of the church. 
It is reserved for the priests, and in that respect differs from the 
choir, the stalls in which are occasionally occupied by the laity. 
In Westminster Abbey the space east of the transept is the 
presbytery, and the same arrangement is found in Canterbury 
Cathedral. In San Clemente at Rome the presbytery is enclosed 
with a marble balustrade or screen. For the use of the word 
in Church government see Presbyter and Presbyterianism. 

PRESCOT, a market town and urban district in the Ormskirk 
parliamentary division of Lancashire, England, 8 m. E. of 
Liverpool by the London & North Western railway. Pop. 
(1901), 7855. It is of considerable antiquity, and received a 
grant for a market and fair in the 7th year of Edward III. 
A church existed in the 13 th century. The present church of 
St Mary is in various styles, with a lofty tower and spire and 
carved timber roof. The chief industry is the making of watches, 
and the town has long been celebrated for the production of watch 
movements and tools. The industry was first introduced in 1730 
by John Miller from Yorkshire. There is also a manufacture 
of electric cables. John Philip Kemble, the actor, was born 
at Prescot in 1757. To the north of the town is Knowsley Park, 
the demesne of the earls of Derby, with a mansion of various 
dates from the 15th century onward, containing a fine collection 
of pictures. Prescot was formerly of greater importance in 
relation to the now populous district of south-west Lan- 
cashire; it was also a postal centre, and it is curious to notice 
that such addresses as " Liverpool, near Prescot " were 
necessary. 

PRESCOTT, WILLIAM HICKLING (1796-1859), American 
historian, was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on the 4th of May 
1796. His grandfather was Colonel William Prescott (1726- 
1795), who commanded at the battle of Bunker Hill; and his 
father was a well-known lawyer. He received his earlier educa- 
tion in his native city, until the removal of his family in 1808 to 
Boston. He entered Harvard College in the autumn of 181 1, 
but almost at the outset his career was interrupted by an accident 
which affected the subsequent course of his life. A hard piece 
of bread, flung at random in the Commons Hall, struck his left 
eye and destroyed the sight. After graduating honourably in 
1 8 14 he entered his father's office as a student of law; but in 
January 181 5 the uninjured eye showed dangerous symptoms of 
inflammation. When at last in the autumn he was in condition 
to travel, it was determined that he should pass the winter at St 
MichaePs and in the spring obtain medical advice in Europe. 
His visit to the Azores, which was constantly broken by con- 
finement to a darkened room, is chiefly noteworthy from the 
fact that he there began the mental discipline which enabled 
him to compose and retain in memory long passages for subse- 
quent dictation; and, apart from the gain in culture, his journey 



PRESCOTT

to England, France, and Italy (April 1816 to July 1817) was 
scarcely satisfactory. The verdict of the physicians was that 
the injured eye was hopelessly paralysed, and that the preserva- 
tion of the sight of the other depended upon the maintenance of 
his general health. His further pursuit of the legal profession 
seemed to be out of the question, and on his return to Boston he 
remained quietly at home. On 4th May 1820 he was married 
to Miss Susan Amory. Prior to his marriage he had made a 
few experiments in composition, but he now finally decided to 
devote his life to literature. A review of Byron's Letters on 
Pope in 1 82 1 constituted his first contribution to the North 
American Review, to which he continued for many years to send 
the results of his slighter researches. He next turned to French 
literature, and to the early English drama and ballad literature. 
Of the direction and quality of his thought at this time he has 
left indications in his papers on Essay-Writing (1822) and on 
French and English Tragedy (1823). In pursuance of his method 
of successive studies he began in 1823 the study of Italian 
literature, passing over German as demanding more labour than 
he could afford. In the following year he made his first acquaint- 
ance with the literature of Spain under the influence of his 
friend and biographer, Ticknor; and, while its attractiveness 
proved greater than he had at the outset anticipated, the com- 
parative novelty of the subject as a field for research served as 
an additional stimulus. 

In the meantime his aims had been gradually concentrating. 
History had always been a favourite study with him, and Mably's 
Observations sitr Vhistoire appears to have had considerable 
influence in determining him to the choice of some special period 
for historic research. The selection, however, was not finally 
made without prolonged hesitation. It was not till the 19th 
of January 1826 that he recorded in the private memoranda 
begun by him in 1820 his decision " to embrace the gift of the 
Spanish subject." The choice was certainly a bold one. He 
could only use the eye which remained to him for brief and 
intermittent periods, and as travelling affected his sight pre- 
judicially he could not anticipate any personal research amongst 
unpublished records and historic scenes. He was happy, how- 
ever, in the possession of ample means and admirable friends; 
and he sketched with no undue restriction or hesitancy the plan 
of the History of the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella — his first 
great work. Mr English, one of his secretaries, has furnished 
a picture of him at this period seated in a study lined on two sides 
with books and darkened by green screens and curtains of blue 
muslin, which required readjustment with almost every cloud 
that passed across the sky. His writing apparatus — a nocto- 
graph — lay before him, and he kept his ivory style in his hand to 
jot down notes as the reading progressed. In accordance with 
his general method these notes were in turn read over to him 
until he had completely mastered them, when they were worked 
up in his memory to their final shape. So proficient did he 
become that he was able to retain the equivalent of sixty pages 
of printed matter in his memory, turning and returning them as 
he walked or drove. The rate of progress was necessarily slow, 
apart from any liability to interruption by other undertakings 
and failures in bodily health. He still continued his yearly 
experimental contributions to the North American Review, 
elaborating them with a view as much to ultimate historical 
proficiency as to immediate literary effect, the essays on Scottish 
Song (1826), Novel-Writing (1827), Moliere (1828), and Irving's 
Granada (1829) belonging to this preparatory period. On the 
6th of October 1829 he began the actual work of composition, 
which was continued without more serious interruptions than 
those occasioned by the essays on Asylums for the Blind (1830), 
Poetry and Romance of the Italians' (1831), and English Literature 
of the igth Century (1832), until the 25th of June 1836, when the 
concluding note was written/ Another year, during which his 
essay on Cervantes appeared, was spent in the final revision of 
the. History for the press. Its success upon its publication in 
Boston was immediate. Arrangements were speedily made for 
its publication in England, and there its success was not less 
marked. From the position of an obscure reviewer Prescott 



suddenly found himself elevated to the first rank of contemporary 
historians. 

After coquetting for a short time with the project of a life 
of Moliere he decided to follow in the track of his first work 
with a History of the Conquest of Mexico. Washington Irving, 
who had already made preparations to occupy the same field, 
generously withdrew in his favour. The work was completed in 
August 1843, thefive years' labour having been broken by the 
composition of reviews of Lockhart's Life of Scott (1838), Kenyon's 
Poems (1839), Chateaubriand (1839), Bancroft's United States 
(1841), Mariotti's Italy (1842), and Madame Calderon's Life in 
Mexico (1843), and by the preparation of an abridgment of 
his Ferdinand and Isabella in anticipation of its threatened 
abridgment by another hand. On the 6th of December 1843 
the Conquest of Mexico was published with a success propor- 
tionate to a wide reputation won by his previous work. The 
careful methods of work which he had adopted from tbe outset 
had borne admirable fruit. While the consultation of authorities 
had been no less thorough, his style had become more free and 
less self-conscious; and the epic qualities of the theme were such 
as to call forth in the highest degree his powers of picturesque 
narration. 

It was only a step from the conquest of Mexico to that of 
Peru, and scarcely three months elapsed before he began to 
break ground on the latter subject. In February 1845 he 
received the announcement of his election as corresponding 
member of the French Institute in place of the Spanish historian 
Navarrete, and also of the Royal Society of Berlin. The winter 
found him arranging for the publication in England of the 
selection from his articles and reviews which appeared in 1845, 
under the title of Critical and historical Essays t and was issued 
almost contemporaneously at New York under the title of 
Biographical and Critical Miscellanies. The Conquest of Peru 
was completed in November 1846 and published in March 
following. His misgivings as to its reception were at once set 
at rest, and it was speedily issued in translations into French, 
Spanish, German and Dutch, in addition to the English editions 
of New York, London and Paris. 

He was now over fifty and his sight showed serious symptoms 
of enfeeblement. Although during the composition of the 
Ferdinand and Isabella it had been of very intermittent service 
to him, it had so far improved that he could read with a certain 
amount of regularity during the writing of the Conquest of Mexico, 
and also, though in a less degree, during the years devoted to the 
Conquest of Peru. Now, however, the use of his remaining eye 
had been reduced to an hour a day, divided into portions at 
wide intervals, and he was driven to the conclusion that whatever 
plans he made must be formed on the same calculations as those 
of a blind man. He bad been for many years collecting materials 
for a history of Philip II., but he hesitated for some time to 
attempt a work of such magnitude, occupying himself in the 
meantime with the slighter labours of a memoir of John Pickering 
for the Massachusetts Historical Society and the revision of 
Ticknor's History of Spanish Literature. But in March 1848 he 
set himself with characteristic courage to the accomplishment of 
the larger project. He had been fortunate in obtaining the 
aid of Don Pascual de Gayangos, then professor of Arabic 
literature at Madrid, by whose offices he was enabled to obtain 
material not only from the pubtic archives of Spain but from 
the muniment rooms of the great Spanish families. With an 
exceptional range of information thus afforded him, he wrote the 
opening of his history in July 1849; but, finding himself stiU 
unsettled in his work, he decided in the spring of the following 
year to carry out a long projected visit to England. Tbe idea 
of writing memoirs was dismissed in favour of the more elaborate 
form, and in November 1855 the first two volumes of his uncom- 
pleted History of Philip II. were issued from the press, their 
sale eclipsing that of any of his earlier books. This was his 
last great undertaking; but as Robertson's Charles V., in the 
light of new sources of information, was inadequate to take its 
place as a link in the series, he republished it in an improved 
and extended form in December 1856. A slight attack of 



296 



PRESCRIPTION 



apoplexy on the 4th of February 1858 foretold the end, though he 
persevered with the preparation of the third volume of Philip 
II. for the press, and with the emendation and annotation of 
his Conquest of Mexico. On the morning of the 27 th of January 
1859 a second attack occurred, and he died in the afternoon of 
the same day in his sixty-third year. 

As an historian Prescott stands in the direct line of literary descent 
from Robertson, whose influence is clearly discernible both in his 
method and style. But, while Robertson was in some measure the 
initiator of a movement, Prescott came to his task when the range 
of information was incomparably wider and when progress in 
sociologic theory had thrown innumerable convergent lights upon 
the progress of events. He worked, therefore, upon more assured 
ground ; his sifting of authorities was more thorough and his method 
less restricted. At the same time he cannot be classed as in the 
highest sense a philosophic historian. His power lies chiefly in the 
clear grasp of fact, in selection and synthesis, in the vivid narration 
of incident. For extended analysis he had small liking and faculty; 
his critical insight is limited in range, and he confines himself almost 
wholly to the concrete elements of history. When he does venture 
upon more abstract criticism his standards are often commonplace 
and superficial, and the world scheme to which he relates events 
is less profound than the thought of his time altogether warranted. 
Moreover, the authorities on whom he relied have had to be corrected 
since in many points of detail in the light of later archaeological 
research. If these things, however, indicate Prescott 's deficiencies 
from the point of view of ideal history, few historians have had in 
a higher degree that artistic feeling in the broad arrangement of 
materials which ensures popular interest. The course of his narrative 
is unperplexed by doubtful or insoluble problems. The painting 
is filled in with primary colours and with a free hand; and any sense 
of crudity which may be awakened by close inspection is compensated 
by the vigour and massive effectiveness of the whole. 

Prescott's works in 16 vols, were edited by J. F. Kirk in 1870-1874. 
His Life was written by George Ticknor (1864; revised 1875). There 
are later lives by R. Ogden (ioo4).and H. T. Peck (1905). 

PRESCRIPTION, in the broadest sense, the acquisition or 
extinction of rights by lapse of time. The term is derived from 
the praescriptio of Roman law, originally a matter of procedure, 
a clause inserted before the formula on behalf of either the 
plaintiff or, in early times, the defendant, limiting the question 
at issue. It was so called from its preceding the formula} One 
of the defendant's praescriptiones was longi temporis or longae 
possessions praescriptio (afterwards superseded by the exceptio), 
limiting the question to the fact of possession without interrup- 
tion by the defendant for a certain time. It seems to have been 
introduced by the praetor to meet cases affecting aliens or 
lands out of Italy where the usucapio of the civil law (the original 
means of curing a defect of title by lapse of time) could not 
apply. The time of acquisition by usucapio was fixed by the 
Twelve Tables at one year for movables and two years for 
immovables. Praescriptio thus constituted a kind of praetorian 
usucapio. In the time of Justinian usucapio and praescriptio 
(called also longi temporis possessio), as far as they affected the 
acquisition of ownership, differed only in name, usucapio being 
looked at from the point of view of property, praescriptio from 
the point of view of pleading. By the legislation of Justinian 
movables were acquired by three years' possession, immovables 
by ten years' possession where the parties had their domicile 
in the same province {inter praesentes) i twenty years' possession 
where they were domiciled in different provinces {inter absentes). 
Servitudes could not be acquired by usucapio proper, but were 
said to be acquired by quasi usucapio, probably in the same time 
as sufficed to give a title to immovables. There was also a 
longissimi temporis possessio of thirty years, applicable to both 
movables and immovables, and requiring nothing but bona fides 
on the part of the possessor. Where the right sought to be estab- 
lished was claimed against the Church, a still longer period of 
forty years (at one time a hundred) was necessary. Immemorial 
prescription was required in a few cases of a public character, 
as roads. 2 Praescriptio was also the term applied to lapse of 
time as barring actions upon contracts or torts under various 
provisions corresponding to the English Statutes of Limitation. 
The prescription of Roman law (and of modern systems based 
upon it) is thus both acquisitive and extinctive. It looks either 

1 " Praescriptiones autem appellatas esse ab eo quod ante formula 
praescribuntur " (Gaius iv. § 132). 

2 " Viae vicinales, quarum memoria non cxtat " {Dig. xhn. 7, 3). 



to the length of time during which the defendant has been in 
possession, or to the length of time during which the plaintiff 
has been out of possession. In English law the latter kind of 
prescription is called limitation. The tendency of law is to 
substitute a definite for an indefinite period of prescription. 

In English law prescription is used in a comparatively narrow 
sense. It is acquisitive only, and is very limited in its application. 
A title by prescription can be made only to incorporeal hereditaments 
— that is, in legal language, hereditaments that are or have been 
appendant or appurtenant to corporeal hereditaments — and to 
certain exemptions and privileges. 8 The rights claimable by pre- 
scription for the most part consist of rights in alieno solo. The 
most important are advowsons, tithes, commons, ways, watercourses, 
lights, offices, dignities, franchises, pensions, annuities and rents. 
Land or movables cannot be claimed by prescription. The founda- 
tion of prescription is the presumption of law that a person found 
in undisturbed enjoyment of a right did not come into possession 
by an unlawful act (see Williams, Rights of Common, 3). In the 
English courts this presumption was, perhaps still is, based upon 
the fiction of a lost grant, viz. that therehad been a grant of the 
hereditament by a person capable of granting it to a person capable 
of taking it, and that the grant had been lost. The jury were 
instructed to find the loss of a once existing grant in whose existence 
no one really believed. The enjoyment of the right must have 
been from a time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the 
contrary. The period of legal memory was after a time necessarily 
fixed for purposes of convenience at a certain date. The date 
adopted varied at first with the time during which the demandant * 
in a writ of right must have proved seisin in himself or his ancestors. 
After one or two previous enactments the date was finally fixed by 
the Statute of Westminster the First (3 Edw. I. c. 39) at the reign 
of Richard I., which was interpreted to mean the first year of the 
reign of Richard I. (1189). The inconvenience of this remote date, 
as time went on, led to the gradual growth of a rule of t evidence that 
proof of enjoyment for twenty years was < prima facie evidence of 
enjoyment from time immemorial. But evidence of the beginning of 
the enjoyment at however remote a date, if subsequent to 1 Richard I., 
was sufficient to destroy the claim. This is still the law with respect 
to claims not falling within the Prescription Act, mostly rights in 
gross — that is, where there is no dominant or servient tenement, 
e.g. a right to a pew or to a several^ fishery in gross. The twenty 
years' rule was of comparatively late introduction ; it does not seem 
to have been known in the time of Elizabeth, and was perhaps 
introduced in analogy to the Statute of Limitations, 21 Jac. I. c. 16. 
With respect to claims of profits a prendre and easements a change 
was made by the Prescription Act 1832 (extended to Ireland by 
an act of 1858, but not to Scotland). By that act claims to rights 
of common and other profits a prendre are not to be defeated after 
thirty years' enjoyment by any person claiming right thereto without 
interruption for thirty years by showing only the commencement 
of the right, and after sixty years' enjoyment the right is absolute 
and indefeasible unless had by consent or agreement by deed or 
writing (§1). In claims of nghts of way or other easements the 

Ceriods are twenty years and forty years respectively (§2). The 
efore-mentioned periods are to be deemed those next before suits, 
and nothing is to be deemed to be an interruption unless acquiesced 
in for one year (§ 4). In pleading, the enjoyment as of right may 
be alleged during the period mentioned in the act, and without 
claiming in the name or right of the owner of the fee (§5)- No 
presumption is to be made in favour of a right exercised for a less 
period (§ 6). The time during which a person otherwise capable of 
resisting a claim is an infant, idiot, non compos mentis, feme covert, 
or tenant for life, or during svhich an action or suit has been pending 
until abated by the death of a party, is to be excluded in the com- 
putation of the periods unless where the right or claim is declared 
to be absolute and indefeasible (§7). An act to define the period 
of prescription for a modus decimandi, or an exemption from tithes 
by composition, was passed the same year. The Prescription Act 
is only supplemented to the common law, so that a claim may be 
based upon the act or, in the alternative, upon the common law. 
Nor does the act alter the conditions necessary at common law for 
a good claim by prescription. The claim under the statute must 
be one which may be lawfully made at common law. The principal 
rules upon the subject are these. (1) The title is founded upon 
actual usage. The amount of actual usage and the evidence necessary 
to prove it vary according to the kind of claim. (2) The enjoyment 
must (except in the case of light) be as of right — that is to say, peace- 
able, openly used, and not by .licence. (3) The prescription must 
be certain and reasonable. Inhabitants cannot, however, claim by 
prescription, as they are an uncertain and fluctuating body, unless 
under a grant from the Crown, which constitutes them a corporation 
for the purposes of the grant. (4) The prescription must be alleged 
in a que estate or in a man and his an cestors. Prescription in a 

8 Prescription seems at one time to have borne a wider meaning. 
A claim by prescription to land is mentioned in 32 Hen. VIII. c. 2. 
And it seems that tenants in common may still make tide to land by 
prescription (Littleton's Tenures, § 310).

que estate lies at common law by reason of continuous and immemorial 
enjoyment by the claimant, a person seised in fee, and all those whose 
estate he had (toux ceux que estate il ad). The Prescription Act fixes 
a definite period and does away with the necessity which existed 
at common law of prescribing in the name of the person seised in 
fee. Prescription in a man and his ancestors is not of ordinary 
occurrence in practice. Corporations, however, occasionally claim 
by a prescription analogous to this, viz. in the corporation and its 
predecessors. Such claims by cither a person or a corporation arc 
not within the Prescription Act, which applies only where there 
arc dominant and servient tenements. By 32 Hen. VIII. c. 2 
(1540) no person can make any prescription by the seisin or possession 
of his ancestor unless such scisen or possession had been within 
threescore years next before such prescription made. (5) A pre- 
scription cannot lie for a thing which cannot be granted, as it rests 
upon the presumption of a lost grant. Thus a lord of a manor 
cannot prescribe to raise a tax or toll upon strangers, for such 
a claim could never have been good by any grant. 

Prescription and Custom. — Prescription must be carefully t dis- 
tinguished from custom. Prescription, as has been said, is either 
in a que estate or in a man and his ancestors — that is to say, it is a 
personal claim; custom is purely local— that is to say, it is a usage 
obtaining the force of law within a particular district. In the time 
of Littleton the difference between prescription and custom was not 
fully recognized (see Littleton's Tenures, § 170), but the law as it 
exists at present had become established by the time of Sir Edward 
Coke. A custom must be certain, reasonable and exercised as of 
right. Like prescription at common law, it must have existed from 
time immemorial. On this ground a custom to erect stalls at 
statute sessions for hiring servants was held to be bad, because such 
sessions were introduced by the Statute of Labourers, 23 Edw. III. 
st. 1 (Simpson v. Wells, L.R., 7 Q.B., 214). Some rights may be 
claimed by custom which cannot be claimed by prescription, e.g. a 
right of inhabitants to dance on a village green, for sucn a right is 
not connected with the enjoyment of land. On the other hand, 
profits d prendre can be claimed by prescription but not by custom, 
unless in two or three exceptional cases, suchas rights of copy- 
holders to common in the lord* s demesne, or to dig sand within their 
tenements, rights to estovers in royal forests, and rights of tin- 
bounders in Cornwall. 

United States. — The Law of the United States (except in Louisiana) 
is based upon that of England, but the period of enjoyment necessary 
to found a title by prescription varies in the different states. An 
easement or profit d prendre is acquired by twenty years' enjoyment 
in most states, following the English common law rule. In Louisiana 
the period varies according to the subject from three to thirty years, 
and property other than incorporeal hereditaments may be claimed 
by prescription as in Roman law (see Kent's Comm. iii. 442). 

International Law uses the term " prescription " in its wider or 
Roman sense. " The general consent of mankind has established 
the principle that long and uninterrupted possession by one nation 
excludes the claim of every other" (Wheaton, Int. Law, § 165). 
Historic instances of rights which were at one time claimed and 
exercised by prescription as against other nations are the sovereignty 
of Venice over the Adriatic and of Great Britain over the Narrow 
Seas, and the right to the Sound dues long exacted by Denmark. 
But such claims were rejected by the highest authorities on inter- 
national law (e.g. Grotius), on the ground that they were defective 
both in Justus titulus and in de facto possession. There is no special 
period fixed, as in municipal law, for the acquirement of international 
rights by lapse of time. In private international law prescription 
is treated as part of the lex fori or law of procedure. (J. W.) 

Scotland. — In the law of Scotland " prescription " is a term of 
wider meaning than in England, being used as including both pre- 
scription and limitation of English law. In its most general sense 
it may be described as the effect which the law attaches to the lapse 
of time, and it involves the idea of oossession held by one person 
adverse to the rights of another. Though having its basis in the 
common law, its operation was early defined by statute, and it is 
now in all respects statutory. Prescription in Scots law may be 
regarded (1) as a mode of acquiring rights — the positive prescrip- 
tion ; (2) as a mode of extinguishing rights— the negative prescription ; 
(3) as a mode of limiting rights of action — the shorter prescriptions. 
It must, however, be observed with reference to this division that 
the distinction between (1) and (2) is rather an accidental (due to 
a loose interpretation of the language of the act of 161 7, c. 12) than a 
logically accurate one. It is, moreover, strictly confined to heritable 
rights, having no application in the case of movable property. But, 
though the distinction has been complained of by the highest 
authority as tending to create embarrassment in the law (see opinion 
of Lord Chancellor St Leonards in Dougall v. Dundee Harbour 
Trustees, 1852, 24 Jurist, 385), it is now too well settled to be 
departed from. 

1. Positive Prescription. — The positive prescription was introduced 
by the act of 161 7, c. 12. After setting forth in the preamble the 
inconvenience resulting from the loss of titles and trie danger of 
forgery after the means of improbation are lost by the lapse of time, 
it enacts that whatever heritages the lieges, their predecessors or 
authors have possessed by themselves or others in their names 
peaceably, in virtue of infeftments for the space of forty years, 



continually and together, from the date of their said infeftments, 
and without any lawfulinterruption during the said space, they shall 
not be disturbed therein, provided they produce a written title on 
which their possession has proceeded. Such written title must be 
cither a charter and sasine preceding the forty years, or, when no 
charter is extant, instruments of sasine proceeding upon retours or 
precepts of dare constat. Though the statute in its literal construc- 
tion only applied to such heritable subjects as had been conveyed 
by charter and sasine, it was at an early date interpreted so as to 
include other heritable rights, as servitudes, tacks, public rights of 
way, &c, where no charter could be supposed to exist. The act 
of 1 61 7 was so well framed that it continued to regulate the pre- 
scription of land rights till 1874. By the Conveyancing Act of 
that year (37 & 38 Vict. c. 94, § 34) the period of prescription was 
shortened from forty years to twenty. It was provided that posses- 
sions for twenty years upon " an ex facie valid irredeemable title 
recorded in the appropriate register of sasincs " should in future 
give the same right as forty years' possessions upon charter and 
sasine under the earlier law. The act of 1874 does not, however, 
apply to all the cases which fell under the act of 161 7. Thus it has 
been decided that twenty years' possession on a charter of adjudica- 
tion followed by sasine and a declarator of expiry of the legal is 
insufficient to give an unchallengeable right, an adjudication not 
being an " ex facie irredeemable title " [Htnton v. ConneVs Trustees, 
1883, 10 Rettie's Reports, p. mo). It is further specially provided 
by the act of 1874 that the twenty years' prescription is not to apply 
to servitudes, rights of way, and public rights generally. The 
following rules apply to the positive prescription, (a) The possession 
which is required for it must be peaceable, continuous (" continually 
and together," as the act of 161 7 has it), and uninterrupted, (b) The 
prescription runs de momento in momentum* (c) The person against 
whom the prescription runs must be^ major and sut juris — a rule 
which, as regards minority, was specially provided for by the act 
of 1617, andas regards other cases of incapacity by the application 
of the principles of the common law. Under the Conveyancing 
Act, however, it is provided that in all cases where the twenty 
years' prescription applies, the lapse of thirty years is to exclude 
any plea on the ground of minority or want of capacity. 

2. Negative Prescription. — This prescription was introduced by 
the act of 1469, c. 28, and substantially re-enacted by the act of 1474, 
c, 55. At first restricted to personal claims of debt, it was gradually 
extended in practice and ultimately' made applicable to heritable 
bonds and other heritable rights by the above-mentioned act of 1617. 
By the act of 1469 it is declared that the person having interest in 
an obligation must follow the same within the space of forty years 
and take document thereupon, otherwise it shall be prescribed. The 
negative prescription accordingly extinguishes in toto the right to 
demand performance of an obligation after forty years, the years 
being reckoned from the day on which fulfilment of the obligation 
can be first demanded. The lapse of this period of time creates a 
conclusive presumption — one incapable of being redargued — that 
the debt or obligation has been paid or fulfilled. But it must be 
kept in view that the negative prescription does not perse — without 
the operation of the positive — establish a right to heritable property 
(Erskine, B Inst. b. iii. tit. 7, % 8). As regards the character of the 
prescription, it is requisite, in the same way as in the case of the 
positive, that the years shall have run continuously and without 
interruption, i.e. without any act done on the part of the creditor 
which indicates his intention to keep alive the right. Such inter- 
ruption may, for instance, take place by the payment of interest 
on the debt, or citation of the debtor in an action for the debt, or 
by a claim being lodged in the debtor's sequestration. In the same 
way as in the positive, the currency of the negative prescription is 
suspended by the debtor being minor or nan valens agere. 

3. Shorter Prescriptions. — There are certain short prescriptions 
recognized by Scots law — corresponding to the limitations of English 
law — which operate not as^ extinguishing rights but as excluding 
the^ ordinary means of proving them. The following require to be 
noticed, (a)^ Vicennial prescription protecting a person who has been 
served as heir for twenty years against action by any other person 
claiming to be heir, (b) Decennial prescription requiring all actions 
by minors against their tutors and curators, and vice versa, to be 
prosecuted within ten years from the expiration of the guardianship. 
(c) Septennial prescription providing that no person bind himself, 
under certain exceptions, for and with another, conjunctly and 
severally, in any bond or contract for sums of money shall be bound 
for more than seven years after the date of the obligation. There 
are also other shorter prescriptions limiting rights of action in 
different matters as the sexennial, quinquennial and triennial. 

PRESENT, an adjective, adverb and substantive meaning 
that which is at hand or before one in place or in time. Also 
another substantive meaning a gift, and a verb meaning to bring 
into the presence of, to offer, to deliver. The verb is pronounced 
presint; the others present. The first group is due to the Latin 
pracsens, the present participle of pratesse, to be before one or 
at hand; from this participle was formed the verb pratsentare, to 
bring before one, exhibit, show. The sense of " gift " is due to

PRESENT ATIONISM— PRESS 



the O. Fr. phrase meitre en present a quelqiCun, to bring something 
into the presence of a person, to offer, give. The legal formal 
phrase " these presents " is common, especially in the form " know 
all men by these presents," as an opening to a deed, more particu- 
larly to a deed-poll which cannot be referred to as an " indenture." 
The phrase " these present words, documents, writings," &c. 
is an adaptation of a similar phrase in O.Fr. ces presentes (sc. 
ettres). As ecclesiastical terms " to present " or " presentation " 
are used of tbe " presenting " or nomination by the patron 
to the bishop of tbe person chosen by him to fill a vacant 
benefice. When the bishop is patron hq does not "present," 
but " collates." " Presentiment," foreboding, the feeling 
of something impending, must be distinguished in ety- 
mology; it is derived from the Lat. praesentire, to perceive 
beforehand. 

PRESENT ATIONISM (from Lat. prae-esse, praesens, present), 
a philosophical term used in various senses deriving from the 
general sense of the term " presentation." According to G. F. 
Stout (cf. Manual of Psychology, i. 57), presentations are " what- 
ever constituents or our total experience at any moment directly 
determine the nature of the object as it is perceived or thought of 
at that moment." In Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy, vol. ii., 
a presentation is " an object in the special form under which it 
is cognized at any given moment of perceptual or ideational 
process." This, the widest definition of the term, due largely 
to Professor James Ward, thus includes both perceptual and 
ideational processes. The term has, indeed, been narrowed 
so as to include ideation, the correlative " representation " 
being utilized for ideal presentation, but in general the wider 
use is preferred. When tbe mind is cognizing an object, the 
object " presents " itself to the senses or to thought in one 
of a number of different forms (e.g. a picture is a work of art, a 
saleable commodity, a representation of a house, &c). Pre- 
sentation is thus essentially a cognitive process. Hence the 
most important use of the term " present ationism," which is 
defined by Ward, in Mind, N.S. (1893), ii. 58, as "a doctrine 
the gist of which is that all the elements of psychical life are 
primarily and ultimately cognitive elements." This use takes 
precedence of two others: (1) that of Hamilton, for presentative 
as opposed to representative theories of knowledge, and (2) that 
of some later writers who took it as equivalent to phenomenon 
(q.v.). Ward traces the doctrine in his sense to Hume, to whom 
the mind is a " kind of theatre " in which perceptions appear 
and vanish continually (see Green and Grose edition of the 
Treatise, i. 534). The main problem is as to whether psychic 
activity is " presented " or not. Ward holds that it is not 
presented or presentable save indirectly. 

For the problems connected with Presentation and Presenta- 
tionism see especially the article Psychology and authorities there 
quoted. 

PRESIDENCY, an administrative unit of the Indian empire. 
The word is derived from the title of president or chief of the 
council of a principal factory under the early East India Company 
— a title which lasted until governors were appointed under act 
of parliament in 1784. It thence came to be applied to the three 
original provinces of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. It is now 
restricted to Madras and Bombay, in distinction to the lieu- 
tenant-governorships. In Anglo-Indian usage, " presidency " 
was also applied to the capital city as opposed to tbe country 
beyond, termed the " mofussil "; and this usage lingers in such 
phrases as " presidency town," " presidency magistrate," and 
" presidency college." 

PRESIDENT (Fr. president, from Lat. praesidens, post- 
Augustan Lat. for praeses, director, ruler, from praesidere, to 
sit in front of, preside), a style or title of various connotation, 
but always conveying the sense of one who presides. In classical 
Latin the title praeses, or president, was given to all governors 
of provinces, but was confined in the time of Diocletian to the 
procurators who, as lieutenants of the emperor, governed the 
smaller provinces. In this sense it survived in the middle ages. 
Du Cange gives instances from the capitularies of Charlemagne 
of the style praeses provinciae as applied to the count ; and later 



examples of praeses, or praesidens, as used of royal seneschals and 
other officials having jurisdiction under the Crown. 

In England the word survived late in this sense of royal 
lieutenant. Thus, John Co well, in his Interpreter of Words 
(1607) defines " President " as " used in Common Law for the 
King's lieutenant in any province or function; as President of 
Wales, of York, of Berwick. President of the King's Council." 
In some of the British North American colonies (New Hamp- 
shire, Pennsylvania, South Carolina) there was a president of 
the council, usually elected by the council; and when Pennsyl- 
vania and New Hampshire became states, one member of the 
Executive Council was called president. The chief (and single) 
executive bead in Delaware, South Carolina and New Hamp- 
shire (1 784-1 792) was called president. 

During the revolutionary struggle in America from 1774 
onwards, the presiding officer of the Continental Congress was 
styled "President" and when the present constitution of the 
United States was framed in 1787 (in effect 1789) the title of 
President was transferred to the head of the Federal government. 
" President •" thus became the accepted style for the elected 
chief of a modern republic, the example of the United States 
being followed by the South American republics, by France in" 
1849, and by Switzerland. 

In the simple sense of " one who presides " the word " president " 
preserved its meaning alongside the technical use implying royal 
delegation. . In this sense the New English Dictionary quotes its use 
by Chaucer (Troylus^ iv. 185) in 1374. In ecclesiastical terminology 
praesidens was sometimes used for the head of cathedral chapters, 
instead of dean or provost ; and it was sometimes the title given to 
the principal visitor of monasteries, notably in the reformed congre- 
gation of Cluny (Du Cange). In the United Kingdom the heads 
of many colleges are styled "president,*' the title being of consider- 
able antiquity in the case of one college at Cambridge (Queens', 
founded in 1448) and four at Oxford (St John's, Magdalen, Corpus 
Christi, Trinity). At five Cambridge colleges (Pembroke, Gonville 
and Caius, St Catherine's, St John's, Magdalene) the title " president" 
is borne by the second in authority, being the equivalent of " vice- 
master." In the United States president " is the usual style of 
the head of a college and also of a university wherever this has 
developed out of a single college. " President is also the style of 
persons elected to preside over the meetings of learned, scientific, 
literary and artistic academies and societies, e.g. the president of the 
Royal Academy (P.R.A.) in London; the title of the president of 
the Royal Society (P.R.S.) dates from its foundation in 1660. In 
the United States the style " president " is also given to the person 
who presides over the proceedings of financial, commercial and 
industrial corporations (banks, railways, &c), in Great Britain usually 
styled " chairman," but in the case of the Bank of England and 
certain other banks "governor." 

In Great Britain the title " president " is also borne by certain 
ministers of the Crown and certain judges, and preserves some of 
the ancient connotation of a royal lieutenancy explained above. 
Thus the style of " president " applied to the heads of the board of 
agriculture, local government board, board of education, board of 
trade, &c, which are all committees of the privy council, is derived 
from that of the lord president of the council, the representative 
of the king. The presidents of the court of session in Scotland, and 
of the probate and divorce division, &c. in England, also bear this 
style ultimately as representatives of the Crown. 

In France, besides the president of the republic, there are presi- 
dents of the senate and of the chamber of deputies. In Germany 
the word President is used in most of the English senses of 
11 president," e.g. of a corporation, society, assembly or political body. 
As a judicial title Prdsident is confined to the head of any one of the 
corporations (Kollegien) on the basis of which the judicial system 
of the empire is organized (Landgericht, Oberlandesgericht, Keichs- 
gericht), and must be distinguished from that of Vorsitzender (literally 
also praesidens), i.e. the judge (who may or may not be the Prdsident) 
selected to preside over a division of the court appointed to try 
particular cases. 

In Prussia Prdsident also retains its old sense of " governor," 
Oberprdsident being the title of the chief of the administration of a 
province, Prdsident that of the head of a government district 
(Regierungsbezirk). The consistories of the established Protestant 
Church are also presided over by a Prdsident, who is a royal official. 

PRESS (through Fr. presse from Lat. pressare, frequentative 
of pr enter e, to crush, squeeze, press), a word which appears in 
English in the 13th and 14th centuries with three particular 
1 The style "president " was in every -case exchanged for that 
of " governor " within a few years of the proclamation of the inde- 
pendence of the United States. The title " president " is no longer 
used for any governor under the British Crown, but relics of past 
usage survive in the " presidencies " of Madras and Bombay.

meanings, viz. (1) crowd or throng, often used of the mllie in 
a battle, (2) a shelved cupboard for books or clothes, and (3) 
an apparatus for exerting pressure on various substances, and 
for various purposes. The first meaning is still current, though 
usually it has a literary air; a specific use is the nautical one of 
" press of sail," i.e. as much sail as the wind will allow; cf. the 
similar use of " crowd." The second use has given way to other 
words, but is still the technical term in use in libraries, where the 
books bear " press-marks " specifying the case or shelf where 
they may be found. As a term for a machine or apparatus for 
exerting pressure, there are innumerable examples, usually with 
a qualifying word giving the purpose for which the pressure is 
applied, cither for attaining compression into a small space, 
or a required shape, or for extracting juices or liquids, or the 
methods adopted for exerting the pressure. The printing-press 
has given rise to obvious transferred uses of the word " press ": 
thus it is applied to an establishment for printing, e.g. the 
Clarendon Press, at Oxford, or the Pitt Press, at Cambridge, 
to a printing-house and to the staff which conduct the business, 
to the issue of printed matter and especially to its daily or 
periodical issue, hence newspapers and periodicals generally. 
According to the New English Dictionary this use originated in 
phrases such as " the Kberty of the press," " to WTite for the 
press," &c. The earliest quotation given is from the first 
number of the Dublin Press, 1 797. For the history of the liberty 
or freedom of the press see Press Laws; also Newspapers and 
Periodicals. For the punishment of " pressing " see Peine 
Forte et Dure. It is now recognized that " press " in " press 
gang," " to press," i.e. to force or compulsorily enlist men for 
naval or military service, is a word distinct from the above. It 
stands for the earlier " prest," and is ultimately due to French 
prtter, to lend (see Impressment). 

PRESSBURG (Hung. Pozsony, Lat. Posonium), a town of 
Hungary, capital of the county of the same name, 133 m. 
N.W. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1900); 61,537, about half of 
whom are Germans. Pressburg is picturesquely situated on 
the left bank of the Danube, at the base of the outlying spurs 
of the Little Carpathians, in a position of strategical importance 
near the Porta Hun gar ka. Pressburg was the capital of 
Hungary from 1541 until 1784, while the Hungarian parliament 
held its sittings here till 1848. One of the most conspicuous 
buildings of the town is the royal palace, situated on the Schloss- 
berg, a plateau 270 ft. above the Danube, which was destroyed 
by fire in 181 r and has since been in ruins. Other noteworthy 
buildings are the cathedral, a Gothic edifice of the 13th century, 
restored in 1861-1880, in which many of the Hungarian kings 
were crowned; the town hall, also a 13th-century building, 
several times restored, and containing an interesting museum; 
the Franciscan church, dating from 1272; and the law-courts, 
erected in 1783, where the sittings of parliament were held from 
1802 to 1848. The Grassalkowitch palace is now the residence 
of an archduke, and there is an archiepiscopal palace. Educa- 
tional establishments include an academy of jurisprudence, a 
military academy, a Roman Catholic and a Protestant seminary, 
a training school for female teachers, and several secondary and 
technical schools. A large business is carried on in wooden 
furniture, tobacco and cigars, paper, ribbons, leather wares, 
chemicals, liqueurs, confectionery and biscuits. There is, 
besides, a dynamite factory, which produces over 2,000,000 lb 
of explosives annually, a large cloth factory and several flour- 
mills. Trade in grain and wine is active. Besides the extensive 
traffic on the Danube, the town is also an important railway 
junction. The first railway line in Hungary was that from 
Pressburg to Tyrnau through the valley of the Waag. The 
town has many points of interest in its environs. About 
twenty-five minutes by steamer down the Danube, the exten- 
sive ruins of the castle of Theben (Hung. DMny), the former 
gate of Hungary, are situated at the point where the March, 
which forms the boundary between Austria and Hungary, 
falls into the Danube. Opposite on the left, bank is Hainburg, 
the gateway of Hungary from the Austrian side. Eastward 
and southward of Pressburg stretches a long and fertile plain, 



known as the Upper or Little Hungarian plain. It has an area 
of 2825 sq. m., of which two-thirds lay on the right bank of the 
Danube, and the whole is bounded by the rivers Neutra and 
Raab. In the extreme south-west of this plain is situated the 
lake of Ferto-Tava (Ger. Neasiedler See), which has an area 
of about 100 sq. m., but it is of varying size, and sometimes 
dries up in part. Eastward it is united with the extensive 
marsh called the Hansag, through which it is in communication 
with the river Raab and with the Danube. In the Roman 
period it was known as Petso or Pelso. In several places of 
the dry bed traces of prehistoric Jake-dwellings have been 
discovered. In conjunction with the regulation of the river 
Raab, and the drainage of the Hansag marsh, plans for the 
drainage of the lake have been proposed. 

Little is known of the early history of Pressburg, which was 
founded about 1000. It was soon strongly fortified, though it 
was captured by the king of Bohemia, Ottakar II., in 1271. 
It received many privileges from the Hungarian kings, especi- 
ally from the emperor Sigismund, and its strategic situation 
made it an important fortress. Sigismund held Imperial diets 
in the town. After the battle of Mohacs in 1 526 and the capture 
of Buda by the Turks, Pressburg became the capital of Hungary. 
Here in 1608 the Austrian and Hungarian malcontents concluded 
a treaty with the archduke Matthias, afterwards emperor, 
against their lawful sovereign, the emperor Rudolf II. In 1619 
the town was taken by Bethlen Gabor, but it was recovered 
by the Imperialists in 1621. In 1687 it was the scene of the 
session of the estates of Hungary during which the Hungarians 
renounced their right of choosing their own king and accepted 
the hereditary succession of the Habsburgs. Here also was 
held the diet of 1741 when the members swore to assist their 
sovereign, Maria Theresa, against Frederick the Great. In 
1 784 Buda took the place of Pressburg as the capital of Hungary, 
but the latter town continued to be the seat of the parliament 
until 1848. On the 26th of December 1805 peace was signed 
here between Napoleon and the emperor Francis I., and in 1809 
the town was bombarded by the French.

PRESSENS& EDMOND DEHAULT DE (1824-1891), French 
Protestant divine, was born at Paris on the 7th of January 
1824. He studied at Lausanne under Alexander Vinet, and at 
Halle and Berlin under F. A. G. Tholuck and J. A. W. Neandef, 
and in 1847 became pastor in the Evangelical Free Church at 
the chapel of Taitbout in Paris. He was a powerful preacher 
and a good political speaker; from 1871 he was a member of the 
National Assembly, and from 1883 a senator. In 1S90 he was 
elected a member of the Academy of Sciences. Pressense 
laboured for the revival of biblical studies. He contended 
that the Evangelical Church ought to be independent of the 
power of the state. He died on the 8th of April 1891. 

He founded in 1854 the Revue chretienne, and in 1866 the Bulletin 
theologique. His works include: Histoire des trots premiers silcles 
deViglise chrHienne (6 vols. 1856-1877; new ed. 1887-1889), L'£gli'se 
et la revolution francaise (1864 ; 3rd ed., 1889), Jesus-Christ, son tewps, 
sa vie t son ceuvre (against E. Renan, 1866; 7th ed. 1884), Les Origines, 
le problhne de la connaissance; le probUme cosmologique (1883; 2nd 
ed. 1887). See T. Roussel, Notice sur la vie et les ceuvres de Pressenst 
(1894). 

PRESS GANG, the popular name for the companies of officers 
and men who were commissioned to execute the warrants for 
the impressment of seamen in Great Britain (see Impressment). 
These bodies consisted of a captain, one or more lieutenants, 
and a band of trustworthy men. They were sent to seaports, 
or occasionally to inland towns where sailors were likely to be 
met when going from one coast to another. A " rendezvous " 
was opened, volunteers were enlisted, deserters arrested, and 
such " able bodied persons " as were liable to be pressed for 
service in the fleet were seized, and sent to the guard ships (q.v.). 

PRESS LAWS, the laws concerning the licensing of books

especially newspapers. The liberty of the press has always 
been regarded by modern political writers as of supreme import- 
ance. " Give me liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely 
according to conscience, above all other liberties," says Milton 
in the Areopagitica. 

At the present day the liberty of the press in English-speaking 
countries is a matter of merely historical importance. But 
this liberty was a plant of slow growth. Before the invention of 
printing the Church assumed the right to control the expression 
of all opinion distasteful to her. When the printing-press was 
invented German printers established themselves at various 
important centres of western Europe, where already numbers 
of copyists were employed in multiplying manuscripts. In 
1473 Louis XI. granted letters patent (giving the right of printing 
and selling books) to " Uldaric Quering " (Ulrich Gering), 
who three years earlier had set up a press in the Sorbonne (the 
theological faculty of the university at Paris), and before long 
Paris had more than fifty presses at work. The Church and 
universities soon found the output of, books beyond their 
control. In 1496 Pope Alexander VI. began to be restive, 
and in 1 501 he issued a bull against unlicensed printing, which 
introduced the principle of censorship. 1 Between 1524 and 
1548 the Imperial Diet in Germany drew up various stringent 
regulations; and in 1535 Francis I., in France, prohibited by 
edict, under penalty of death, the printing of books. This 
was too severe, however, and shortly afterwards the Sorbonne 
was given the right of deciding, a system which lasted to the 
Revolution. 

In England the authority of parliament was invoked to aid 
the ecclesiastical authority. There is an ordinance as early 
as 1382, 5 Ric. II. st. 2, c. 5 (not assented to by the Commons, 
but appearing upon the parliament roll), directed against 
unlicensed preachers. After the invention of printing the 
ecclesiastical censorship was still asserted, but only as collateral 
with the censorial rights of the Crown, claimed by virtue of its 
general prerogative. After the Reformation the greater part 
of the rights of censorship passed to the Crown, which at the 
same time assumed the power of granting by letters patent the 
right of printing or selling books as a monopoly. The grant, 
if made to the author himself, was an equivalent of copyright; 
if made to a person other than the author, it seems to have 
always been subject to the author's copyright as it existed at 
common law. 

Censorship was either restrictive or corrective, i.e. it interfered 
to restrict or prevent publication, or it enforced penalties after 
publication. Repression of free discussion was regarded as so 
necessary a part of government that Sir Thomas More in his 
Utopia makes it punishable with death for a private individual 
to criticize the conduct of the ruling power. Under Mary print- 
ing was confined to members of the Stationers' Company, 
founded by royal charter in 1556. Under Elizabeth the Star 
Chamber assumed the right to confine printing to London, 
Oxford and Cambridge, to limit the number of printers and 
presses, to prohibit all publications issued without • proper 
licence, and to enter houses to search for unlicensed presses 
and publications (Order of 1585, Strype's Whit gift, app. 94). 
The search for unlicensed presses or publications was entrusted 
to an officer called the " messenger of the press." In 1637 
was issued an order of the Star Chamber forbidding the importa- 
tion of books printed abroad to the scandal of religion or the 

1 The principle of the censorship is still uncompromisingly main- 
tained by the Roman Catholic Church ; and this, though in general 
binding only in foro conscientiae, has necessarily had considerable 
importance in states which recognize the papacy as an independent 
power relations with which are established by concordat. Thus 
in Italy , under the Sardinian constitution of 1848, Bibles, catechisms 
and liturgical words had to be licensed by the bishop. The principle 
of the censorship, consecrated anew in Pope Pius IX.'s Syllabus of 
1864, was reaffirmed in the apostolic constitution Ojjiciorum ef 
Leo XIII. and in 1907 in the encyclical Pascendi of Pius X. This 
last expresses " the highest esteem for this institution of censors " 
and orders censors to be appointed in all episcopal curias for the 
revision of books intended tor publication, at the same time direct- 
ing that their names shall not be made known to the authors of 
the books condemned. (See also Inhex Librorum Prohibitorum.) 



Church or the government, and the printing of any book not 
first lawfully licensed. Law books were to be licensed by one 
of the chief justices or the chief baron, books of history and 
state affairs by one of the secretaries of state, of heraldry by the 
earl marshal, of divinity, philosophy, poetry and other subjects 
by the archbishop of Canterbury or the bishop of London, 
or the chancellors or vice-chancellors of the universities. 
There were to be only twenty master printers and four letter- 
founders. The punishment was at the discretion of the court 
(Rushworth, Historical Collections, vol: iii. app. 306). The 
same principle of press restriction was carried out by the Long 
Parliament after the abobtion of the Star Chamber, and it was 
an ordinance of that body issued in 1643 that called forth 
Milton's Areopagitica, a Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed 
Printing, itself an unlicensed book. The parliament appointed 
committees for printing, who appointed licensers, but the licens- 
ing was really left in a great measure to the wardens of the 
Stationers' Company. At the Restoration Sir John Birkenhead 
acted as licenser, appointed apparently under the general 
prerogative. It was, no doubt, too, under the general pre- 
rogative that Charles IL, by a proclamation in 1660, called in 
and suppressed Milton's Dcfensio pro populo anglicano. Then 
followed the Licensing Act of 1662 (1.3 & 14 Car. II. c. ^), 
limited to two years. The provisions as to importation of books, 
the appointment of licensers, and the number of printers and 
founders were practically re-enactments of the similar pro- 
visions in the Star Chamber order of 1637. Printing presses 
were not to be set up without notice to the Stationers' Company. 
A king's messenger had power by warrant of the king or a 
secretary of state to enter and search for unlicensed presses 
and printing. Severe penalties by fine and imprisonment were 
denounced against offenders. The act was successively renewed 
up to 1679. Under the powers of the act Sir Roger L'Estrange 
was appointed licenser, and the effect of the supervision was that 
practically the newspaper press was reduced to the London 
Gazette. The objections made to lines 594-599 of the first book 
of Paradise Lost by the archbishop of Canterbury's chaplain, 
acting as licenser, are well known. The act expired in 1679, 
and for the remainder of the reign of Charles II. , as in the reign 
of George III., the restrictions on the press took the form of 
prosecutions for libel. In 1685 the Licensing Act was renewed 
for seven years (1 Jac. II. c. 8, § 15). No mention of the liberty 
of the press was made in the Bill of Rights. On the expiration 
of the Licensing Act in 1692 it was continued till the end of the 
existing session of parliament (4 & 5 Will, and Mary, c. 24, § 14). 
In 1695 the Commons refused to renew it. The immediate 
effect of this was to lay authors open to the attacks of literary 
piracy, and in 1709 the' first Copyright Act (8 Anne, c. 19) 
was enacted for their protection. The power of a secretary 
of state to issue a warrant, whether general or special, for the 
pu rpose of searching for and seizing the author of a libel or the 
libellous papers themselves — a power exercised by the Star 
Chamber and confirmed by the Licensing Act — was still asserted, 
and was not finally declared illegal until the case of Entick v. 
Carrington in 1765 (St. Tr. xix. 1030). In 1776 the House of 
Commons came to a resolution in accordance with this decision. 
The compulsory stamp duty on newspapers was abandoned 
in 1855 (18 Vict. c. 27), the duty on paper in 1861 (24 Vict. c. 
20) , the optional duty on newspapers in 1870 (33 & 34 Vict. c. 38) . 
From that time the English press may be said to date its complete 
freedom, which rests rather upon a constitutional than a legal 
foundation. It is not confirmed by any provision of the supreme 
legislative authority, as is the case in many countries. A 
declaration in favour of the liberty of the press is usually a 
prominent feature in the written constitutions of foreign states. 

The few existing restrictions on the liberty of the press are pre- 
sumed to be imposed for the public benefit. They are in some cases 
of great historical interest. The rights of private persons are in 
general sufficiently protected in one direction by the law of Libel 
(3.V.), in another by the law of Copyright (q.v.\ while the criminal 
law provides for the cases of press offences against morality, public 
justice, &c. Thus the courts have power to punish summarily as 
a contempt the publication of comments upon proceedings subjudice

or reflections upon the conduct of judicial officers. (See Contempt 
of Court.) The last relic of the censorship before publication is 
to be found in the licensing of stage plays. By 6 & 7 Vict. c. 68 no 
new plays or additions to old plays can be acted for hire at any 
theatre in Great Britain until they have been submitted to the lord 
chamberlain, who may forbid any play or any part of a play. The 
penalty for acting a play before it has been allowed or after it has 
been disallowed is a sum not exceeding £50 for every offence and the 
forfeiture of the licence of the theatre in which the offence occurred. 
This jurisdiction is exercised by an official of the lord chamberlain's 
department called the " examiner of stage plays." The last relic 
of the monopoly of printing formerly granted to licensees of the 
Crown is found in the exclusive right of the king's printer and the 
universities of Oxford and Cambridge to print .the Bible 1 and 
the Book of Common Prayer, and of the king s printer to print acts 
of parliament and other state documents. The privileges of 
the universities are confirmed by 13 Eliz. c. 29. The rights of the 
king's printer are protected by severe penalties. A maximum term 
of seven years' penal servitude is incurred by any person who prints 
any act of parliament or other government document, falsely pur- 
porting to be printed by the king's printer or under the authority 
of His Majesty's stationery office (8 & 9 Vict. c. 113; 45 Vict. c. 9). 
The rights of the printers of the journals of either house of parliament 
are protected by 8 & 9 Vict. c. 113. The publication of parliamentary 
debates in any form by any other persons than the printers of the 
journals of the two houses is still in theory a breach of privilege, 
but in practice they have been fully reported since 1771. The other 
restrictions upon the press are to [a great extent those imposed for 
police purposes. By 32 & 33 Vict. c. 24 (confirming in part previous 
enactments applying to Great Britain) the printer of any paper or 
book for profit is required under penalties to print thereon his name 
and address or the name of a university press, and is to keep a copy 
of everything printed, with a few except ions.^ Penalties must be 
sued for within three months, and no proceeding for penalties can 
be begun unless in the name of the attorney-general or solicitor- 
general of England or the lord advocate of Scotland. By the News- 
paper Libel and Registration Act 1881 (44 & 45 Vict. c. 60), which 
applies to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, newspaper 
proprietors are, except in the case of joint-stock companies, to be 
registered and to make annual returns of the title of the newspaper 
and the names of all the proprietors, with their occupations, places 
of business and places of residence. By the Corrupt Practices 
Prevention Acts 1883 and 1884 (46 & 47 Vict. c. 51, § 18, and 
47 & 48 Vict. c. 70, § 14), the name and address of the printer must 
be printed on all bills, placards, &c, referring to a parliamentary or 
municipal election. By 6 & 7 Vict. c. 68, § 7, the name and place 
of aboae of a manager of a theatre are to be printed on every play-bill 
announcing a representation at such theatre. Offences against 
decency by the press are provided for by 20 & 2 1 Vict. c. 83 ; 25 & 26 
Vict. c. 101, § 251 (for Scotland), and 2 & 3 Vict. c. 47, § 54 (for the 
metropolis). The importation of obscene literature into the United 
Kingdom is forbidden by 39 &40 Vict. c. 36, § 42. By the Larceny 
Act 1861, any person who prints or publishes an advertisement 
offering a reward for the return of stolen goods without questions 
asked is subject to a penalty (24 & 25 Vict. c. 96, § 102). This penalty 
cannot, however, be sued for without the sanction of the attorney- 
general or solicitor-general of England or Ireland (33 & 34 Vict. c. 65). 
The advertisement in the United Kingdom of foreign or illegal 
lotteries Is prohibited by 6 & 7 Will. IV. c. 66, betting advertisements 
by 16 & 17 Vict. c. 119, § 7, and 37 Vict. c. 15. 

The right of an author or publisher to the full profits of his under- 
taking was at one time restricted by the Copyright Act of Anne 
(8 Anne, c. 19, § 4), by which the archbishop of Canterbury and other 
authorities were empowered to lower the price of a book upon com-, 
plaint that the price was unreasonable. The only restriction of 
the kind now existing is the obligation of delivering (without request) 
to the British Museum a copy of any work published within the 
United Kingdom, and of delivering (on request) copies for the use 
of the university libraries at Oxford and Cambridge, the library of 
the faculty of advocates at Edinburgh, and the library of Trinity 
College, Dublin (5 & 6 Vict. c. 45, §§ 6-10). 

Scotland. — Printing became, as in England, a royal monopoly. 
The exclusive right of printing was granted by James IV. to Walter 
Chepman, who printed the first book in Scotland. The monopoly 
of printing acts of the Scottish parliament was granted by James V. 
to the printer chosen by the clerk register and specially licensed by 
the king (1540, c. 127). Printers are forbidden by 1551, c. 27, to 
print, whether in Latin or English, without licence from ordinaries 
deputed in that behalf by the Crown. No book treating of religion 
or of the kirk was to be "printed without a licence from the general 
assembly (1646, e. 164), or of the kingdom without a licence from 
one of the judges or the secretary (c. 165). The council were 
empowered to prohibit presses at their discretion by the order of 
the 30th of March 1655. The importation of " famous " books and 
libels in defence of the pope was prohibited by 1581, c. 106. Press 

1 The monopoly of the king's printer docs not extend to any 
translation other than the Authorized Version, and not to that if 
it be accompanied by new notes or marginal readings. 



offences were treated with the utmost severity. By 1585, c. 1, the 
author of a libellous writing against the king was punishable with 
death. It is scarcely necessary to say that since the union the press 
of Scotland has enjoyed no less liberty than that of England. 

In the case of Bibles, Old and New Testaments, Psalm Books, 
the Book of Common Prayer, the Confession of Faith, and the Larger 
and Shorter Catechisms a licence for printing is still required. The 
licensing authority is the lord advocate, but all proposed publications 
are submitted for approval to the body officially known as " His 
Majesty's sole and only Master Printers in Scotland," consisting 
of the lord advocate, the solicitor-general, the moderator of the 
general assembly, and four other members. A licence is also required 
for printing acts of parliament; but a general licence granted in 1848 
to a firm of printers in Edinburgh is still operative, and their publica- 
tions are not submitted for approval. As its work is practically 
confined to Bibles and the other religious publications enumerated, 
the above-mentioned body commonly receives the name of the Bible 
Board. 

Ireland. — By the Prevention of Crime Act 1882 (45 & 46 Vict, 
c. 25), the lord-lieutenant was empowered to order the seizure of 
any newspaper appearing to contain matter inciting to the commis- 
sion of treason or of any act of violence or intimidation (§13). He 
may also by warrant direct the search for and seizure of any papers 
or documents suspected to be used or to be intended to be used for 
the purpose of or in connexion with any secret society existing for 
criminal purposes (§ 14). 

The British Dominions. — In the British colonies the press is as 
free as it is in England. Each colony has its special legislation on 
the subject for police and revenue purposes. Where there is a 
government printer, his monopoly is protected by the Documentary 
Evidence Act 1868 (31 & 32 Vict. c. 37), which imposes a maximum 
penalty of five years' penal servitude upon any person printing a 
copy of any proclamation, order, or regulation which falsely purports 
to have been printed by the government printer, or to be printed 
under the authority pi the legislature of any British colony or 
possession. The act is, however, subject to any law made by the 
colonial legislature. 

India. — During the governor-generalship of Lord Lytton was 
passed the " Act_ for the better control of publications in Oriental 
languages," Act ix. of 1878. (1) By this act copies of newspapers 

Cublished out of British India were liable to forfeiture and seizure 
y warrant throughout the whole of British India if the papers 
contained any words, signs or visible representations likely to excite 
disaffection to the government established by law in British India, 
or antipathy between any persons of different races, castes, religions 
or sects in British India. The governor-general might by notifica- 
tion in the Gazette of India t exclude newspapers, books, &c, from 
British India. (2) In places to which the act was extended by order 
of the governor-general in council a magistrate might require the 
printer and publisher of a newspaper to enter into a bond, with a 
deposit, not to. publish a newspaper containing " any words, signs," 
&c. (as in 1 ), or to use or attempt to use it for the purpose of extortion 
or threat. The consequences of offending were forfeiture of the 
deposit, papers, press, &c. Books used for the illegal purposes above 
mentioned were subject to forfeiture, but no bond or deposit was 
required previous to publication of books, as in the case of news- 
papers. 

This act, which remained in force until 19 10, was found, owing 
principally to the restriction of its operation to newspapers published 
in the vernacular, to be ineffective in coping with the spread of news 
sheets exciting disaffection amongst the natives towards the govern- 
ment of India. It was consequently repealed and replaced by an 
act of February 1910, which applies to all newspapers published after 
the act. The deposit requiring to be made is now obligatory on all 
new printing-presses, whether issuing a newspaper or not, and 
independently of the deposit on the newspaper. The requirement 
of a formal bond has been abolished. There are provisions for 
forfeiture of the deposit and confiscation of the press on repetition 
of the offence. The 1910 act gives power to the authorities to open 
postal packets, other than letters, suspected of containing seditious 
matter, and requiresthe printer of a newspaper to deposit with the 
government two copies of each issue at the time of publication. It 
includes a long list of offences incitement to which is punishable 
under the act, and in giving power to stop a seditious newspaper 
after conviction, and in fixing responsibility on the actual pnnters 
of seditious matter, has considerably strengthened the power of 
the law. 

* Egypt. — The press is subject to a special law (The Press Law of 
1 88 1) and to certain articles of the penal code which define press 
offences and prescribe penalties (botn fine and imprisonment) for 
them. Owing to the capitulations, which are in force in Egypt as 
part of the Ottoman Empire, the penal code cannot be applied to 
foreign subjects, and its application had not (up to 1910) been found 
sufficient to repress abuses. The probable result of strengthening 
the law would be that conductors of native papers desirous of 
indulging in violent language or sedition would engage a foreign 
subject as nominal proprietor or editor and thereby escape local 
jurisdiction. The Press Law of 1881 is a more powerful instrument 
than the penal code, inasmuch as there are decisions of the mixed 



302 



PRESS LAWS 



tribunals that that law is, in principle, applicable to foreigners. 
By this law registration of newspapers is obligatory, and the govern- 
ment has power of control, defined in art, 13 as follows: "In the 
interests of public order, of religion or of morality, every newspaper 
or periodical can be suspended or suppressed by order of the minister 
of the interior after two warnings, or, without previous warning, 
by a decision of the council of ministers. Each warning may be 
accompanied by a fine of from £E5 to £E20." If a newspaper or 
periodical which has been suppressed continues to ■ appear, the 
responsible parties can be fined, and the printing-press which issues 
the suppressed publication can be closed by order of the minister 
of the interior. The closure or seizure of the printing-press would, 
however, in the case of a foreigner require the co-operation of his 
consul. 

This law was from about 1900 allowed to fall into disuse. Owing 
to the excesses of the Arabic newspapers the law was revived in the 
early part of 1909, but was applied with great moderation. During 
the year two native papers were warned and one was suppressed. 
The tribunals remained alone competent to inflict any penalty (apart 
from suppression and seizure of the printing-press) more severe than 
a fipe of £E20, and in 1909 under the penal code the editor of one 
native paper was sentenced to a year's imprisonment and the editor 
of another to three months' imprisonment. (See Sir Eldon Gorst's 
reports on Egypt for 1908 and 1909, specially Egypt No. 1, iqoq, 
PP- 3-5.) 

The United States. — The first constitutions of Pennsylvania, Dela- 
ware, Maryland and North Carolina, enacted in 1776, are interesting 
as containing the earliest declarations of any legislative authority 
in favour of the liberty of the press. The same principle was after- 
wards adopted in the constitution of the United States. The acts 
of Congress dealing with the press are not numerous, as each state 
has for the^ most part its own legislation on the subject, dealing 
generally with, among other matters, the registration of newspapers, 
the monopoly of the state printer, and the right of giving the truth 
in evidence in defence to proceedings for libel. The act of the 18th 
of August 1856 forbids diplomatic or consular officers of the United 
States to correspond with any foreign newspaper in regard to the 
affairs erf a foreign state. The act of the 3rd of March 1873 prohibits 
the printing and circulation of obscene literature. Legislation by 
Congress has provided that all printing (unless otherwise ordered 
by law) for the Senate and House of Representatives and the 
executive and judicial departments, shall be done by the govern- 
ment printer. 

Austria-Hungary. — In the Austrian Empire, which from 1804 to 
1867 embraced Hungary also, the press laws under Metternich's 
regime were extremely severe. By the penal code of 1808 all 
printing had to be licensed, under heavy penalties, and in 1810 two 
censors were appointed. In short, the press had no shadow of liberty. 
During the revolution of 1848-1849 the principle of the freedom of 
the press was established, but the censorship was restored in 1852 and 
not abolished until 1863. The actual press laws of Austria are based 
on the press law of the 17th of December 1862 as modified by later 
supplementary enactments. In principle the freedom of the press 
was secured by art. 13 of the constitution of the 21st of December 
1867. In practice, however, it was^ still restricted by the obligation 
on newspaper proprietors to deposit " caution money " {Kautions- 
zwang) with the authorities, and the retention of the government 
stamp on newspapers. The caution money was abolished by a press 
law of the 9th of July 1894, and the stamp by that of the 27th of 
December 1899. The police, however, still have the right, either 
on their own initiative or under the, instructions of the public 
prosecutor {Staatsanwalt) , " provisionally " to confiscate printed 
matterwhich in their opinion offends against the terms of the press 
law or is contrary to the public interest. The public prosecutor has, 
within eight days, to justify this action in court, either by proceeding 
against those responsible for the publication, or by proving the 
published matter is offensive and ought to be suppressed. This 
latter^ " objective " procedure (objektives Verfahren) is peculiar to 
Austria and obviously places vast powers of control in the hands 
of the authorities. In 1902' the government introduced a bill 
greatly modifying these and other provisions of the press law in a 
liberal sense, but the bill was postponed to more urgent matters. 

In Hungary the liberty of the press was secured by art. 18 of 
the constitution of 1848, which was restored in 1867. Under this 
the censorship was abolished ; but, in addition to provision for the 
cases of libel, incitement to violence and crime, &c, the law also 
provided penalties for certain political press offences (§§ 6-8), i.e. 
attacks on the king or members of his family, incitements to (a) the 
dissolution of the territorial unity of the state or of the dynastic 
link with Austria; (6) the forcible alteration of the constitution; 
(c) disobedience to^ lawful authorities; (d) commission of crime. 
Press offences are tried by special jury courts. Under the Criminal 
Code of 1878 (§§ 170-174) further offences were made subject to 
penalty, including " direct incitement of one class of the popu- 
lation, one nationality or religious denomination to hatred of 
another," instigation against the constitution and parliament, and 
glorification of any one who has suffered punishment for such 
offences. " Direct incitement " (§ 172), was subsequently inter- 
preted by the curia to mean "any spoken or written word . . . 



which is capable of producing in another hatred against a 
nationality, &c." 

The result of these provisions has been that liberty of the press 
has existed in practice only for the Magyars, constant prosecutions 
having been directed against the editors and proprietors of publica- 
tions giving voice to the grievances of the other Hungarian races, 
conviction being all but inevitable owing to the special juries (due 
to the high property qualification) being almost exclusively composed 
of members of the dominant race. 

In Transylvania, where the old stringent Austrian press law of 
1852 is still in force, the public prosecutor has discretionary powers 
to confiscate obnoxious literature, powers freely used against the 
Rumanian press. (See R. W. Seton Watson, Racial Problems in 
Hungary, London, 1908, pp. 293 sqq.) 

Belgium. — It was the prosecution of political writers by the Dutch 
government that directly led to the independence of Belgium in 
1830. By the Belgian constitution of the 7th of February 1831, art. 
18, it io declared that the press is free, that censorship shall never 
again be established, that sureties cannot be exacted from writers, 
editors or printers, and that when the author is known and domiciled 
in Belgium the printer or bookseller cannot be prosecuted. By 
art. 98 press offences are to be tried by jury. The penal law of the 
press is contained in the decree of the 20th of July 1831, made 
perpetual in 1833. By this law it is made an offence, apart from 
the penal code, (1) to incite to the commission of a crime by placards 
or printed writings in a public meeting; (2) to attack the obligatory 
force of the laws, or to incite to disobedience of them ; (3) to attack 
the constitutional authority or inviolability of the king, the con- 
stitutional authority of the dynasty, or the authority and rights 
of the chambers. Every copy of a journal must bear the name of 
the printer and the indication of his domicile in Belgium. Proceed- 
ings for offences against the law must be taken in some cases within 
three months, in others within a year. 

Denmark. — Press offences were at one time punished with great 
severity. By the code of Christian V. (1683) libel was punished with 
infamy and hard labour for life, and, if against a magistrate, with 
death. Censorship was abolished and the press declared free bv 




unless after judicial proceedings. 
> France. — The government began early to impose stringent restric- 
tions upon printing. An edict of Henry II. in 1559 made it punish- 
abte with death to print without authority. The university of Paris 
originally claimed the right of licensing new theological works, a 
jurisdiction vested in the Crown by an ordinance of 1566. 
Offences against religion were severely punished by the secular 
authorities.^ Thus the parliament of Toulouse sent Vanini to 
the stake in 16 19 for the crime of publishing a heretical work. 
A few years later, in 1626, Cardinal Richelieu declared it a 
capital offence to publish a work against religion or the state. 
In 1723 appeared a regulation forbidding any but licensed 
booksellers to deal in books. Many later regulations were 
directed against unlicensed presses, the employment of more 
than a certain number of workmen, &c. At the Revolution all 
these restrictions were abolished, and the Assembly declared it 
to be the right of every citizen to print and publish his opinions. 
This new liberty quickly needed a check, which was attempted as 
early as 1791, but no effectual restraint was imposed until the law 
of the 5th of February 18 10 established a direction of the press. 
The charter of Louis XVIII. in 18 14 gave liberty to the press in 
express terms, but restrictions soon followed. In 18 19 a system 
of sureties (cautionnements) replaced the censorship. The Revolu- 
tion of 1830 was caused by, inter alia, one of the ordinances of St 
Cloud (July 25, 1830) for suspension of the liberty of the press. 
Restrictions on the liberty were removed for the time in 1830 and 
1852, only to be succeeded as usual by the press laws of 1835 and 
1852. During the Second Empire government prosecutions for libel 
were used as a powerful engine against the press. The proceedings 
against Montalembert in 1858 are a well-known instance. Between 
1858 and 1866 many newspapers were suppressed by proclamation. 
With the republic liberty of the press was completely re-established. 
A decree of the 27th of October 1870 submitted press offences to trial 
by jury. 1 The law of the 29th of July 1881, by which the French 
press is now regulated, begins by asserting the liberty of the press 
and of bookselling. The principal limitations of this liberty are 
the prohibition to publish criminal proceedings before hearing in 
public, or lists of subscriptions for indemnifying an accused person, 
and the power of forbidding the entrance of foreign newspapers under 
certain circumstances. The order of responsibility for printed 
matter is (1) the manager or editor, (2) the author, (3) the printer, 
(4) the vender or distributor. The printer and the vender, however, 
can only be punished for acts not falling within their proper functions. 
Proceedings for breaches of the law must be taken within three 
months. As to taxation, the decree of the 5th of September 1870 
abolished the stamp duty upon newspapers, but it is still imposed

upon public notices (affiches) other than those of public authorities. 
None but the notices of public authorities may be printed on white 
paper. 

Germany. — Censorship was introduced by the diet of Spires in 
1529. From that time till 1848 there were numerous restrictions 
on the liberty of the press. One of the most important was a 
resolution of the diet of the German confederation, passed on the 
20th of September 1819 as a sequel to the Carlsbad decrees (q.v.) t 
by which newspapers were subject to licence and police supervision 
in each state. Liberty dates, as in Austria and Italy, from 1848. 
Soon after that year, however, it became necessary to establish press 
laws in most of the German states, as in Bavaria in 1850, Prussia and 
Baden in 1851. Since the establishment of the new empire censorship 
has disappeared. By art. 74 of the constitution of the empire (1871) 
every one attacking the empire or its officers through the press is 
liable to punishment in his own state. By art. 4 the laws relating 
to th2 press are under imperial and not local control. The press 
law of the 7th of May 1874 is therefore in force throughout the whole 
empire. At its beginning it affirms the liberty of the press. Its 
main provisions are these: The name and address of the printer 
must appear on all printed matter. Newspapers and 'periodicals 
must in addition bear the name of some one person, domiciled in 
the empire, as responsible editor, and p. copy of every number must 
be deposited with the police authorities of the district in which it 
is published. Foreign periodicals may be excluded by proclamation 
of the Imperial chancellor for two years, if twice within the year 
they have been guilty of certain offences against the penal code. 
Criminal proceedings are not to be reported while still subjudice. 
The order of responsibility for offences is the same as in France. 
Proceedings must be taken within six months. In certain cases 
printed matter may be seized without the order of a court. This 
may take place where (1) the publication does not bear the name of 
printer or editor, (2) military secrets are revealed in time of war, 
(3) justice would be defeated by the publication not being immedi- 
ately seized. A judicial tribunal is to decide at once upon the legality 
of the seizure. The presslaw is not to affect regulations made in 
time of war or internal disturbance. A temporary law passed in 
1878 gave the police large powers in the case of socialistic publica- 
tions. Only offences involving heavy penalties are tried by jury. 
The proposal of the Reichstag that all press offences should be so 
tried was rejected by the governments, except as regards those states 
(Bavaria, Wiirttemberg, Baden, Oldenburg) where this principle 
was already in force. 

Greece. — Under King Otto censorship was exercised up to 1844. 
By the constitution of the 18th of March 1844 every one may 
publish his thoughts by means of the press, observing the laws of 
the state. The press is free, and censorship (KoyoKpiala) is not 
permitted. Responsible editors^ publishers and printers of news- 
papers are not required to deposit money on the ground of surety. 
Publishers of newspapers must be Greek citizens (art. 10). The 
legislature may exclude reporters from its sittings in certain cases 
(art. 48). Press offences are to be tried by jury, except when they 
deal only with private life (art. 93). 

Holland. — The press has been free since the existence of the 
present kingdom of the Netherlands, which dates from 1815. 
Liberty of the press is expressly secured by art. 8 of the constitu- 
tion of 1848. By art ; 286 of the penal code seditious books and 
newspapers may be seized. By art. 283 of the same code and by a 
royal decree of the 25th of January 1814 the name of the printer 
must appear upon newspapers. Press offences are not tried by 
jury. 

Italy. — By art, 27 of the political code of Sardinia, granted by 
Charles Albert on the 4th of March 1848, and still in force, the 
press is free, but abuses of the liberty are restrained by law. The 
present press law of Italy is contained in the law of the 26th of 
March 1848^ as altered by later enactments. Everything printed 
in typographical characters, or by lithography or any similar means, 
must indicate the place and the date of printing and the name of 
the printer. A copy of everything printed must be deposited with 
certain officials and at certain libraries. Before the publication of 
any newspaper or periodical, notice of the intended publication 
must be given at the office of the secretary of state for internal 
affairs. The notice must contain (1) a declaration of the legal 
qualification of the person intending to publish, whether as pro- 
prietor or editor, (2) the nature of the publication, and (3) the name 
and residence of the responsible editor. Every newspaper is bound 
to insert gratuitously a^ contradiction or explanation of any charge 
made against a person in its columns. For contravention of these 
and other regulations there is a statutory penalty not exceeding 
1000 lire (£40). The publication of a newspaper may be suspended 
until the payment of a fine. The publication of parliamentary 
•debates is permitted. Press offences are tried by a jury of twelve. 
By a law of the nth of May 1877 !t is f ° rb "iaen to publish any 
indication of the way in which individual judges or jurors voted in 
their deliberations. 

Norway. — The liberty of the press is secured by art, 100 of the 
constitution of 1814. No one can be punished for any writing 
unless he.or some one by his instigation, offend against the state, 
law, religion ^ or decency, or make infamous accusations against 
•any one. Criticism of the government is expressly permitted. 



Ottoman Empire. — By art. 12 of the constitution of the 23rd of 
December 1876 the press was recognized as free, subject to the 
limits imposed by law. The constitution was, however, " sus- 
pended," and a rigorous censorship was enforced, under the direction 
of Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid II., until the revolution of 1908. 

Portugal. — It is stated by Braga and others that a free press 
existed up to the establishment of the Inquisition, and that Gil 
Vicente (d. 1536) was the last writer who dared to express his 
thoughts freely. At a later period Bocage was imprisoned for 
writings displeasing to the authorities. Boards of censorship 
under the names of the " Real mesa censoria," or the " Mesa do 
desembargo do paco," assumed to license publications. Liberty 
of the press was, however, finally secured, and censorship limited, 
by art. 7 of the constitution grantecl by John VI. in 182 1. By 
art. 8 a special tribunal was constituted in both Portugal and 
Brazil to protect the liberty of printing. The censorship was con- 
fined to that exercised by the bishops over theological or dogmatic 
works. The debates in the legislature and proceedings in the courts 
of justice are not generally reported* 

Rumania. — By the constitution of the 30th of June 1866, art. 5, 
Rumanians enjoy liberty of the press. By art. 2± the constitution 
guarantees to all the liberty of communicating and publishing ideas 
through the press, every one being liable for abuse in cases deter- 
mined by the penal code. Press offences are to be tried by jury. 
Censorship is abolished, and is never to be re-established. No 
previous authorization is necessary for the publication of newspapers. 
No sureties are to be demanded from journalists, writers, editors 
or printers. The press is not to be subjected to regulation of ad- 
vertisements. No newspaper or publication is to be suspended or 
suppressed. Every author is responsible for his writings; in default 
of the author, the manager or editor is responsible. Every news- 
paper must have a responsible manager in the possession of civil 
and political rights. 

Russia. — The position of the Russian press generally was, previously 
to the revolution of 1905, regulated by a law of the 6th of April 1865. 
The effect of that law was to exempt from preventive censorship (if 
published in St Petersburg or Moscow) all newspapers, periodicals 
and original works and translations not exceeding a certain number 
of pages, and (wherever published) all government publications, 
matter printed by academies, universities and scientific bodies, 
and maps, plans, and charts. Everything printed and published 
that did not fall within any of these categories had, before issue 
to the public, to be submitted for the approval of government 
censors stationed in different parts of the empire. The minister 
of the interior had power to dispense with the preventive censorship 
in the case of provincial newspapers and periodicals. In St Peters- 
burg and Moscow the periodical press was subject to corrective 
censorship for infringement of the numerous restrictive regulations 
contained in the code, and supplemented at times by secret instruc- 
tions from the minister of the interior to editors and publishers. 
Apart from the code, the sustained display of a spirit hostile to the 
government rendered the publisher of a periodical liable to punish- 
ment. The penalties established by the law of 1865 for offences 
against the press regulations consisted in the infliction of a series 
of warnings published in the Official Gazette. A first warning 
merely enjoined morecare for the future; a second was followed by 
suspension for a certain period, sometimes by a prohibition to insert 
advertisements; a third by suppression, and perhaps prosecution of 
the offending conductor. By Imperial ukaz of the 2nd of June 1872 
the jurisdiction of the judicial tribunals over press offences was 
practically transferred to the minister of the interior, except in the 
case of violation of private rights, as by libel. The law of 1865 was 
modified in 1874 by a regulation to the effect that all publications 
appearing at longer intervals than one week should be submitted 
to the central board of censors. _ This applied to all periodicals that 
had been formerly published without preventive censorship. By a 
ukaz issued in 1881 a committee of four members was entrusted with 
the decision of all masters relating to the press submitted to it by 
the minister of the interior. The strictest supervision was exercised 
oyer the foreign press, periodical and otherwise. None but a few 
privileged individuals, such as membersof the royal family, foreign 
diplomatists, and editors of newspapers in the capital, might receive 
foreign publications free of censorship. The censorship consisted 
in blackening out, and sometimes in the excision, of whole columns 
and sheets of publications that might be deemed pernicious. Only 
such periodicals as were placed on a list approvea by the board of 
censors were allowed to be received through the post office by non- 
privileged persons. Telegraphic messages to newspapers were 
subject to strict censorship. The Russian telegraphic press agency 
is under official management. 

Full liberty of the press was guaranteed by the Imperial ukaz of 
the 17th of October 1905, and though no special legislation followed 
the censorship was for a time de facto abolished. With the progress 
of the reaction, however, the old conditions were to a certain extent 
re-established. In St Petersburg, for instance, the newspapers were 
in 1909 a^ain under the absolute jurisdiction of chief of police and 
were forbidden to publish any reference to members of the Imperial 
family or to the affairs of Poland (except official notices). In 19^8 
as many as 73 newspapers and periodicals were suppressed, of which 
28 were in St Petersburg alone.

Spain. — There was probably no country where restrictions on the 
liberty of the press were at one time more stringent than in Spain. 
From the first use of printing up to 1521 censorship was exercised 
by the Crown; after that date the Inquisition began to assume the 
right, and continued to do so up to its suppression in 1808. In 
1558 Philip II. denounced the penalty of death against even the 
possessor of a book upon the Index expurgatorius of the Inquisition. 
Some of the greatest names in Spanish literature were sufferers: 
Castillejo, Mendoza, Mariana and Quevedo incurred the displeasure 
of the Inquisition; Luis Ponce de Leon was imprisoned for his 
translation of the Song of Solomon. The last Index appeared in 
1790. 1 In 1812 the constitution promulgated by the regency in 
the name of Ferdinand VII. provided by art. 37* that all Spaniards 
should have liberty to write, print and publish their political ideas 
without any necessity for licence, examination or approbation pre- 
vious to publication, subject to the restrictions imposed by law. 
Art. 13 of the constitution of the 30th of June 1876, promul- 
gated on the accession of Alphonso XII., practically re-enacts this 
provision. 

Sweden.— The press law of the 16th of July 1812 is one of the 
fundamental laws of Sweden. It is an expansion of art. 86 of the 
constitution of the 6th of June 1809. Liberty of the press is declared 
to be the privilege of every Swede, subject to prosecution for libellous 
writing. Privileges of individuals as to publication are abolished. 
The title and place of publication of every newspaper or periodical 
must be registered, and every publication must bear the name of 
the printer and the place of printing. Press offences are tried by 
a jury of nine, chosen respectively by the prosecutor, the prisoner, 
and the court. The verdict of two-thirds of the jury is final. 

Switzerland. — Liberty of the press is secured by art. 45 of the 
constitution of 1848, re-enacted by art. 55 of the constitution of 
the 29th of May 1874. Each canton has its own laws for the repres- 
sion of abuse of the liberty, subject to the approbation of the federal 
council. The confederation can impose penalties on libels directed 
against itself or its officers. 

PRESTEIGN, a market town, urban district, and assize and 
county town of Radnorshire, Wales, situated on the Lug amidst 
beautiful scenery. Pop. (1901), 1245. Presteign is the terminus 
of a branch of the Great Western railway running north from 
Titley Junction in Herefordshire. The old-fashioned town 
contains the fine parish church of St Andrew, dating chiefly 
from the 15th century, and an interesting old inn, the " Radnor- 
shire Arms," once the residence of the Bradshaw family in the 
17th century. To the west rises the Wardon, a wooded hill laid 
out as a public park. Presteign is the most easterly spot on 
the Welsh border, a circumstance that is noted in the Cymric 
expression to mark the extreme breadth of the Principality — 
Tyddewi i Uanandras (" from St Davids to Presteign "). 

Although the Welsh name of Llanandras is said to denote a 
foundation by St Andras ap Rhun ap Brychan in the 5th 
century, the place seems to have been an obscure hamlet in the 
lordship of Moelynaidd until the 14th century, when Bishop 
David Martyn of St Davids (1290-1328) conferred valuable 
market privileges upon this his native place, which on doubtful 
authority is said to derive its English name from this priest. 
In 1542 Presteign was named as the meeting-place of the 
county sessions for Radnorshire in conjunction with New 
Radnor, and it has ever since ranked as the county town. 
Although an ancient borough by prescription, Presteign was 
not included in the Radnor parliamentary district until the 
19th century, and of this privilege it was deprived by the 
Redistribution Act of 1885. 

PRESTER JOHN, a fabulous medieval Christian monarch of 
Asia. The history of Prester John no doubt originally gathered 
round some nucleus of fact, though what that was is extremely 
difficult to determine. But the name and the figure which it 
suggested occupied so prominent a place in the mind of Europe 
for two or three centuries that a real history could hardly have a 
stronger claim to exposition. Before Prester John appears upon 
the scene we find the way prepared for his appearance by a 
kindred fable, which entwined itself with the legends about him. 
This is the story of the appearance at Rome (1122), in the 
pontificate of Calixtus II., of a certain Oriental ecclesiastic, 
whom one account styles " John, the patriarch of the Indians," 
and another " an archbishop of India." This ecclesiastic related 
wonderful stories of the shrine of St Thomas in India, and of 
the miracles wrought there by the body of the apostle, including 
1 See Ticknor, Hist, of Span. Lit. i. 422 seq., iii. 366 



PRESTEIGN— PRESTER JOHN 



the distribution of the sacramental wafer by his hand. We 
cannot regard the appearance at Rome of the personage who 
related these marvels in presence of the pope as a mere popular 
fiction: it rests on two authorities apparently independent (one 
of them a letter from Odo of Reims, abbot of St Remy from 
1 1 18 to 1 151), for their discrepancies show that one was not 
copied from the other, though in the principal facts they agree. 

Nearly a quarter of a century later Prester John appears 
upon the scene, in the character of a Christian conqueror and 
potentate who combined the characters of priest and king, and 
ruled over vast dominions in the Far East. This idea was uni- 
versal in Europe from about the middle of the 12th century 
to the end of the 13th or beginning of the 14th. The Asiatic 
story then died away, but the name remained, and the royal 
presbyter was now assigned a locus in Ethiopia. Indeed, it 
is not improbable that from a very early date the title was' 
assigned to the Abyssinian king, though for a time this identifi- 
cation was overshadowed by the prevalence of the Asiatic 
legend. At the bottom of the double allocation there was, no 
doubt, that confusion of Ethiopia with India which is as old as 
Virgil and perhaps older. 

The first mention of Prester John occurs in the chronicle of 
Otto, bishop of Freisingen. This writer states that when at ■ 
the papal court in 1145 he met with the bishop of Gabala (Jibal 
in Syria), who related how " not many years before one John, 
king and priest {rex el sacerdos), who dwelt in the extreme 
Orient beyond Persia and Armenia, and was, with his people, 
a Christian but a Nestorian, had made war against the brother 
kings of the Persians and Mcdes, who were called Samiards 
(or Sanjards), and captured Ecbatana their capital. After 
this victory Presbyter John — for so he was wont to be styled — 
advanced to fight for the Church at Jerusalem; but when he 
arrived at the Tigris and found no means of transport for his 
army, he turned northward, as he had heard that the river in 
that quarter was frozen over in winter-time. After halting on 
its banks for some years in expectation of a frost he was obliged 
to return home. This personage was said to be of the ancient 
race of the Magi mentioned in the Gospel, to rule the same 
nations that they ruled, and to have such wealth that he used 
a sceptre of solid emerald. Whatever impression was made by 
this report, or by other rumours of the event on which it was 
founded, was far exceeded, about 1165, by the circulation of a 
letter purporting to be addressed by Prester John to the 
emperor Manuel. This letter, professing to come from 
" Presbyter Joannes, by the power and virtue of God and of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, Lord of Lords," claimed that he was the 
greatest monarch under heaven, as well as a devout Christian. 
The letter dealt at length with the wonders of his empire. It 
was his desire to visit the Holy Sepulchre with a great host, 
and to subdue the enemies of the Cross. Seventy-two kings, 
reigning over as many kingdoms, w r ere his tributaries. His em- 
pire extended over the three Indies, including that Farther India, 
where lay the body of St Thomas, to the sun-rising, and back 
again down the slope to the ruins of Babylon and the tower of 
Babel. All the wild beasts arid monstrous creatures commemo- 
rated in current legend were to be found in his dominions, as 
well as all the wild and eccentric races of men of whom strange 
stories were told, including those unclean nations whom Alex- 
ander Magnus walled up among the mountains of the north, 
and who were to come forth at the latter day— and so were the 
Amazons and the Bragmans. His dominions contained the 
monstrous ants that dug gold and the fish that gave the purple; 
they produced all manner of precious stones and all the famous 
aromatics. Within them was found the Fountain of Youth; the 
pebbles which give light, restore sight, and render the possessor 
invisible; the Sea of Sand was there, stored with fish of wondrous 
savour; and the River of Stones was there also; besides a 
subterranean stream whose sands were of gems. His territory 
produced the worm called " salamander," which lived in fire, 
and which wrought itself an incombustible envelope from which 
were manufactured robes for the presbyter, which were washed 
in flaming fire. When the king went forth to war thirteen 



PRESTER JOHN 



great crosses made of gold and jewels were carried in wagons 
before him as his standards, and each was followed by 10,000 
knights and 100,000 footmen. There were no poor in his 
dominions, no thief or robber, no flatterer or miser, no "dissen- 
sions, no lies, and no vices. His palace was built after the plan 
of that which St Thomas erected for the Indian king Gondo- 
pharus. Of the splendour of this details are given. Before 
it was a marvellous mirror erected on a many-storeyed pedestal 
(described in detail); in this speculum he could discern every- 
thing that went on throughout his dominions, and detect 
conspiracies. He was waited on by 7 kings at a time, by 
60 dukes and 365 counts; 12 archbishops sat on his right 
hand, and 20 bishops on his left, besides the patriarch of 
St Thomas's, theprotopope of the Sarmagantians (Samarkand?), 
and the archprotopope of Susa, where the royal residence was. 
There was another palace of still more wonderful character, 
huilt by the presbyter's father in obedience to a heavenly 
command , in the city of Bribric. Should it be asked why, 
with all this power and splendour, he calls himself merely 
" presbyter," this is because of his humility, and because it 
was not fitting for one whose sewer was a primate and king, 
whose butler an archbishop and king, whose chamberlain a 
bishop and king, whose master of the horse an archimandrite 
and king, whose chief cook an abbot and king, to be called by 
such titles as these. 

How great was the popularity and diffusion of this letter 
may be judged in some degree from the fact that Zarncke in his 
treatise on Prester John gives a list of close on 100 MSS. 
of it. Of these there are 8 in the British Museum, 10 at 
Vienna, 13 in the great Paris library, 15 at Munich. There 
arc also several renderings in old German verse. Many 
circumstances of the time tended to render such a letter accept- 
able. Christendom would welcome gladly the intelligence 
of a counterpoise arising so unexpectedly to the Mahommedan 
power; while the statements of the letter itself combined a 
reference to and corroboration of all the romantic figments con- 
cerning Asia which already fed the curiosity of Europe, which 
figured in the world-maps, and filled that fabulous history of 
Alexander which for nearly a thousand years supplanted the real 
history of the Macedonian throughout Europe and western Asia. 

The only other surviving document of the 12th century bearing 
on this subject is a letter of which MS. copies are preserved in the 
Cambridge and Paris libraries, and which is also embedded in the 
chronicles of several English annalists, including Benedict of Peter- 
borough, Roger Hovedon and Matthew Paris. It purports to have 
been indited from the Rialto at Venice by Pope Alexander III. on 
the 5th day before the calends of October (Sept. 27), data which 
fix the year as 1177- The pope addresses it, carissimo in Christo 
filio Johanni, illustro et magmfico indorum regi [Hovedon 's copy here 
inserts sacerdoti Sanctis simo]. He recites how he had heard of^ the 
monarch's Christian profession, diligence in good works and piety, 
by manifold narrators and common report, but also more particularly 
from his (the pope's) physician and confidant (medicus et familiarts 
yioster), Master Philip, who had received information from honourable 
persons of the monarch's kingdom, with whom he had intercourse in 
those (Eastern) parts. Philip had also reported the king's anxiety for 
instruction in Catholic discipline and for reconciliation with the 
apostolic see in regard to all discrepancies, and his desire to have a 
church in Rome and an altar at Jerusalem. The pope goes on to say 
that he found it too difficul t, on account of the length and obstructions 
of the way, to send any one (of ecclesiastical position?) a latere, 
but he would despatch Philip to communicate instruction to him. 
And on accepting Philip's communications the king should send back 
honourable persons bearing letters sealed with his seal, in which 
his wishes should be fully set forth. " The more nobly and 
magnanimously thou conductest thyself, and the less thou vauntest 
of thy wealth and power, the more readily shall we regard thy wishes 
both as to the concession of a church in the city and of altars in the 
church of SS. Peter and Paul, and in the church of the Lord's 
Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and as to other reasonable requests." 

There is no express mention of the title " Prester John " in what 
seem the more genuine copies of this letter. But the address and 
the expression in the italicized passage just quoted (which evidently 
alludes to the vaunting epistle of 1165) hardly leave room for doubt 
that the pope supposed himself to be addressing the author of that 
letter. We do not know how far the imaginations about Prester 
John retained their vitality in 1221, forty-four years after the letter 
of Pope Alexander, for we know of no mention of Prester John in 
the interval. But in that year again a rumour came out of the East 
that a great Christian conqueror was taking the hated Moslems in 



305 

reverse and sweeping away their power. Prophecies current among 
the Christians in Syria of the destruction of Mahomet's sect after 
six centuries of duration added to the excitement attending these 
rumours. The name ascribed to the conqueror was David, and 
some called him the son or the grandson of Prester John of India. 
He whose conquests and slaughters now revived the legend was in 
fact no Christian or King David but the famous Tenghiz Khan. 
The delusion was dissipated slowly, and even after the great Tatar 
invasion and devastation of eastern Europe its effects stiff influenced 
the mind of Christendom and caused popes and kings to send 
missions to the Tatar hordes with a lingering feeling that their 
khans, if not already Christians, were at least always on the" verge 
of conversion. 

Before proceeding further we must go back to the bishop of 
Gabala's story. M. d'Avezac first showed to whom the story 
must apply. The only conqueror whose career suits in time and 
approximates in circumstances is the founder of Kara-Khitai, 
which existed as a great empire in Central Asia during the latter 
two-thirds of the 13th century. This oersonage was a prince of the 
Khitai or Khitaian dynasty of Liao, which had reigned over northern 
China and the regions beyond the Wall during a great part of the 
10th and nth centuries, and from which came the name Khitai 
(Cathay), by which China was once known in Europe and still is 
known in Russia. On the overthrow of the dynasty about 11 25 
this prince, who is called by the Chinese YeliuTashi, and had gone 
through a complete Chinese education, escaped westward with a 
body of followers. Being well received by the Uighurs and other 
tribes west of the desert, 'subjects of his family, he gathered an 
army and commenced a course of conquest which eventually 
extended over eastern and western Turkestan. He took the title 
of Gur Khan or Kor Khan, said to mean " universal " or " supreme " 
khan, and fixed at Balasaghun, north of the T'ian Shan range, the 
capital of his empire, which became known as that of Kara-Khitai 
(Black Cathay). In 1141 the assistance of this Khitaian prince 
was invoiced by the shah of Kharezm against Sanjar, the^ Seljuk 
sovereign of Persia, who had expelled the shah from his kingdom 
and killed his son. The Gur Khan came with a vast army of Turks, 
Khitaians, and others, and defeated Sanjar near Samarkand (Sept. 
iiai) in a battle which the historian Ibn al-Athir calls the greatest 
defeat that Islam had ever undergone in those regions. Though 
the Gur Khan himself is not described as having extended his con- 
quests into Persia, the shah of Kharezm followed up the victory by 
invading Khorasan and plundering the cities and treasuries of 
Sanjar. In this event — the defeat of Sanjar, whose brother's son, 
Mas'ud, reigned over western Persia — occurring four years before 
the story of the Eastern conqueror was told at Rome to Bishop Otto, 
we seem to have the destruction of the Samiardi fratres or Sanjar 
brothers, which was the germ of the story of Prester John. 

There is no evidence of any profession of Christianity on the part 
of the Gur Khan, though the daughter of the last 01 his race is 
recorded to have been a Christian. The hosts of the Gur Khan are 
called by Moslem historians Al~Turk-al~Kuffar, the kafir or infidel 
Turks; and in later days the use of this term " kafir " led to mis- 
apprehensions, as when Vasco da Gama's people were led to take 
for Christians the Banyan traders on the African coast, and to 
describe as Christian sovereigns so many princes of the Farther East 
of whom they heard at Calicut. How the name John arose is one 
of the obscure points. Oprjert supposes the titfe " Gur Khan " 
to have been confounded with Yukhanan or Johannes; and it is 
probable that even in the Levant the stories of ' John the patriarch 
of the Indies," repeated in the early part of this article, may have 
already mingled with the rumours from the East. 

The failure in the history of the Gur Khan to meet all points in 
the story of the bishop of Gabala led Professor Bruun of Odessa 
to bring forward another candidate for identity with the original 
Prester John, in the person of the Georgian prince John Orbelian, 
the " sbasalar," or generalissimo under several kings of Georgia in 
that age. He shows instances, in documents of the 15th century, 
of the association of Prester John with the Caucasus. In one at 
least of these the title is applied to the king of Abassia, i.e. of the 
Abhasians of Caucasus. Some confusion between Abash (Abyssinia) 
and Abhas seems to be possibly at the bottom of the imbroglio. 
An abstract of Professor Bruun's argument will be found in the 
2nd edition of Sir H. Yule's Marco Polo, ii. 539-542. As regards any 
real foundation for the title of " Presbyter we may observe 
that nothing worth mentioning has been alleged on behalf of any 
candidate. 

When the Mongol conquests threw Asia open to Frank travellers 
in the middle of the 13th century their minds were full of Prester 
John ; they sought in vain for an adequate representative, nor was 
it in the nature of things that they should not find some repre- 
sentative. In fact they found severaf. Apparently no real tradition 
existed among the Eastern Christians of such a personage; the 
myth had taken shape from the clouds of rumour as they rolled 
westward from Asia. But the persistent demand produced a supply; 
and the honour of identification with Prester John, after hovering 
over one head and another, settled for a long time upon that of 
the king of the Nestorian tribe of Kcrait, famous in the histories 
of Jenghiz under the name of Ung or Awang Khan.

PRESTER JOHN 



of the Christians of India the Greater, who defeats the Tatars by 
an elaborate stratagem, Oppert recognizes Jalaluddin of Kharezm 
and his brief success over the Mongols in Afghanistan. In the 
Armenian prince Sempad's account (1248), on the other hand, this 
Christian king of India is aided by the Tatars to defeat and harass 
the Saracens, and becomes the vassal of the Mongols. In the nar- 
rative of William Rubruquis (1253), though distinct reference is 
made to the conquering Gur Khan under the name of Coir Cham of 
Caracatay, the title of " King John " is assigned to Kushluk, king 
of the Naimans, who had married the daughter of the last lineal 
representative of the gur khans. 1 And from the remarks which 
Rubruquis makes in connexion with this King John, on the habit 
of the Nestorians to spin wonderful stories out of nothing, and of 
the great tales that went forth about King John, it is evident that 
the intelligent traveller supposed this king of the Naimans to be 
the original of the widely spread legend. He mentions, however, 
a brother of this John called Unc who ruled over the Crit and 
Merkit (or Kerait and Mekrit, two of the great tribes of Mongolia), 
whose history he associates with that of Jenghiz Khan. Unc Khan 
reappears in Marco Polo, who tells much about him as " a great 
prince, the same that we call Prester John, him in fact about whose 
great dominion all the world talks. This Unc was in fact the 
prince of the Kerait, called by the Chinese Tuli, and by the Persian 
historians of the Mongols Toghral, on whom the Kin emperor of 
north China had conferred the title of " wang " or king, whence 
his coming to be known as A wang or Ung Khan. He was long 
the ally of Jenghiz, but a breach occurred between them, and they 
were mortal enemies till the death of Ung Khan in 1203. In the 
narrative of Marco Polo " Unc Can," alias Prester John, is the liege 
lord of the Tatars, to whom they paid tribute until Jenghiz arose. 
And this is substantially the story repeated by otner European 
writers of the end of the 13th century, such as Ricold of Monte- 
croce and the sieur de Joinville, as well as by one Asiatic, the 
famous Christian writer, Gregory Abulfaraj. We can find no 
Oriental corroboration of the claims of Ung Khan to supremacy 
over the Mongols. But that his power and dignity were consider- 
able appears from the term " Padshah," which is applied to him 
by the historian Rashiduddin. 

We find Prester John in one more phase before he vanishes from 
Asiatic history, real or mythical. Marco Polo in the latter part' 
of the 13th century, and Friar John of Montecorvino, afterwards 
archbishop of Cambaluc, in the beginning of the 14th, speak of the 
descendants of Prester John as holding territory under the great 
khan in a locality which can be identified with the plain of Kuku- 
Khotan, north of the great bend of the Yellow riyer and about 
280 m. north-west of Peking. The prince reigning in the time of 
these two writers was named King George, and was the " 6th in 
descent from Prester John," i.e. no doubt from Awang Khan. 
Friar Odoric, about 1326, visited the country still ruled by the 
prince whom he calls Prester John; " but," he says, " as regards 
him, not one-hundredth part is true that is told of him." With 
this mention Prester John ceases to have any pretension to histori- 
cal existence in Asia (for we need not turn aside to Mandeville[s 
fabulous revival of old stories or to the barefaced fictions of his 
contemporary, John of Hese, which bring in the old tales of the 
miraculous body of St Thomas), and his connexion with that quarter 
of the world gradually died out of the memory of Europe. 2 

When next we begin to hear his name it is as an African, not 
as an Asiatic prince; and the personage so styled is in fact the 
Christian king of Abyssinia. Ludolf has asserted that this applica- 
tion was an invention of the Portuguese and arose only in the 15th 
century. But this is a mistake; for in fact the application had 
begun much earlier, and probably long before the name had ceased 
to be attached by writers on Asia to the descendants of the king 
of the Kerait. It is true that the Florentine Simone Sigoli, who 
visited Cairo in 1384, in his Viaggio al Monte Sinai still speaks of 
4i Presto Giovanni " as a monarch dwelling in India; but it is the 
India which is conterminous with the dominions of the soldan of 
Egypt, and whose lord is master of the Nile, to close or open its 
discharge upon Egypt. Thirty years earlier (c. 1352) the Franciscan 
Giovanni de* Marignolli, apostolic legate in Asia, speaks in his 
Chronica of Ethiopia where the Negroes are, and which is called the 
land of Prester John. 8 Going back still further, Friar Jordanus 

1 It has been pointed out by Alexander Wylie that Kushluk was 
son of a powerful king of the Naimans, whose name Ta- Yang-Khan 
is precisely " Great King John " as nearly as that could be expressed 
in Chinese. 

2 The stories of Khitai as a Christian empire, which led the Jesuits 
at the court of Akbar to despatch Benedict Goes in search of it 
(1601), did, however, suggest to Jerome Xavier, their chief, that the 
country in question "was the Cathay of Marco Polo, and its Christian 
king the representative of the famous Prester John " — a jumble of 
inaccuracy. 

a In a Spanish work of about the same date, by an anonymous 
Franciscan, we are told that the emperor called " Abdeselib, which 
means ' servant of the^ Cross,* is a protector of Preste Juan, who is 
the patriarch of Nubia and Ethiopia, and is lord of many great 
lands, and many cities of Christians, though they be black as 



" Catalani," who returned from the East before 1328, speaks of 
the emperor of the Ethiopians " quern vos vocatis Prestre Johan" 

But, indeed, we shall have strong probability on our side ii we 
go back much further still, and say that, however vague may have 
been the ideas of Pope Alexander III. respecting the geographical 
position of the potentate whom he addressed from Venice in 1177, 
the only real person to whom the letter can have been sent was the 
king of Abyssinia. Let it be observed that the " honourable per- 
sons of the monarch's kingdom " whom the leech Philip had met 
with in the East must have been the representatives of some real 
power, and not of a phantom. It must have been a real king who 
professed to desire reconciliation with the Catholic Church and the 
assignation of a church at Rome and of an altar at Jerusalem. 
Moreover, we know that the Ethiopic Church did long possess a 
chapel and altar in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and, though 
we have been unable to find travellers* testimony to this older than 
about 1497, it is quite possible that the appropriation may have 
originated much earlier.* We know from Marco Polo that about a 
century after the date of Pope Alexander's epistle a mission was 
sent by the king of Abyssinia to Jerusalem to make offerings on 
his part at the Church of the Sepulchre. It must be remembered 
that at the time of the pope's letter Jerusalem, which had been taken 
from the Moslem in 1099, was still in Christian possession. Abys- 
sinia had been going through a long period of vicissitude and dis- 
traction. In the 10th century the royal line had been superseded 
by a dynasty of Falasha Jews, followed by other Christian families; 
but weakness and disorder continued till the restoration of the 
" House of Solomon " (c. 1268). Nothing is more likely than that 
the princes of the " Christian families " who had got possession of 
the throne of northern Abyssinia should have wished to strengthen 
themselves by a connexion with European Christendom, and to 
establish relations with Jerusalem, then in Christian hands. We 
do not know whether the leech Philip ever reached his destination, 
or whether a reply ever came back to the Lateran. 6 

Baronius, who takes the view for which we have been arguing, sup- 
poses it possible that the church in Rome possessed in his own 
time by the Abyssinians (St Stephen's in the Vatican) might have 
been granted on this occasion. But we may be sure that this was 
a modern concession during the attempts to master the Ethiopian 
Church early in the 16th century. Ludolf intimates that its occu- 
pancy had been taken from them in his own time after it had been 
held " for more than a century." 

In the legendary history of the Translation of the three Blessed 
Kings by John of Hildesheim (c. 1370), of which an account and 
extracts are given by Zarncke (Abnandl. li. 154 seq.) : we have an 
evident iumble in the writer's mind between the Asiatic and the 
African location of Prester John; among other matters it is stated 
that Prester John and the Nubians dug a chapel out of the rock 
under Calvary in honour of the three kings: " et vocatur ilia 
capella in partibus illis capella Nubiyanorum ad reges in praesentem 
diem, sed Sarracini . . . ob invidiam obstruxerunt " (p. 158). 

From the 14th century onwards Prester John had found his 
seat in Abyssinia. It is there that Fra Mauro's great map (1459) 
presents a fine city with the"rubric, " Qui il Preste Janni fa residentia 
principal." When, nearer the end of the century (1481-1495), King 

pitch, and brand themselves with the sign of the cross in token of 
their baptism " (Libro del conocitniento de todos reynos, &c, printed 
at Madrid, 1877). 

* Indeed, we can carry the date back half a century further by the 
evidence of a letter translated in Ludolf (Comment, p. 303). This 
is addressed from Shoa by the king Zara Jacob in the eighth year of 
his reign (1442) to the Abyssinian monks, dwellers at Jerusalem. 
The king desires them to light certain lamps in the Church of the 
Sepulchre, including " three in our chapel. In the Pilgerfahrt des 
Rttters Arnold von Harff (1496-1499: Cologne, i860, p. 175), we 
find it stated that the Abyssinians had their chapel, &c, to the 
left of the Holy Sepulchre, between two pillars of the Temple, whilst 
the Armenian chapel was over theirs, reached by a stone staircase 
alongside of the Indians (or Abyssinians). This exactly corresponds 
with the plan and reference given in Sandys 's Travels (161 5), p. 162, 
which show the different chapels. The first on the south, t.e. the . 
•left looking from the body of the church, is " No. 35. — The chappell 
of the Abisines, over which the chappell of the Armenians. A 
reference to Jerusalem, which we procured through the kindness 
of Mr Walter Besant, shows that the Abyssinians no longer have 
a chapel or privileges in the Church of the Sepulchre. Between the 
Armenians and the Copts they have been deprived of these, and 
even of the keys of their convent. The resentment of King Theodore 
at the loss of these privileges was one of the indirect causes which 
led to the war between him and England in 1867-68. 

6 Matthew Paris gives a letter from Philip, prior of the Dominicans 
in Palestine, which reached the pope in 1237, and which speaks of 
a prelate from whom he had received several letters, "qui praeest 
omnibus quos Nestoriana haeresis ab ecclesia separavit (cujus 
praelatio per Indiam Majorem, et per regnum sacerdotis Johannis, 
et per regna magis proxima Orienti dilatatur)." We have little 
doubt that Abyssinia was the " regnum " here indicated, though it 
was a mistake to identify the Abyssinian Church with the Nestorians. 



PRESTIDIGITATION— PRESTON

John II. of Portugal was prosecuting inquiries regarding access to 
India his first object was to open communication with " Prester 
John of the Indies," who was understood to be a Christian potentate 
in Africa. And when Vasco da Gama went on his voyage from 
Mozambique northwards he began to hear of " Preste Joham " as 
reigning in the interior — or rather, probably, by the light of his 
preconceptions of the existence of that personage in East Africa he 
thus interpreted what was told him. More than twenty years 
later, when the first book on Abyssinia was composed — that of 
Alvarez — the title designating the king of Abyssinia is " Prester 
John," or simply " the Preste/' 

On the whole subject in its older aspects, sec Ludolf's Historia 
Aeihiobica and its Commentary , passim. The excellent remarks of 
M. d'Avezac, comprising a conspectus of almost the whole essence 
of the subject, are in the Recueil de voyages et de memoirs pub- 
lished by the Societe de G6ographie, iv. 547-564 (Paris, 1839). 
Two German works of importance which have been used in this 
article are the interesting and suggestive Der Presbyter Johannes in 
Sage und Gcschichte, by Dr Gustav Oppert (2nd ed., Berlin, 1870), 
and, most important of all in its learned, careful and critical collec- 
tion and discussion of all the passages bearing on the subject, Der 
Priester Johannes, by Fricdrich Zarncke of Leipzig (1876-1879). 
See also Sir H. Yule's Cathay and the Way Thither, p. 173 seq., and 
in Marco Polo (2nd.ed.), i. 229-233, ii. 539-543. (H. Y.) 

PRESTIDIGITATION (from Lat. praesto, ready, and digitus, 
finger), the art of conjuring by nimble-fingered dexterity, 
particularly as opposed to the use of mechanical devices (see 
Conjuring). The Latin praestigitim, illusion, praestigiae 
tricks, and praestigiator , juggler (from prae, before, and stinger e } 
to prick), cover the same meaning though differently derived. 

PRESTIGE, influence and authority exercised by reason of 
high reputation. It is one of the few words which have gained 
a meaning superior to that of original usage. The word in 
French, from which it has been borrowed by English, as in 
Latin praestigium or praestigiae, meant jugglers' tricks, deceit, 
imposture, and so is found in the 16th century. The Latin 
stands for praestrigium, from praestringere, to bind or fasten 
tight, hence to blindfold; others derive from praestinguere, to 
darken, obscure, deceive. The word was at first generally used 
as foreign and italicized; thus the New English Dictionary 
quotes Sir Walter Scott (Paul's Letters lo his Kinsfolk, 181 5) 
for the earliest example in English of the modern usage, 
" Napoleon needed the dazzling blaze of decisive victory to 
renew the charm or prestige . . . once attached to his name 
and fortunes." Other words derived from praestigium through 
the French retain the original meaning of juggling or conjuring 
(see Prestidigitation). 

PRESTON, JOHN (1587-1628), English Puritan divine, was 
born at Heyford in Northamptonshire and was educated at 
Queens' College, Cambridge (fellow 1609). He took orders, 
and on becoming dean of his college drew large crowds to hear 
his preaching. On the duke of Buckingham's advice he was 
appointed chaplain to Prince Charles in 1620; in 1622 he became 
preacher at Lincoln's Inn and master of Emmanuel College, 
Cambridge. After the accession of Charles I. he worked hard 
on behalf of the Puritan cause, but could accomplish little or 
nothing against Archbishop Laud. In theology he was a stanch 
Calvinist and his writings had considerable popularity. 

PRESTON, a municipal, county, and parliamentary borough 
and port, of Lancashire, England, on the river Ribble, 209 m. 
N.W. by N. from London by the London & North-Western 
railway, served also by the Lancashire & Yorkshire railway. 
Pop. (1891), 107,573; (1901), 112,989; at the beginning of the 
19th century it was about 17,000. The nucleus of its site consists 
of a ridge rising sharply from the north bank of the river, while 
the surrounding country, especially to the west about the estuary, 
is flat. Among the numerous parish churches that of St John, 
built in Decorated style in 1855, occupies a site which has 
carried a church from early times. Among several Roman 
Catholic churches, that of St Walpurgis (1854) is a handsome 
building of Early Decorated character. Of public buildings 
the most noteworthy is the large town hall, with lofty tower 
and spire, in Early English style, built in 1867 from designs by 
Sir Gilbert Scott. 

The free public library and museum were established in 1879 
by the trustees of 'E. K. Harris, a prominent citizen. A new 



building was opened in 1893. Here is placed Dr Shepherd's library 
founded in 1761, of nearly 9000 volumes, as well as a collection of 
pictures, &c, valued at £4°.°oo. bequeathed by the late R. Newsham. 
The Harris Institute, endowed by the above-named trustees with 
£40,000, is established in a building of classical style erected in 1849, 
wherein are held science and art classes, and a chemical laboratory 
is maintained. For the grammar school, founded in 1550, a building 
in the Tudor style was erected in 1841 by private shareholders, 
but in i860 they sold it to the corporation, who now have the 
management of the school. The blue-coat school, founded in 1701, 
was in 18 17 amalgamated with the national schools. A Victoria 
Jubilee technical school was established under a grant from the 
Harris trustees in 1897. There is also a deaf and dumb school. 
Preston is well supplied with public recreation grounds, including 
Avenham Park, the Miller Park, with a statue of the 14th earl 
of Derby (d. 1869), the Moor Park, the Marsh, and the Deepdalc 
grounds, with an observatory. Preston is one of the principal seats 
of the cotton manufacture in Lancashire. There are also iron and 
brass foundries, engineering works, cotton machinery works, and 
boiler works, and some shipbuilding is carried on. In 1826 Preston 
became a creek of Lancaster, in 1839 it was included in the new 
port of Fleetwood, and in 1843 it was created an independent port. 
The trade of the port was insignificant until the construction of 
spacious docks, in conjunction with the deepening of the river 
from the quays of Preston to its outfall in the Irish Sea, a distance 
of 16 m., was begun in 1884, and was carried out at a cost of over 
one million sterling. The main wet dock, opened in 1892, is 3240 ft. 
long and 600 ft. wide. The total quayage is over 8500 lineal feet. 
The channel of the river has been made straighter, and from docks 
to sea deepened, so that the dock is accessible for vessels of 17 ft. 
draught on ordinary spring tides. A canal connects Preston with 
Lancaster. 

The parliamentary borough, which returns two members, falls 
between the Blackpool and Darwen divisions of the county. The 
corporation consists of a mayor, 12 aldermen and 36 councillors. 
Area of municipal borough, 3971 acres. 

Preston, otherwise Prestune, was near the minor Roman 
station at Walton-le-Dale and the great Roman road running 
from Warrington passed through it. It is mentioned in Domes- 
day Book as one of Earl Tostig's possessions which had fallen 
to Roger of Poictou, and on his defection it was forfeited to the 
Crown. 1 Henry II. about the year 11 79 granted the burgesses 
a charter by which he confirmed to them the privileges he had 
granted to Newcastle-under-Lyme, the chief of which were a 
free borough and a gild merchant. This is the first of fourteen 
royal charters which have been granted to Preston, the chief of 
which are as follows: John in 1199 confirmed to Preston .all 
the rights granted by Henry II.'s charter and also " their fair 
of eight days" from the Assumption (Aug. 15) and a three 
days' fair from the eve of Saints Simon and Jude (Oct. 28). 
Henry III. in 121 7 confirmed the summer fair, but for five days 
only, and granted a weekly market on Wednesday. Edward III. 
(1328), Richard II. (1379), Henry IV. (1401), Henry V. (1414), 
Henry VI. (1425) and Philip and Mary (1557) confirmed the 
previous charters. The weekly market, though granted for 
Wednesday, was held as early as 1292 on Saturday. Elizabeth 
in 1566 granted the town its great charter which ratified and 
extended all previous grants, including the gild merchant,, the 
weekly market on Saturday and the two annual fairs, in August- 
for eight days and in October for seven days. Charles II. in 
1662 and 1685 granted charters, by the latter of which an 
additional weekly market on Wednesday was conceded and a 
three days' fair beginning on the 16th of March. The most 
important industry used to be woollen weaving. Elizabeth's 
charter granted to the corporation all fees received from the 
sealing of cloth within the borough, and in 1571 the mayor 
reported that the cloths usually made near Preston were " narrow 
white kearses." Other early industries were glove-making 
and linen cloth. The first cotton-spinning mill was built in 1777 
in Moor Lane, and in 1791 John Horrocks built the Yellow 
Factory. In 1835 there were forty factories, chiefly spinning, 
yielding 70,000 lb of cotton yarn weekly. A gild existed 
perhaps in Saxon times, but the grant of a gild merchant dates 
from Henry II.'s charter, about 11 79. The first gild of which 
there was any record was celebrated in 1328, at which it was 
decided to hold a gild every twenty years. Up to 1542, however, 
they do not appear to have been very regularly celebrated, but 

1 The Court lect was held twice a year up to 1835.

since that year they have been and still are held at intervals of 
twenty years. A special gild mayor is appointed on each occa- 
sion. The first mention of a procession at the gild is in 1500. 
One of the most important items of business was the enrolling 
of freemen, and the gild rolls are records of the population. In 
1397 the gild roll contained the names of over 200 in-burgesses 
and 100 foreign burgesses; in 1415 the number of in-burgesses 
was 188, which in 1459 had declined to 72. In 1582 there were 
over 500 in-burgesses and 340 out-burgesses. There is no 
evidence for, but rather against, the common statement that 
Preston was burnt or razed to the ground during the Scottish 
invasion of 1322. The town suffered severely from the Black 
Death In^ 1340-1350, when as many as 3000 persons are said 
to have died, and again in the year November 1630 to November 
1 63 1, 1100 died of pestilence. During the Civil War Preston 
sided with the king and became the headquarters of the Royalists 
in Lancashire. In February 1643 Sir John Seaton with a 
Parliamentary .force marched from Manchester and successfully 
assaulted it. A strong Parliamentary garrison was established 
here and its fortifications repaired, but in March the earl of 
Derby recaptured the tojma. The Royalists did not garrison it, 
but after demolishing the greater part of the works left it un- 
fortified. After the battle of Marston Moor Prince Rupert 
marched through Preston in September 1644 and carried the 
mayor and bailiffs prisoners to Skipton Castle, where they were 
confined for twelve months. On the 17th of August 1648 the 
Royalist forces under the duke of Hamilton and General Langdale 
were defeated at Preston by Cromwell with a loss of 1000 killed 
and 4000 taken prisoners. During the Rebellion of 1715 the 
rebel forces entered Preston on the 9th of November, and after 
proclaiming the Chevalier de St George king at the cross in the 
market-place, remained here for some days, during which the 
government forces advanced. The town was assaulted, and on 
the 14th of November General Forster surrendered his army of 
about 1400 men to the king's forces. In 1745 Prince Charles 
Edward marched through on the way south and north, but the 
town took no part in the rebellion. The borough returned two 
members from 1295 to 133 1, then ceased to exercise the privilege 
on account of poverty till 1529, but since that date (except in 
1653) it has always sent two representatives to parliament. 
The curious institution of the mock mayor and corporation 
of Walton, which was at its foundation in 1701 a Jacobite 
association, ceased after 1766 to be of any political significance 
and lapsed in 1800. There was probably a church here in 
Saxon times and it is believed to be one of the three churches in 
Amounderness mentioned in Domesday Book. In 1094 it is 
named in a charter of Roger de Poictou. The early dedication 
was to St Wilfrid, but probably about 1531, when it was rebuilt, 
it was re-dedicated to St John. At the time of the Reformation, 
many, especially among the neighbouring gentry, clung to the 
old faith, and there is still a large Roman Catholic population. 
There were two monastic foundations here: a hospital dedicated 
to St Mary Magdalene, which stood on the Maudlands, and a 
Franciscan convent of Grey Friars situated to the west of 
Friargate. In the 18th century Preston had a high reputation 
as a centre of fashionable society, and earned the epithet still 
familiarly associated with it, " proud."

A mile to the east of the village is the site of the battle of the 
21st of September 1745, in which Prince Charles Edward and 
his highlanders gained a complete victory over the royal forces 
under Sir John Cope. Colonel James Gardiner was mortally 
wounded after an heroic stand, and an obelisk in the grounds 
of his house at Bankton, close to the battlefield, commemorates 
his valour, while the ballad of Adam Skirving (1710-1803), 
" Hey, Johnnie Cope!" has immortalized the rout of Cope. 

Until the beginning of the 19th century, the salt trade was 
prosecuted with great success, the pans having been laid down as 
long ago as 1185, but the industry has declined. There are manu- 



factures of fire-bricks, tiles and pottery, besides brewing and soap- 
making. In the vicinity there is an extensive coal-field. Fisheries 
are still of importance, although the bed of Pandore oysters (an 
esteemed variety) has lost something of its former fertility. There 
are harbours at Morrison's Haven to the west and at Cockenzie 
and Port Seton to the north-east, which practically form one 
village, with a population of 1687. The cross of the barony of 
Preston dates from 1617. Schaw's Hospital Trust, at one time 
intended for the education and maintenance of the children of 
poor parents, has been modified, and the bequest is used to provide 
free education and bursaries, while the building has been leased 
by the trustees of Miss Mary Murray, who bequeathed £20,000 
(afterwards increased to £30,000) for the training of poor children 
as domestic servants. 

PRESTWICH, SIR JOSEPH (1812-1896), English geologist, 
was born at Clapham, Surrey, on the 12th of March, 181 2. He 
was educated in Paris, Reading and at University College, 
London, where under Dr D. Lardner and Edward Turner, he 
paid special attention to natural philosophy and chemistry, 
and gained some knowledge of mineralogy and geology. Circum- 
stances compelled him to enter into commercial life, and until 
he was sixty years of age he was busily engaged in the City as 
a wine merchant. He devoted all his leisure to geology. His 
business journeys enabled him to see and learn much of the 
general geology of England, Scotland and France, and this so 
effectively that at the time of his death he ranked as the most 
eminent of British geologists. As early as 1831 he commenced, 
during holiday visits, to make a study of the coal-field of Coal- 
brookdale in Shropshire, and the results of his observations 
were communicated to the Geological Society of London in 
1834 and 1836, and embodied in a memoir published in 1838. 
His name is, however, especially known in connexion with his 
researches on the Eocene strata of the London and Hampshire 
Basins (1846-1857): he defined the Thanet Sands and the 
Woolwich and Reading Beds, and studied the sequence of 
deposits and of organic remains and the method of formation 
of these and the succeeding strata of London clay and Bagshot 
Beds.^ So highly appreciated were his essays on the subject 
that in 1849 he was awarded the Woilaston Medal by the 
Geological Society of London; and in 1853 he was elected F.R.S. 
In the course of his observations he was led to study questions 
of water supply and published in 1851 A Geological Inquiry 
respecting the Water-bearing Strata of the Country around London, 
a work that at once became a standard authority; and his 
extensive knowledge in that respect procured him a seat on the 
Royal Commission on Water Supply, appointed in 1866. From 
1858 the question of the antiquity of man engaged his attention. 
On various occasions statements had been made as to the 
association of flint implements formed by man with the bones 
of extinct mammals which belonged to more remote periods 
than those generally assigned for the appearance of the human 
race on this earth, but the evidence adduced had usually been 
disregarded by geologists as not affording sufficient proof of 
the point. Prestwich, together with Dr Hugh Falconer and 
Sir John Evans, saw the desirability of a closer examination 
of the facts, particularly in regard to the implements discovered 
by Boucher de Perthes in the gravels of the Somme valley; 
and their investigations in France and England yielded evidence 
which proved that man existed contemporaneously, with the 
Pleistocene mammalia (Phil.' Trans.. 1861 and 1864). In 1865 
a Royal Medal was awarded to' Prestwich by the Royal Society. 
In 1866 he was chosen one of the commissioners appointed to 
inquire into the several matters relating to coal in the United 
Kingdom; and he subsequently contributed an important 
Report on the Quantities of Coal, wrought and unwrought, in the 
Coalfields of Somersetshire and part of Gloucestershire, and another 
Report on the Probabilities of finding Coal in the South of England 
(1871). His researches on the Crag Beds of Suffolk and Norfolk, 
his report on Brixham Cave, his papers on the Channel Tunnel 
and the Chesil Bank, among others published during the years 
1868-1875, may be mentioned. 

In 1870 he married Grace Anne McCall (nee Milne), niece of 
Dr H. Falconer, and author of the Harbour Bar and other 
works (see Essays Descriptive and Biographical, by Grace, Lady

Prestwich; edited by L. E. Milne, 1901). Prestwich retired 
from business in 1872, and two years later he was invited to 
take the chair of geology at Oxford, vacant through the death 
of John Phillips. This post he occupied until 1887. During 
his professorship he wrote his great work entitled Geology: 
Chemical, Physical and Stratigraphical (vol. i., 1886; vol. ii., 
1888). 

On leaving Oxford Prestwich spent his remaining years in 
his country house, Darent-Hulme, Shoreham, Kent, erected by 
him in 1869. There, although seventy-six years of age, he 
maintained marvellous activity in geological research, devoting 
his attention to the superficial deposits of the Darent valley, to 
the occurrence of palaeolithic flint implements in the valleys 
and of an earlier type since called eolithic, on the chalk 
plateau of Kent; he likewise dealt generally with the raised 
beaches and rubble-drift of the south of England and their 
relation to recent changes of level. His latest publications were 
Collected Papers on some Controverted Questions of Geology, and 
On Certain Phenomena belonging to the Close of the Last Geological 
Period and on their Bearing upon the Tradition of the Flood (1895). 
He was knighted in 1896, and died on the 23rd of June in the 
same year, at Shoreham in Kent.

PRESTWICH, an urban district in the Prestwich parlia- 
mentary division of Lancashire, England, 5 m. N.N.W. of Man- 
chester on the Lancashire & Yorkshire railway. Pop. (1901), 
12,839. It possesses cotton manufactures, but consists chiefly 
of handsome mansions and villas inhabited by Manchester 
merchants. 

PRETORIA, the administrative capital of the Union of South 
Africa and of the province of the Transvaal, 46 m. by rail N. by 
E. of Johannesburg. Pop. (1904) 36,839, of whom 21,114 were 
whites. Pretoria is situated on the banken veld or northern 
slopes of the high veld, on both banks of the Aapies tributary 
of the Limpopo, and is 4470 ft. above the sea, being 1300 ft. 
lower than Johannesburg. Built in a hollow surrounded by 
hills, the aspect of the town with the river flowing through it and 
its broad streets lined with willows is picturesque. In summer 
the heat and moisture are excessive, and the Aapies (which is 
spanned by four bridges) is liable to floods. 

The town is regularly laid out in rectangular blocks of uniform 
width. The older part lies on the west side of the Aapies River 
and between it and a smaller stream known as the Spruit. In 
the centre of this part of Pretoria is Church Square, so named 
from the Dutch Reformed Church which stood in it, but was 
demolished in 1905. Government buildings on the south side 
of the square contain the chambers of the Provincial Council 
and other public offices. They were erected in 1892 and are a 
handsome block in Renaissance style, three-storied, with a cen- 
tral tower surmounted by a statue of Liberty. On the north 
side of the square are the law courts, on the west side the Post 
Office. The chief banking offices are also in the square. 

Running east and west from Church Square is Church Street, 
the chief business thoroughfare. A little east of Church Square 
this street opens on to Market Square, with commodious market 
buildings. The former Presidency, the residence of Paul Kruger, 
is at the western end of the street near the Spruit. Opposite it 
is the Dopper Church, in which Kruger used occasionally to preach. 
Other churches in the heart of the town include the Anglican cathe- 
dral, dedicated to St Alban, and the Presbyterian Church, both 
in Schoemans Street, the Roman Catholic Church in Koch Street 
with schools, convent buildings and extensive grounds, and the 
new Dutch Reformed Church in Vermeulen Street. In the north 
of the town is the National Museum and adjacent are the Zoological 
Gardens. Other public buildings are the government library, the 
University College and the opera house. East of the Aapies and 
on the slopes of the hills are the residential districts of Arcadia, 
Sunnyside and Muckleneuk. Bryntirion, a suburb on the northern 
slopes of the hills, contains the residences of the chief officials, 
including Government House. Here is Meintjes Kop, with a broad 
natural shelf midway below the summit. This shelf was chosen 
in 1909 as the site of the public offices of the Union. The designs 
of Mr Herbert Baker were accepted for two large blocks of identical 
design connected by a semicircular colonnade (passing behind the 
narrow kloof which bisects the shelf). Besides other open spaces 



there is Burger's park, originally planned, during the first British 
occupation, as a botanical garden. It is beautifully wooded and 
through it runs the Spruit. A park and sports ground at the western 
end of the town contains the pedestal for a statue of President 
Kruger. The statue itself remained for years at Lourenco Marques 
and appears to have been lost. Adjoining this park on the north 
is the cemetery. Among those buried there are Kruger and many 
of the British who fell during the war of 1890- 1902. Signal Hill, 
which rises 400 ft. above the plain, is west of the park. The plateau 
at its foot was the site of the English laager during the war of 
1880-81, and is now occupied by the central railway station and 
workshops. North of the cemetery is the prison, a building 
which replaces a notoriously insanitary gaol used during the 
republican regime. 

The water supply of Pretoria is drawn from the source of the 
Aapies River, where rise magnificent springs. The Fountains, as 
they are called, are 3 m. west of Pretoria. Some 3 m. north of 
the town is the Wonderboom, an enormous wild fig-tree, the only 
one of its kind in the district. At West Fort, 7 m. from the town, 
is a leper asylum; at Waterval, 15 m. north, the British prisoners 
captured by the Boers up to the fall of Pretoria were confined. 
Thirty miles east by north of Pretoria is the Premier Diamond mine. 
Bronkhorst Spruit, where in December 1880 a detachment of 
British soldiers was ambushed by the Boers, lies about 30 m. east by 
south of the town. 

History. — Pretoria was founded in 1855, the ground on which 
it stands being purchased by the Boer government from Mar- 
thinus Pretorius. It was made the centre of a new district 
created at the same time, both town and district being named in 
honour of Andries Pretorius. By treaty between the South 
African Republic (then comprising the districts of Potchef- 
stroom, Rustenburg, Pretoria and Zoutpansberg) and the re- 
public of Lydenburg, concluded at Pretoria in i860, the two 
republics were united and Pretoria chosen as the capital of the 
whole state, and in September of that year the Volksraad held 
its first meeting in the new capital. Until 1864, however, when 
the civil war in the Transvaal ended, Potchefstroom remained 
the virtual capital of the country. From that year the seat 
of government has always been at Pretoria. There in 1877 Sir 
Theophilus Shepstone proclaimed the annexation of the Trans- 
vaal to Great Britain. In December 1880 it was invested by 
the Boers, but held out until the conclusion of peace. In 1881 
the convention restoring self-government to the Transvaal was 
signed at Pretoria. From that time until 1900 the dominating 
figure in the town was that of the president — Paul Kruger. As 
revenue flowed in from the gold-mines on the Rand many fine 
buildings were erected in the capital, which was placed in rail- 
way communication with Cape Town in 1893 and with Lourenco 
Marques and Durban in 1895. To Pretoria Dr Jameson and his 
troopers were brought prisoners (January 1896) after the fight at 
Doornkop (to be handed over in a few days to the British govern- 
ment), and thither also were brought the Reform Committee 
prisoners from Johannesburg. In May 1900 Kruger fled from 
the town, which on the 5th of June surrendered without re- 
sistance to Lord Roberts, despite its formidable encircling forts, 
which however were never effectively armed. On the 31st of 
May 1902 the articles of peace whereby the Boer leaders re- 
cognized British sovereignty were signed at Pretoria, and five 
years later there assembled in the capital the first parliament 
of the Transvaal as a self-governing state of the British Empire. 
On the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910 
Pretoria became its administrative capital, the seat of the legis- 
lature being however at Cape Town. The Transvaal parlia- 
ment was replaced by a Provincial Council (see Transvaal: 
§ History). 

The town' is governed by a municipality, which since 1903 
has acquired control of the sanitary service, water supply, 
electric fighting and tramways. In 1909 the proportional 
representation system was adopted for the election of town 
councillors. 

PRETORIUS, the family name of two of the early leaders of 
the " Trek " Boers— Andries Wilhelmus Jacobus Pretorius 
and Marthinus Wessels Pretorius, father and son. 

1. Andries Pretorius (1799-1853), a Dutch farmer of 
Graaff-Reinet, Cape Colony, and a descendant from one of the 
earliest Dutch settlers in South Africa, left his home in the Great

Trek, and by way of what is now the Orange Free State crossed 
the Drakensberg into Natal, where he arrived in November 
1838, at a time when the emigrants there were without a re- 
cognized leader. Pretorius was at once chosen commandant- 
general and speedily collected a force to avenge the massacre 
of Piet Retief and his party, who had been treacherously killed 
by the Zulu king Dingaan the previous February. Pretorius's 
force v/as attacked on the 16th of December (" Dingaan's Day ") 
by over 10,000 Zulus, who were beaten off with a loss of 3000 
men. In January 1840 Pretorius with a commando of 400 
burghers helped Mpande in his revolt against his brother Dingaan 
and was the leader of the Natal Boers in their opposition to 
the British. In 1842 he besieged the small British garrison 
at Durban, but retreated to Maritzburg on the arrival of re- 
inforcements under Colonel (subsequently Sir) Josias Cloete 
and afterwards exerted his influence with the Boers in favour 
of coming to terms with the British. He remained in Natal as 
a British subject, and in 1847 was chosen by the Dutch farmers 
there to lay before the governor of Cape Colony the grievances 
under which they laboured owing to the constant immigration 
of natives, to whom locations were assigned to the detriment 
of Boer claims. Pretorius went to Grahams Town, where Sir 
Henry Pottinger (the governor) then was; but Sir Henry re- 
fused to see him or receive any communication from him. 
Pretorius returned to Natal determined to abandon his farm and 
once more trek beyond the British dominions. With a con- 
siderable following he was preparing to cross the Drakensb 
when Sir* Harry Smith, newly appointed governor of the Cape, 
reached the emigrants' camp on the Tugela (Jan. 1848). Sir 
Harry promised the farmers protection from the natives and 
persuaded many of the party to remain, but Pretorius departed, 
and on the proclamation of British sovereignty up to the Vaal 
fixed his residence in the Magalisberg, north of that river. He 
was chosen by the burghers living on both banks of the Vaal 
as their commandant-general. At the request of the Boers at 
Winburg Pretorius crossed the Vaal in July and led the anti- 
British party in their " war of freedom," occupying Bloem- 
fontein on the 20th of the same month. In August he was de- 
feated at Boomplaats by Sir Harry Smith and thereupon re- 
treated north of the Vaal, where he became leader of one of the 
largest of the parties into which the trans- Vaal Boers were 
divided, and commandant-general of Potchefstroom and Rust- 
enburg, his principal rival being Commandant-General A. H. 
Potgieter. In 1851 he was asked by the Boer malcontents in 
the Orange River Sovereignty and by the Basuto chief Moshesh 
to come to their aid, and he announced his intention of crossing 
the Vaal to " restore order " in the Sovereignty. His object, 
however, was rathet to obtain from the British an acknowledg- 
ment of the independence of the Transvaal Boers. The British 
cabinet having decided on a policy of abandonment, the pro- 
posal of Pretorius was entertained. A reward of £2000 which 
had been offered for his apprehension after the Boomplaats 
fight, was withdrawn,, Pretorius met the British commissioners 
at a farm near the Sand River, and with them concluded the 
convention (Jan. 17, 1852) by which the independence of the 
Transvaal Boers was recognized by Great Britain. Pretorius 
recrossed the Vaal and at Rustenburg on the 16th of March was 
reconciled to Potgieter, the followers of both leaders approving 
the convention, though the Potgieter party was not represented 
at the Sand River. In the same year Pretorius paid a visit to 
Durban with the object of opening up trade between Natal and 
the new republic He also in 1852 attempted to close the road 
tc the interior through Bechuanaland and sent a commando to 
the western border against Sechele. During this expedition 
David Livingstone's house at Kolobeng was looted. Pretorius 
died at his home at Magalisberg on the 23rd of July 1853. He 
is described by Theal as " the ablest leader and most perfect 
representative of the Emigrant Farmers." In 1855 a new dis- 
trict and a new town were formed out of the Potchefstroom and 
Rustenburg districts and named Pretoria in honour of the late 
commandant-general. 

2. Marthinius Pretorius (1819-1901), the eldest son of 



Andrics, was appointed in August 1853 to succeed his father as 
commandant-general of Potchefstroom and Rustenburg, two 
of the districts into which the Transvaal was then divided. In 
1854 he led his burghers against a chief named Makapan, who 
had murdered a party of twenty-three Boers, including ten 
women and children. The natives were blockaded in a great 
cave in the Zoutpansberg and about 3000 were starved to death 
or shot as they attempted to escape. Having thus chastised 
Makapan 's clan, Pretorius turned his energies to the creation of a 
strong central government, and from 1856 onward his dominating 
idea appears to have been the formation of one Boer state to 
include the Orange River burghers. In December 1856 repre- 
sentatives of the districts of Potchefstroom, Rustenburg and 
Pretoria met and drew up a constitution and on the 6th of 
January the "South African Republic" was formally constituted, 
Pretorius having been elected president on the previous day. 
Though the Boers of the Lydenburg, Utrecht and Zoutpans- 
berg districts refused to acknowledge the new republic, Pretorius, 
with the active co-operation of Commandant Paul Kruger (after- 
wards President Kruger), endeavoured (1857) to bring about 
the union of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, and a 
commando crossed the Vaal to support Pretorius. The attempt 
at coercion failed, but in December 1859 the partisans of Pre- 
torius in the Free State secured his election as president .of that 
republic. Pretorius had just effected a reconciliation of the 
Lydenburg Boers with those of the other districts of the Trans- 
vaal, and hoping to complete his work of unification he accepted 
the presidency of the Free State, assuming office at Bloemfon- 
tein in February i860. But the condition of anarchy into 
which the Transvaal fell shortly afterwards effectually weaned 
the Free State burghers from any thought of immediate amal- 
gamation with their northern neighbours. Pretorius however 
continued to intervene in the affairs of the Transvaal and at 
length (April 15, 1863) resigned his Free State presidency. 
Acting as mediator between the various Transvaal parties Pre- 
torius in January 1864 succeeded in putting an end to the civil 
strife and in May following once more became president of the 
South African Republic — now for the first time a united com- 
munity. Conciliation was a marked feature of his character 
and to Pretorius more than any other man was due the welding 
of the Transvaal Boers into one nation. Pretorius shared the 
ideas of his father and the Emigrant Farmers generally con- 
cerning the title of the state to indefinite expansion north, east 
and west. Although he had much difficulty in maintaining 
the authority of the republic over the natives within its recog- 
nized borders, yet in April 1868, on the report of gold discoveries 
at Tati, he issued a proclamation annexing to the Transvaal on 
the west the whole of Bechuanaland and on the east territory 
up to and including part of Delagoa Bay. As to Delagoa Bay 
Portugal at once protested and in 1869 its right to the bay was 
acknowledged by Pretorius, who in the same year was re-elected 
president. The right of the Boers to the whole of Bechuana- 
land was not pressed by Pretorius in the face of British op- 
position, but in 1870, when the discovery of diamonds along the 
lower Vaal had led to the establishment of many diggers' camps, 
an attempt was made to enforce the claims of the Transvaal to 
that district. Pretorius aroused the hostility of the diggers by 
granting an exclusive concession to one firm. Realizing his 
mistake, the concession was cancelled and in September 1870 
he issued a proclamation notable as offering to the diggers very 
large powers of self-government. Pretorius went to the western 
frontier and in repeated conferences with the Bechuana chiefs 
attempted to get them to acknowledge the Boer contention and 
by joining the Transvaal to " save " their territory from the 
British. His diplomacy failed, and finally, without consulting his 
colleagues, he agreed to refer the question of the boundary to 
the arbitration of Mr R. W. Keate, then lieutenant-governor 
of Natal. The award, given on the 17th of October 1871, 
was against the Boer claims. Pretorius loyally accepted the 
decision, but it aroused a storm of indignation in the Transvaal. 
The Volksraad refused to ratify the award and Pretorius 
resigned the presidency (November 1871).

From this time Prctorius took little further part in public 
affairs until after the first annexation of the state by Great 
Britain. In 1878 he acted as chairman of the committee of Boer 
leaders who were seeking the restoration of the independence of 
their country, and for his action in that capacity he was arrested 
in January 1880 by order of Sir Garnet Wolscley on a charge 
of treason. (See the Blue Book [C. 2584] of 1880 for details 
of this charge.) He was admitted to bail and shortly afterwards 
urged by Wolseley to accept a scat on the executive council. 
This offer Pretorius declined, but he consented to tour the 
country with a proclamation by Wolseley counselling the Boers 
to submit, and promising them self-government. In December 
of the same year he was appointed, with Paul Kruger and P. 
Joubert, to carry on the government on the part of the insurgent 
Boers. He was one of- the signatories to the Pretoria Conven- 
tion and continued to act as a member of the Triumvirate until 
the election of Kruger as president in May 1883. He then with- 
drew from public life; but lived to see the country re-annexed 
to Great Britain, dying at Potchefstroom on the 19th of May 
1901. He is stated to have disapproved the later developments 
of Krugerism, and within four months of his death visited Louis 
Botha and Schalk Burger, on behalf of Lord Kitchener, with 
the object of bringing the war to an end. 

For the elder Pretorius see G. M. Theal, Compendium of the 
History and Geography of South Africa, 3rd ed. (London, 1878), 
and History of South Africa, vol. iv. (1834-1854] (London, 1893). 
For the younger Pretorius see vol. v. of the same series. 

PRETTY, a word usually applied in the sense of pleasing in 
appearance, without connoting those qualities which are 
described as beautiful or handsome. In Old English praettig 
meant tricky, cunning or wily, and is thus used to translate 
the Latin sagax, astutus, callidus/m a vocabulary of about 1000. 
Praett meant a trick, and this word is seen in many forms in 
Dutch, cf. the* words prettig, sportive, part, trick. A connexion 
has been suggested with the Greek 7rpaKT«c6s, itpkrretv, to do, 
make, through Latin practice, practice, performance; but the New 
English Dictionary rejects these, as also Celtic sources, as un- 
founded. From " cunning " to skilful, and thence to its use as 
a term of general appreciation as is so often used by Pepys, 
the development is easy. 

PREVARICATION, a divergence from the truth, equivoca- 
tion, quibbling, a want of plain-dealing or straightforwardness, 
especially a deliberate misrepresentation by evasive answers, 
often used as a less offensive synonym for a lie. The Latin 
praevaricatio was specifically applied to the conduct in an 
action at law in which an advocate (praevaricator) in collusion 
with his opponent put up a bad case of defence. Praevari- 
care meant literally to walk with the legs very wide apart, to 
straddle, hence to walk crookedly, to stray from the direct road, 
varicus, straddling, being derived from varus, bow-legged, a 
word which has been connected etymologically with German 
quer, transverse, across, and English "queer." 

PREVEZA, or Prevesa, a seaport of Albania, European 
Turkey, in the vilayet of Iannina; at the entrance to the Gulf 
of Arta, an inlet of the Ionian Sea. Pop. (1905), 6500, of whom 
about four-fifths are Christian Albanians or Greeks, and one- 
fifth Moslems. The town is surrounded by dense olive groves, 
and most of its houses stand in their own gardens. The har- 
bour is small, and closed to large vessels by a bar of sand; but 
it is a port of call for the Austrian Lloyd steamers, and 
annually accommodates about 1500 small vessels, the majority 
of which are engaged in the coasting trade. Prcvcza exports 
dairy produce, valonia, hides and wool, olives and olive oil. 
The yearly value of its trade varies from about £70,000 to £80,000. 
About 3 m. north are the ruins of Nicopolis (q.v.). 

PRfiVOST, ANTOINE FRANCOIS (1697-1763), French author 
and novelist, was born at Hcsdin, Artois, on the 1st of April 
1697. He first appears with the full name of Prevost d'Exilcs 
in a letter to the booksellers of Amsterdam in 173 1. His father, 
Lievin Prevost, was a lawyer, and several members of the family 
had embraced the ecclesiastical estate. PreVost was educated 
at the Jesuit school of Hesdin, and in 1713 became a novice of 



the order in Paris, pursuing his studies at the same time at the 
college of La Flechc. At the end of 17 16 he left the Jesuits to 
join the army, but he soon tired of life in barracks, and returned 
to Paris in 1719 with the idea, apparently, of resuming his 
novitiate. He is said to have travelled in Holland about this 
time; in any case he returned to the army, this time with a 
commission. Some of his biographers have assumed that he 
suffered some of the misfortunes assigned to his hero Des Grieux. 
However that may be, he joined in 17 10-1720 the learned com- 
munity of the Benedictines of St Maur, with whom he found 
refuge, he himself says, after the unlucky termination of a love 
affair. He took the vows at Jumieges in 1721 after a year's 
novitiate, and received in 1726 priest's orders at St Germer 
de Flaix. He resided for seven years in various houses of the 
order, teaching, preaching and studying. In 1728 he was at the 
abbey of St Germain-des-Pres, Paris, where he was engaged on 
the Gallia Christiana, the learned work undertaken by the monks 
in continuation of the works of Denys de Saintc-Marthe, who 
had been a member of their order. His restless spirit made 
him seek from the Pope a transfer to the easier rule of Cluny; 
but without waiting for the brief, he left the abbey without 
leave (1728), and, learning that his superiors had obtained a 
lettre de cachet against him, fled to England. 

In London he acquired considerable knowledge of English history 
and literature, traceable throughout his^ writings. Before leaving 
the Benedictines Prevost had begun his most famous romance, 
Mtmcires et avantures d'un homme de qualitS aui s'est retire" du monde, 
the first four volumes of whieh were published in Paris in 1728, 
and two years later at Amsterdam. In 172Q he left England for 
Holland, where he began to publish (Utrecht, 1730) a romance, 
the material of which, at least, had been gathered in London — he 
Philosophe anglois, ou Histoire de Monsieur Cleveland, fits naturel 
de Cromwell, icrite par lui-mesme, et traduite de Vanglois (Paris 
r 73 I-I 739> 8 vols., but most of the existing sets are partly Paris 
and partly Utrecht). A spurious fifth volume (Utrecht, 1734) 
contained attacks on the Jesuits, and an English translation of 
the whole appeared in 1734. Meanwhile, during his residence at 
the Hague, he engaged on a translation of the Historia of De Thou, 
and, relying on the popularity of his first book, published at Amster- 
dam a Suite in three volumes, forming volumes v., vi., and vii. of 
the original Mdmoires^ et avantures d'un homme de quality. The 
seventh volume contained the famous Manon Lescaut, separately 
published in Paris in 1731 as Les Aventures du chevalier des Grieux 

et de Manon Lescaut, par Monsieur D The book was eagerly 

read, chiefly in pirated copies, as it was forbidden in France. In 
1733 he left the Hague for London in company with a lady whose 
character, as given by PreVost 's enemies, was far from desirable. 
In London he edited a weekly gazette on the model of Addison's 
Spectator, Le Pour et contre, which he continued to produce, with 
snort intervals, until 1740. 

In the autumn of 1734 PreVost was reconciled with the Bene- 
dictines, and, returning to France, was received in the Bene- 
dictine monastery of La Croix-Saint-Leufroy in the diocese of 
Evreux to pass through a new, though brief, novitiate. In 
1735 he was dispensed from residence in a monastery by 
becoming almoner to the prince de Conti, and in 1754 obtained 
the priory of St Georges de Gesnes. He continued to pro- 
duce novels and translations from the English, and, with the 
exception of a brief exile (1 741-1742) spent in Brussels and 
Frankfort, he resided for the most part at Chantilly until his 
death, which took place suddenly while he was walking in the 
neighbouring woods on the 23rd of December 1763. Hideous 
particulars have been added, but the cause of his death, the 
rupture of an aneurism, has been definitely established. Stories 
of crime and disaster were related of Prevost by his enemies, and 
diligently repeated, but they have proved to be as apocryphal t 
as the details given of his death. 

Manon Lescaut, one of the greatest novels of the century, is very 
short; it is entirely free from improbable incident, it is penetrated 
by the truest and most cunningly managed feeling; and almost 
every one of its characters is a triumph of that analytic portraiture 
which is the secret of the modern novel. The chevalier des Grieux, 
the hero, is probably the most perfect example of the carrying 
out of the sentiment " All for love and the world well lost " that 
exists in fiction, at least where the circumstances are those of ordinary 
and probable life. Tiberge, his friend, is hardly inferior in the 
difficult part of mentor and reasonable man. Lescaut, the heroine's 
brother, has vigorous touches as a bully and Bohemian; but the 
triumph of- the book is Manon herself. Animated by a real affection

for her lover, and false to him only because herlove of splendour, 
comfort and luxury prevents her from welcoming privation with 
him or for him, though in effect she prefers him to allothers, perfectly 
natural and even amiable in her degradation, and yet showing the 
moral of that degradation most vividly, Manon is one of the most 
remarkable heroines in all fiction. She had no literary ancestress; 
she seems to have sprung entirely from the imagination, or perhaps 
the sympathetic observation, of the wandering scholar who drew 
her. Only the Princesse de Cleves can challenge comparison with 
her before or near to her own date, and in Manon Lescaut the 
plot is much more complete and interesting, the sentiments less 
artificial, and the whole story nearer to actual life than in 
Madame de la Fayette's masterpiece. Prevost's other works 
include: Le Doyen de Killirine, histoire morale, composie sur les 
mimoires d'une illustre famille d' Ireland (Paris, 1735; 2nd part, 
the Hague, 1730, 3rd, 4th and 5th parts, 1740); Tout pour Vamour 
(i735)i a translation of Dryden's tragedy; Histoire aune Grecque

PROVOST, CONSTANT (1787-1856), French geologist, was 
born in Paris on the 4th of June 1787, and was son of Louis 
Prevost, receiver of the rentes of that city. He was educated 
at the Central Schools, where, inspired by the lectures of G. 
Cuvier, Alexandre Brongniart and A. Dumeril, he determined 
to devote himself to natural science. He took his degree in 
Letters and Sciences in 181 1, and for a time pursued the study 
of medicine and anatomy. Mainly through the influence of 
Brongniart he turned his attention to geology, and during the 
years 1816-1819 made a special study of the Vienna Basin where 
he pointed out for the first time the presence of Tertiary 
strata like those of the Paris Basin, but including a series of 
later date. His next work (1S21) was an essay on the geology 
of parts of Normandy, with special reference to the Secondary 
strata, which be compared with those of England. From 182 1- 
1829 he was professor of geology at the Athenaeum at Paris, 
and he took a leading part with Ami Bou6, G. P. Deshayes and 
Jules Desnoyers in the founding of the Geological Society of 
France (1830). In 1831 be became assistant professor and after- 
wards honorary professor of geology to the faculty of sciences. 
Having studied the volcanoes of Italy and Auvergne, he 
opposed the views of von Buch regarding craters of elevation, 
maintaining that the cones were due to the material succes- 
sively errupted. Like Lyell he advocated a study of the causes 
or forces now in action in order to illustrate the past. One of 
his more important memoirs was De la Chronologie des terrains 
et du synckronisme des formations (1845). He died in Paris 
on the 17th of August 1856.

PRfiVOST, EUGENE MARCEL (1862- ), French novelist, 
was born in Paris on the 1st of May 1862. He was educated 
at Jesuit schools in Bordeaux and Paris, entering the ficole 
Polytechnique in 1882. He published a story in the Clairon 
as early as 188 1, but for some years after the completion of 
his studies he applied his technical knowledge to the manu- 
facture of tobacco. He published in succession, Le Scorpion 
(1887), Chonckette (1888), Mademoiselle Jauffre (1889), Cousine 
Laura (1890), La Confession d'un amant (1891), Lettres defemmes 
(1892), UAutomne djune femme (1893), and in 1894 he made a 
great sensation by an exaggerated and revolting study of the 
results of Parisian education and Parisian society on young 



girls, Les Demi-vierges, which was dramatized and produced 
with great success at the Gymnase on the 21st of May 1895. 
Le Jardin secret appeared in 1897; and in 1900 Les Vierges 
fortes, and a study of the question of women's education and 
independence in .two novels Frederique and Lia. UHeureux 
minage (1901), Les Lettres a Franqoise (1902), La Princesse 
oVErminge (1904), and UAccordeur aveugle (1905) are among his 
later novels. An amusing picture of modern German manners 
is given in his Monsieur et Madame M clock (1906). He had a 
great success in 1904 with a four act play La Plusfaible, produced 
at the Comedie Francaise. In 1909 be was elected to the 
Academy. 

PROVOST, PIERRE (1751-1839), Swiss philosopher and 
physicist, son of a Protestant clergyman in Geneva, was born 
in that city on the 3rd of March 1751, and was educated for a 
clerical career. But he forsook it for law, and this too he quickly 
deserted to devote himself to education and to travelling. He 
became intimate with J. J. Rousseau, and, a little later, with 
Dugald Stewart, having previously distinguished himself as a 
translator of and commentator on Euripides. Frederick II. 
of Prussia secured him in 1780 as professor of philosophy, and 
made him memher of the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Ber- 
lin. He there became acquainted with Lagrange, and was thus 
led to turn his attention to physical science. After some years 
spent on political economy and on the principles of the fine 
arts (in connexion with which he wrote, for the Berlin Memoirs, 
a remarkable dissertation, on poetry) he returned to Geneva and 
began his work on magnetism and on heat. Interrupted 
occasionally in his studies by political duties, in which he was 
often called to the front, he remained professor of philosophy 
at Geneva till be was called in 1810 to the chair of physics. 
He died at Geneva on the 8th of April 1839. 

PreVost published muchl on philology, philosophy, and political 
economy; but he will be remembered mainly for having published, 
with additions of his^ own, the Traiti de physique of G. L. Le Sage, 
and for his enunciation of the law of exchange in radiation. ^ His 
scientific publications included De VOrigine des forces magnitiques 
(1788), Recherches physico-micaniques sur la chaleur (1792), and 
Essai sur le calbrique rayonnant (1809). 

PRfiVOST-PARADOL, LUCIEN ANATOLE (1829-1870), 
French man of letters, was born in Paris on the 8th of August 
1829. He was educated at the College Bourbon and entered the 
ficole Normale. In 1855 he was appointed professor of French 
literature at Aix. He held the post, however, barely a year, re- 
signing it to become a leader-writer on the Journal des dibats. He 
also wrote in the Courrier du dimanche, and for a very short 
time in the Tresse. His chief works are Essais de politique et de 
littirature (three series, 1850-1866), and Essais sur les moralistes 
francais (1864). He was, however, rather a journalist than a 
writer of books, and was one of the chief opponents of the empire 
on the side of moderate liberalism. He underwent the usual 
difficulties of a journalist under that regime, and was once im- 
prisoned. In 1865 be was elected an Academician. The ac- 
cession of Smile Ollivier to power was fatal to Prevost-Paradol, 
who apparently believed in the possibility of a liberal empire, 
and consequently accepted the appointment of envoy to the 
United States. This was the signal for the most unmeasured 
attacks on him from the republican party. He had scarcely 
installed himself in his post before the outbreak of war between 
France and Prussia occurred. He shot himself at Washington 
on the nth of July 1870, and died on the 20th. 

PREY (O. Fr. preie, mod. proie, Lat. praeda, booty, from 
prae and the root hed — seen in prehendere, prendere, to grasp), 
booty, spoil, plunder taken in war, by robbery, or other violent 
means; particularly the quarry, the animal killed for food by a 
carnivorous animal; a beast or bird of prey. A particular usage 
for that which is saved from any trial of strength or battle is 
familiar from the Bible (Jer. xxi. 9) " his life shall be unto him 
for a prey." 

PRIAM (Gr. Ilptajuos), in Greek legend, the last king of Troy, 
son of Laomedon and brother of Tithonus. Little is known of 
him before the Trojan War, which broke out when he was ad- 
vanced in years. According to Homer (Iliad, iii. 184) in his

youth he fought on the side of the Phrygians against the Ama- 
zons. He had fifty sons and fifty daughters, and possessed im- 
mense wealth. He appears only twice on the scene of action 
during the war— to make arrangements for the duel between 
Paris and Menelaus, and to beg the body of Hector for burial 
from Achilles, whom he visits in his tent by night. He was said to 
have been slain by Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, during the sack 
of Troy (Virgil, Aencid, ii, 512). See under Troy, on the legends. 
PRIAPEIA, a collection of poems (about eighty in number) 
in various metres on the subject of Priapus. It was compiled 
from literary works and inscriptions on images of the god by 
an unknown editor, who composed the introductory epigram. 
From their style and versification it is evident that the poems 
belong to the best period of Latin literature. Some, however, 
may be interpolations of a later period. They will be found in 
F. Buchelcr's Petronius (1904), L. Muller's Catullus (1870), and 
E. Bahrens, Poetae latini minorts, i. (1879). 

PRIAPULOIDEA, a small group of vermiform marine crea- 
tures; they have been usually placed in the neighbourhood of 
the Gephyrea, but their position is uncertain and it is doubtful 
if they are to be regarded as coelomate animals. They are 
cylindrical worm-like animals, with a median anterior mouth quite 
devoid of any armature or tentacles. The body is ringed, and 
often has circles of spines, which are continued into the slightly 
protrusible pharynx. The alimentary canal is straight, the 
anus terminal, though in Priapulus one or two hollow ventral 
diverticula of the body-wall stretch out behind it. The nervous 
system, composed of a ring and a ventral cord, retains its 
primitive connexion with the ectoderm. 
There are no specialized sense-organs or 
vascular or respiratory systems. There is 
a wide body-cavity, but as this has no 
connexion with the renal or reproductive 
organs it cannot be regarded as a coelom, 
but probably is a blood-space or haemo- 
coel. 

The Priapuloidea are dioecious, and 
their male and female organs, which are 
one with the excretory organs, consist of a 
pairof branching tufts, each of which opens 
to the exterior on one side of the anus. 
•The tips of these tufts enclose a flame- 
cell similar to those found in Platyhel- 
minths, &c, and these probably function 
as excretory organs. As the animals 
become adult, diverticula arise on the 
tubes of these organs, which develop 
either spermatozoa or ova. These pass 
out through the ducts. Nothing is 
known of the development. There are 
three genera: (i.) Priapulus, with the 
species P. caudatus, Lam., of the Arctic 
and Antarctic and neighbouring cold 
seas, and P. bicaudatus, Dan., of the 
Arctic seas; (ii.) Priapuloides australiSy 
southern circumpolar waters; and (iii.) 
Halicryptus, with the species H. spinulosus, v. Sieb., of 
northern seas. They live in the mud, which they eat, in 
comparatively shallow waters up to 50 fathoms.

PRIAPUS, in Greek mythology, son of Dionysus (or Adonis 
or Hermes) and Aphrodite (or Chione). He is unknown to Homer 
and Hesiod. The chief seat of his worship was the coast of the 
Hellespont, especially at Lampsacus, which claimed to be his 
birthplace. Thence his cult extended to Lydia, and by way of 
the islands of Lesbos and Thasos to the whole of Greece (es- 
pecially Argolis), whence it made its way to Italy, together with 
that of Aphrodite. Priapus is the personification of the fruit-

north Atlantic and 
de Guerne, of the 



fulness of nature. Sailors invoked him in distress and fishermen 
prayed to him for success. He gradually came to be regarded 
as the god of sensuality. His symbol was the phallus, an em- 
blem of productivity and a protection against the evil eye. The 
first fruits of the gardens and fields, goats, milk and honey, 
and occasionally asses, were offered to him. He was sometimes 
represented as an old man, with a long beard and large genitals, 
wearing a long Oriental robe and a turban or garland of vine- 
leaves, with fruit and bunches of grapes in his lap. Amongst 
the Romans, rough wooden images, after the manner of the 
hermae, with phallus stained with vermilion, were set up in 
gardens. His image was placed on tombs, as symbolizing the 
doctrine of regeneration and a future life, and his name occurs 
on sepulchral inscriptions. In his hand he carried a bill-hook or 
club, while a reed on his head, shaking backwards and forwards 
in the wind, acted as a scarecrow. 

PRIBILOF ISLANDS (often called the Fur Seal Islands, 
Russian equivalent, " Kotovi "), a group of four islands, part 
of Alaska, lying in Bering Sea in about 56 50' N. and 170 W., 
about 200 m. N. of Unalaska and 200 m. S. of Cape Newenham, 
the nearest point on the mainland. The principal islands are 
St Paul (about 35 sq. m.; 13 m. long, from N.E. to S.W.; max- 
imum width about 6 m.; named from St Peter and St Paul's 
Day, on which it was discovered) and St George (about 27 sq.m.; 
10 m. long, maximum width, 4 m.; probably named after Pri- 
bilof's ship) about 30 m. S.E.; Otter and Walrus islets, the former 
covering about 4 sq. m., and the latter merely a reef covering 
about 64 acres, are near St Paul. In 1907 the native popula- 
tion was 263 — 170 on St Paul and 93 on St George. Only agents 
of the United States or employes of the lessees are permitted 
as residents on the islands. The islands are hilly and vol- 
canic — Bogoslof, a crater on St Paul, is 600 ft. high — without 
harbours, and have a mean annual temperature of about 35*7° F., 
and a rainfall of about 35 in. There arc only two seasons — 
rainy summers lasting from May to October, and dry winters 
from November to April. The flora is restricted to ferns, 
mosses and grasses, though there are some creeping willows and 
small shrubs. The largest seal rookery, containing about 80 % 
of the seals in the Pribilofs, is on St Paul. The seals found here 
are a distinct variety {Callorhinus alascanus) with much better 
fur than that of any other variety. Besides the fur seal there 
are blue and grey foxes (more on St George than on St Paul), 
and on St George Island and on the Walrus reef there are great 
bird rookeries — the breeding places of immense numbers of 
gulls, sea-parrots, auks, cormorants and arries (Lomvia arra). 

The islands were first sighted in 1767 by Joan Synd, and were 
visited in 1786 by Gerasim Pribiloff, who discovered the fur seal 
rookeries for which they became famous. From Russia the 
islands passed with Alaska to the United States in 1867. From 
1870 to 1890 the United States government leased the islands 
to the Alaska Commercial Company. In 1 890-1 910 the North 
American Commercial Company held the monopoly. But the 
industry shrank considerably owing to pelagic sealing. The 
season during which land hunting is allowed on the islands 
includes June, July, September and October. (See also Seal

PRIBRAM, a town of Bohemia, Austria, 39 m. S.W. of Prague 
by rail. Pop. (1900), 13,576, together with the adjoining town- 
ship of Birkenberg, 19,119, almost exclusively Czech. It lies 
in a valley between the hills of Birkenberg and Heiliger Berg, 
and in its neighbourhood are the lead and silver mines which 
belong to the Austrian government and are worked in nine shafts, 
two of which, the Adalbert shaft (3637 ft.) and the Maria shaft, 
(3575 ft.) are the deepest in the world. The mines have been 
worked for several centuries, but their actual prosperity dates 
from 1770, when the sinking of the Adalbert shaft began. They 
yield yearly an average of 80,000 lb of silver and 1900 tons of 
lead. At the top of the Heiliger Berg (1889 ft.) is a church 
with a wonder-working image of the Virgin, which is the chief 
place of pilgrimage in Bohemia.

in 1818. He was educated at Pembroke College, Oxford, of 
which college (after taking a first class in mathematics in 
1840 and gaining the university mathematical scholarship 
in 1842) he became fellow in 1844 and tutor and mathematical 
lecturer in 1845. He at once took a leading position in the 
mathematical teaching of the university, and published trea- 
tises on the Differential calculus (in 1848) and the Infinitesimal 
calculus (4 vols., 1852-1860), which for long were the recognized 
textbooks there. This latter work included the differential 
and integral calculus, the calculus of variations, the theory of 
attractions, and analytical mechanics. In 1853 he was ap- 
pointed Sedleian professor of natural philosophy, resigning it 
in June 1898. His chief public activity at Oxford was in con- 
nexion with the hebdomadal council, and with the Clarendon 
Press, of which he was for many years secretary. He was 
also a curator of the Bodleian Library, an honorary fellow of 
Queen's College, a governor of Winchester College and a visitor 
of Greenwich Observatory. In 1891 he was elected Master of 
Pembroke College, which dignity carried with it a canonry of 
Gloucester Cathedral. He died on the 29th of December 1898. 
See Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (1899). 

PRICE, BONAMY (1807-1888), English political economist, 
was born at St Peter Port, Guernsey, on the 22nd of May 1807. 
He entered at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1825, where he took 
a double first in 1829. From 1830 to 1850 he was an assistant 
master at Rugby school. He then lived for some years in 
London, being engaged in business and literary work, and was 
appointed to serve on various royal commissions. He married 
in 1864. In 1868 he was elected Drummond professor of politi- 
cal economy at Oxford, and was thrice re-elected to the post, 
which he held till his death. In 1883 he was elected an honorary 
fellow of his college. In addition to his professorial work, he 
was in much request as a popular lecturer on political economy. 
He died in London on the 8th of January 1888. His principal 
publications, exclusive of pamphlets, were: The Principles 
of Currency (1869), Currency and Banking (1876), Chapters on 
Practical Political Economy (1878). 

PRICE, RICHARD (1723-1791), English moral and political 
philosopher, son of a dissenting minister, was born on the 23rd 
of February 1723, at Tynton, Glamorganshire. He was educated 
privately and at a dissenting academy in London, and became 
chaplain and companion to a Mr Streatfield at Stoke Newington. 
By the death of Mr Streatfield and of an uncle in 1756 his cir- 
cumstances were considerably improved, and in 1757 he married 
a Miss Sarah Blundell, originally of Belgrave in Leicestershire. 

In 1767 he published a volume of sermons, which gained him 
the acquaintance of Lord Shelburne, an event which had much 
influence in raising his reputation and determining the char- 
acter of his subsequent pursuits. It was, however, as a writer on 
financial and political questions that Price became widely known. 
In 1769, in a letter to Dr Franklin, he wrote some observations 
on the expectation of lives, the increase of mankind, and the 
population of London, which were published in the Philosophical 
Transactions of that year; in May 1770 he communicated to 
the Royal Society a paper on the proper method of calculating 
the values of contingent reversions. The publication of these 
papers is said to have exercised a beneficial influence in draw- 
ing attention to the inadequate calculations on which many 
insurance and benefit societies had recently been formed. In 
1769 Price received the degree of D.D. from the university of 
Glasgow. In 1771 he published his Appeal to the Public on 
the Subject of the National Debt (ed. 1772 and 1774). This 
pamphlet excited considerable controversy, and is supposed to 
have influenced Pitt in re-establishing the sinking fund for the 
extinction of the national debt, which had been created by 
Walpole in 17 16 and abolished in 1733. The means, however, 
which Price proposed for the extinction of the debt are described 
by Lord Overstone 1 as " a sort of hocus-pocus machinery," sup- 
posed to work " without loss to any one," and consequently 
unsound. 

1 Lord Overstone reprinted in 1857, for private circulation, Price's 
and other rare tracts on the national debt, and the sinking fund. 



Price then turned his attention to the question of the American 
colonies. He had from the first been strongly opposed to the 
war, and in 1776 he published a pamphlet entitled Observations 
on Civil Liberty and the Justice and Policy of the War with America. 
Several thousand copies of this work were sold within a few 
days; a cheap edition was soon issued; the pamphlet was ex- 
tolled by one set of politicians and abused by another; amongst 
its critics were Dr Markham, archbishop of York, John Wesley, 
and Edmund Burke; and Price rapidly became one of the best- 
known men in England. He was presented with the freedom of 
the city of London, and it is said that his pamphlet had no in- 
considerable share in determining the Americans to declare their 
independence. A second pamphlet on the war with America, 
the debts of Great Britain, and kindred topics followed in the 
spring of 1777. His name thus became identified with the cause 
of American independence. He was the intimate friend 
of Franklin; he corresponded with Turgot; and in the winter 
of 1778 he was invited by Congress to go to America and assist 
in the financial administration of the states. This offer he 
refused from unwillingness to quit his own country and his 
family connexions. In 1781 he received the degree of D.D. from 
Yale College. 

One of Price's most intimate friends was Dr Priestley, in spite 
of the fact that they took the most opposite views on morals 
and metaphysics. In 1778 appeared a published correspon- 
dence between these two liberal theologians on the subjects 
of materialism and necessity, wherein Price maintains, in opposi- 
tion to Priestley, the free agency of man and the unity and 
immateriality of the human soul. Both Price and Priestley were 
what would now vaguely be called " Unitarians," though they 
occupied respectively the extreme right and the extreme left 
position of that school. Indeed, Price's opinions would seem 
to have been rather Arian than Socinian. 

The pamphlets on the American War made Price famous. 
He preached to crowded congregations, and, when Lord Shel- 
burne acceded to power, not only was he offered the post of 
private secretary to the premier, but it is said that one of the 
paragraphs in the king's speech was suggested by him and even 
inserted in his words. In 1786 Mrs Price died. There were no 
children by the marriage, his own health was failing, and the 
remainder of his life appears to have been clouded by solitude 
and dejection. The progress of the French Revolution alone 
cheered him. On the 19th of April 1791 he died, worn out 
with suffering and disease. 

The # philosophical importance of Price is entirely in the region 
of ethics. The Review of the Principal Questions in Morals (1757* 
3rd ed. revised 1787) contains his whole theory. It nthicat 
is divided into ten chapters, the first of which, though Theory 
a small part of the whole, completes his demonstration 
of ethical theory. The remaining chapters investigate details 
of minor importance, and are especially interesting as showing his 
relation to Butler and Kant (ch. lii. and ch. vii.). The work is pro- 
fessedly a refutation of Hutcheson, but is rather constructive than 
polemical. The theory he propounds is closely allied to that of 
Cudworth, but is interesting mainly in comparison with the sub- 
sequent theories of Kant. 

I. Right and wrong belong to actions in themselves. By this 
he means, not that the ethical value of actions is independent of 
their motive and end (see ch. vi), but rather that it is unaffected by 
consequences, and that it is more or less invariable for intelligent 
beings. 11. This ethical value is perceived by reason or under- 
standing (which, unlike Kant, he does not distinguish), which intui- 
tively recognizes fitness or congruity between actions.^ agents and 
total circumstances. Arguing that ethical judgment isan act of 
discrimination, he endeavours to invalidate the doctrine of the 
moral sense (see Shaftesbury and Hutcheson). Yet, in denying 
the importance of the emotions in moral judgment, he is driven 
back to the admission that right actions must be " grateful " to 
us; that, in fact, moral approbation includes both an act of the under- 
standing and an emotion of the heart. Still it remains true that 
reason alone, in its highest development, would be a sufficient guide. 
In this conclusion he is in close agreement with Kant; reason is 
the arbiter, and right is (1) not a matter of the emotions and (2) not 
relative to imperfect human nature. Price's main point of differ- 
ence with Cudworth is that while Cudworth regards the moral 
criterion as a v6rjfjta or modification of the mind, existing in germ 
and developed by circumstances, Price regards it as acquired from 
the contemplation of actions, but acquired necessarily, immediately, 
intuitively. In his view of disinterested action (ch. iii.) he adqs

nothing to Butler, III. Happiness he regards as the only end, 
conceivable by us/ of divine Providence, but it is a happiness 
wholly dependent upon rectitude. Virtue tends always to happi- 
ness, and in the end must produce it in its perfect form. 

Works. — Besides the above-mentioned, Price wrote an Essay on 
the Population of England (2nd ed., 1780); two Fast-day Sermons, 
published respectively in 1779 and 1781; and Observations on the 
importance of the American Revolution and the means of rendering it 
a benefit to the World (1784). A complete list of his works is given as 
an appendix to Dr Priestley's Funeral Sermon. His views on the 
French Revolution are denounced by Durke inhis Reflections on the 
Revolution in France. Notices of Price's ethical system occur in 
Mackintosh's Progress of Ethical Philosophy, JoufTroy's Introduction 
to Ethics, WhewelPs History of Moral Philosophy in England ; Dain's 
Mental and Moral Sciences. See also Ethics, and T. Fowler's 
monograph on Shaftesbury and Hutcheson. For Price's life see 
memoir by his nephew, William Morgan. (J. M. M.) 

PRICE, the equivalent in money for which a commodity is 
sold or purchased, the value of anything expressed in terms of 
a medium of exchange (see Value and Wealth). The word 
is a doublet of "praise," commendation, eulogy, Lat. laus, and 
" prize," a reward of victory, the ultimate source of which is 
the Lat. pretium; the Aryan root par- } to buy, is seen in 
Skr. pana, wages, reward, Gr. irtirpaaKeiv, to sell, &c. The 
0. Fr. pris, mod. prix i was taken from a Late Latin form 
prccium } and had the various meanings of the English, " price," 
" prize," and " praise "; it was adapted in English as pris or 
prise and was gradually differentiated in form for the different 
meanings; thus " praise " was developed from an earlier verbal 
form prcise or preyse in the 15th century; the original meaning 
survives in " appraise," to set a value to anything, cf. the cur- 
rent meaning of " to prize," to value highly. " Prize," re- 
ward, does not appear as A separate form till the 16th century. 
In " prize-fight," a boxing contest for money, the idea of reward 
seems clear, but the word appears earlier than the form " prize " 
in this sense and means a contest or match, and may be a differ- 
ent word altogether; the New English Diclionary compares the 
Greek use of a6\ov y literally reward, hence contest. " Prize " 
in the sense of that which is captured in war, especially at 
sea, is a distinct word. It comes through the Fr. prise } 
early Romanic presa for prensa } from Lat. praehendere, to 
seize, capture. For the international law on the subject see 
Prize. 

PRICHARD, JAMES COWLES (1786-1848), English phy- 
sician and ethnologist, was born on the nth of February 1786 
at Ross in Herefordshire. His parents were of the Society of 
Friends, and he was educated at home, especially in modern 
languages and general literature. He adopted medicine as a 
profession mainly because of the facilities it offered for anthro- 
pological investigations. He took his M.D. at Edinburgh, 
afterwards reading for a year at Trinity College, Cambridge, 
whence, joining the Church of England, he migrated to St John's 
College, Oxford, aftenvards entering as a gentleman commoner 
at Trinity College, Oxford, but taking no degree in either uni- 
versity. In 1810 he settled at Bristol as a physician, and in 
1 8 13 published his Researches into Ihe Physical Hislory of Man, 
in 2 vols., afterwards extended to 5 vols. The central principle 
of the book is the primitive unity of the human species, acted 
upon by causes which have since divided it into permanent 
varieties or races. The work is dedicated to Blumenbach, whose 
five races of man arc adopted. But where Prichard excelled 
Blumenbach and all his other predecessors was in his grasp 
of the principle that people should be studied by combining 
all available characters. One investigation begun in this work 
requires special mention, the bringing into view of the fact, 
neglected or contradicted by philologists, that the Celtic nations 
arc allied by language with the Slavonian, German and Pelas- 
gian (Greek and Latin), thus forming a fourth European branch 
of the Asiatic stock (which would now be called Indo-European 
or Aryan). His special treatise containing Celtic compared with 
Sanskrit words appeared in 1831 under the title Easlern Origin 
of the Celtic nations. It is remarkable that the essay by Adolphe 
Pictet, Dc VAffiniU des langues celtiques avee le Sanscrit, which 
was crowned by the French Academy and made its author's 
reputation, should have been published in 1837 in evident 



ignorance of the earlier and in some respects stricter inves- 
tigations of Prichard. 

In 1843 Prichard published his Natural History of Man, in 
which he reiterated his belief in the specific unity of man, point- 
ing out that " the same inward and mental nature is to be re- 
cognized in all the races." Prichard may fairly be honoured 
with the title of the founder of the English branch of the sciences 
of anthropology and ethnology. In 181 1 he was appointed 
physician to St Peter's hospital, Bristol, and in 1814 to the 
Bristol infirmary. In 1822 he published Treatise on Diseases of 
the Nervous System (pt. i.), and in 1835 a Treatise on Insanity 
and other Disorders affecting the Mind, In which he advanced the 
theory of the existence of a distinct mental disease, " moral 
insanity." In 1842, following up this suggestion, he published 
On the different forms of Insanity in relation to Jurisprudence 
designed for the use of Persons concerned in Legal Questions • 
regarding Unsoundness of Mind. In 1845 ^ e was made a com- 
missioner in lunacy, and removed to London. He died there 
three years later, on the 23rd of December, of rheumatic fever. 
At the time of his death he was president of the Ethnological 
Society and a fellow of the Royal Society. Among his less 
important works were: A Review of the Doctrine of a Vital 
Principle (1829); On the Treatment of Hemiplegia (183 1); On 
the Extinction of some Varieties of the Human Race (1839); 
Analysis of Egyptian Mythology (1819).

PRIDE, THOMAS (d. 1658), parliamentarian general in the 
English Civil War, is stated to have been brought up by the 
parish of St Bride's, London. Subsequently he was a drayman 
and a brewer. At the beginning of the Civil War he served as 
a captain under the earl of Essex, and was gradually promoted 
to the rank of colonel. He distinguished himself at the battle 
of Preston, and with his regiment took part in the military 
occupation of London in December 1648, which was the first 
step towards bringing the king to trial. The second was the 
expulsion of the Presbyterian and Royalist elements In the 
House of Commons, for which Pride is chiefly remembered. 
This, resolved by the army council and ordered by the lord 
general, Fairfax, was carried out by Colonel Pride's regiment. 
Taking his stand at the entrance of the House of Commons with 
a written list in his hand, he caused the arrest or exclusion of 
the obnoxious members, who were pointed out to him. After 
about a hundred members had been thus dealt with (" Pride's 
Purge "), the mutilated House of Commons proceeded to bring 
the king to trial. Pride was one of the judges of the king and 
signed his death-warrant, appending to his signature a seal 
showing a coat of arms. He commanded an infantry brigade 
under Cromwell at Dunbar and Worcester. He took no con- 
spicuous part in Commonwealth politics,* except in opposing the 
proposal to confer the kingly dignity on Cromwell. He was 
knighted by the Protector in 1656, and was also chosen a mem- 
ber of the new House of Lords. He died at Nonsuch House, 
an estate which he had bought in Surrey, on the 23rd of October 
1658. After the Restoration his body was ordered to be dug 
up and suspended on the gallows at Tyburn along with those 
of Cromwell, Ireton and Bradshaw, though it is said that the 
execution of this sentence was evaded.

Christ Church, Oxford, where he took his degrees in the following 
order: B.A., 1672; M.A., 1675; B.D., 1682; and D.D., 1686. 
His account of the famous Arundel marbles just given to the 
university appeared in 1676. In 1679 he was appointed to the 
rectory of St Clement's, Oxford, and Hebrew lecturer at Christ 
Church, where he continued until February 1686, holding for 
the last three years the rectory of Bladon with Woodstock. 
In 1686 he exchanged for the benefice of Saham in Norfolk. 
The sympathies of Prideaux inclined to Low Churchism in 
religion and to Whiggism in politics, and he took an active part 
in the controversies of the day, publishing the following pamph- 
lets: " The Validity of the Orders of the Church of England " 
(1688), "Letter to a Friend on the Present Convocation" 
(1690), "The Case of Clandestine Marriages stated" (1691). 
Prideaux was promoted to the archdeaconry of Suffolk in Decem- 
ber 1688, and to the deanery of Norwich (he had long been one 
of the canons) in June 1702. In 1694 he was obliged, through 
ill health, to resign the rectory of Saham, and after having 
held the vicarage of Trowse for fourteen years (1696-1710) 
he found himself incapacitated from further parochial duty. 
He died at Norwich on the 1st of November 1724. 

Many of the dean's writings were of considerable value. His 
Life of Mahomet (1697) was really a polemical tract against the 
deists and has now no biographical value. Both it and his Directions 
to Churchwardens (1701) passed through several editions. Even 
greater success attended The Old and New Testament connected in 
the History of the Jews (1716), a work which not only displayed 
but stimulated research. Biographical details of his numerous 
publications and of his manuscripts are given in the Bibliotheca 
Cornubiensis, ii. 527-533, and iii. 13 19. A volume of his letters to 
John Ellis, some time under-secretary of state, was edited by 
E. M. Thompson for the Camden Society in 1875; they contain a 
vivid picture of Oxford life after the Restoration. An anonymous 
life (probably by Thomas Birch) appeared in 1748; it was mainly 
compiled from information furnished by Prideaux's son Edmund, 

PRIE, JEANNE AGNES BERTHELOT DE PL^NEUF, 

Marquise de (1698-1727), French adventuress, was the 
daughter of a rich but unscrupulous father and an immoral 
mother. At the age of fifteen she was married to Louis, marquis 
de Prie, and went with him to the court of Savoy at Turin, 
where he was ambassador. She was twenty-one when she 
returned to France, and was soon the declared mistress of Louis 
Henri, due de Bourbon. During his ministry (1723-1725) she 
was in several respects the real ruler of France, her most notable 
triumph being the marriage of Louis XV. to Marie Leszczynska 
instead of to Mile de Vermandois. But when, in 1725, she 
sought to have Bourbon's rival Fleury exiled, her ascendancy 
came to an end. After Fleury's recall and the banishment of 
Bourbon to Chantilly Mme de Prie was exiled to Courbepine, 
where she committed suicide the next year. 
See M. H. Thirion, Madame de Prie (Paris, 1905). 

PRIE-DIEU, literally "pray God," strictly a prayer desk, 
primarily intended for private use, but often found in churches 
of the European continent. It is a small ornamental wooden 
desk furnished with a sloping shelf for books, and a cushioned 
kneeling piece. It appears not to have received its present 
name until the early part of the 17th century. At that period 
in France a small room or oratory was sometimes known by 
the same name. A similar form of chair, in domestic furniture, 
is called prie-dieu by analogy. 

PRIEGO DE CORDOBA, a town of southern Spain in the 
extreme S.E. of the province of Cordova, near the headwaters 
of the river Guadajoz, and on the northern slope of the Sierra de 
Priego. Pop. (1900), 16,902. The district abounds in cattle and 
mules and agricultural products, especially wine and oil. The 
local industries also include tanning and manufactures of esparto 
fabrics, rugs and cotton goods. The oldest church was built 
in the 13th century and subsequently restored; it has a fine 
chapel. There are ruins of an old castle — Priego having been a 
fortified city of the Moors which was captured by the Christians 
in 1226, lost again, and finally retaken in 1407. 

PRIENE (mod. Samsun kale), an ancient city of Ionia on the 
foot-hills of Mycale, about 6 m. N. of the Maeander. It was 



formerly on the sea coast, but now lies some miles inland. It is 
said to have been founded by Ionians under Aegyptus, a son of 
Neleus. Sacked by Ardys of Lydia, it revived and attained 
great prosperity under its " sage," Bias, in the middle of the 6th 
century. Cyrus captured it in 545; but it was able to send 
twelve ships to join the Ionian revolt (500-494). Disputes 
with Samos, and the troubles after. Alexander's death, brought 
Priene low, and Rome had to save it from the kings of Pergamum 
and Cappadocia in 155. Orophernes, the rebellious brother of 
the Cappadocian king, who had deposited a treasure there and 
recovered it by Roman intervention, restored the temple of 
Athena as a thankoffering. Under Roman and Byzantine 
dominion Priene had a prosperous history. It passed into 
Moslem hands late in the 13th century. The ruins, which lie 
on successive terraces, were the object of missions sent out 
by the English Society of Dilettanti in 1765 and 1868, and have 
been thoroughly laid open by Dr Th. Wiegand (1895-1899) for 
the Berlin Museum. The city, as rebuilt in the 4th and 3rd 
centuries, was laid out on a rectangular scheme. It faced south, 
its acropolis rising nearly 700 ft. behind it. The whole area was 
enclosed by a wall 7 ft. thick with towers at intervals and three 
principal gates. On the lower slopes of the acropolis was a shrine 
of Demeter. The town had six main streets, about 20 ft. wide, 
running east and west and fifteen streets about 10 ft. wide 
crossing at right angles, all being evenly spaced; and it was thus 
divided into about 80 insulae. Private houses were apportioned 
four to an insula. The systems of water-supply and drainage 
can easily be discerned. The houses present many analogies 
with the earliest Pompeian. In the western half of the city, on a 
high terrace north of the main street and approached by a fine 
stairway, was the temple of Athena Polias, a hexastyleperipterial 
Ionic structure built by Pythias, the architect of the Mausoleum. 
Under the basis of the statue of Athena were found in 1870 
silver tetradrachms of Orophernes, and some jewelry, probably 
deposited at the time of the Cappadocian restoration. Fronting 
the main street is a series of halls, and on the other side is the fine 
market place. The municipal buildings, Roman gymnasium, 
and well preserved theatre lie to the north, but, like all the other 
public structures, in the centre of the plan. Temples of 
Isis and Asclepius have been laid bare. At the lowest point 
on the south, within the walls, was the large stadium, con- 
nected with a gymnasium of Hellenistic times.

PRIEST (Ger. Priester, Fr. prUre), the contracted form of 
" presbyter " (-irpeGpvTepos, " elder "; see Presbyter), a name 
of office in the early Christian Church, already mentioned in the 
New Testament. But in the English Bible the presbyters of 
the New Testament are called " elders," not " priests "; the latter 
name is reserved for ministers of pre-Christian religions, the 
Semitic W& (koh&nim, sing, kohen) and D '1P? (kemarim), 
or the Greek kpets. The reason of this will appear more clearly 
in the sequel; it is enough to observe at present that, before our 
English word was formed, the original idea of a presbyter had 
been overlaid with others derived from pre-Christian priest- 
hoods, so that it is from these and not from the etymological 
force of the word that we must start in* considering historically 
what a priest is. The theologians of the Greek and Latin 
churches expressly found the conception of a Christian priest- 
hood on the hierarchy of the Jewish temple, while the names 
by which the sacerdotal character is expressed — Upevs, sacerdos 
-r-originally designated the ministers of sacred things in Greek 
and Roman heathenism, and then came to be used as transla- 
tions into Greek and Latin of the Hebrew kohen. ' Kohen , Upebs, 
sacerdos , are, in fact, fair translations of one another; they all 
denote a minister whose stated business was to perform, on 
behalf of the community, certain public ritual acts, particularly 
sacrifices, directed godwards. Such ministers or priests existed 
in all the great religions of ancient civilization. The term 



PRIEST 



3i7 



" priest " is sometimes taken to include " sorcerer," but this 
use is open to criticism* and may produce confusion. 

The close inter-relation which existed in primitive society 
between magic, priesthood and kingship has been indicated by 
Frazer in his Early History of the Kingship. His remarks throw 
some light on the early character of priesthood as well as king- 
ship. " When once a special class of sorcerers has been segre- 
gated from the community and entrusted by it with the dis- 
charge of duties on which the public safety and welfare arc 
believed to depend, these men gradually rise to wealth and 
power till their leaders blossom out into sacred kings." Ac- 
cording to Frazer 's view, " as time goes on the fallacy of magic 
becomes more and more apparent and is slowly displaced by 
religion; in other words the magician gives way to the priest. 
Hence the king starting as a magician tends gradually to 
exchange the practice of magic for the functions of prayer and 
sacrifice." We are not concerned here with the debatable 
question whether magic preceded religion. Probably magic 
was always accompanied by some primitive form of animism 
whether the Melanesian mana or fetishism (see Dr Haddon's 
Magic and Fetishism, pp. 58-62, 64-90). 

The investigations which have been carried on in recent years 
by King, Tallquist and Zimmern, as well as by Brttnnow and 
Craig, on the magic and ritual of Babylonia and Assyria have 
been fruitful of results. The question, however, remains to 
be settled how far the officials and their functions, which in the 
much more highly developed civilization of Babylonia came* to 
be differentiated and specialized, can be strictly included 
under the functions of priesthood. The answer to this question 
will be in many cases negative or affirmative according to 
our strict adherence or the reverse to the definition of the 
priest set forth above as " a minister whose stated business it 
was to perform on behalf of the community certain ritual acts, 
in some cases sacrifices (or the recitation of prayers), directed 
Godwards." On the other hand the seer, diviner and prophet 
is a minister whose function it is to communicate God's will 
or word to man. This is not a distinction which governs 
Zimmern and other writers. Our chief source of information 
is Zimmern's Beitr'dge zur Kenntniss der Babylon: Religion, 
pp. 81-95, from which Lagrange in his £tudes sur les religions 
similiques 2 has chiefly derived his materials (ch. vi. p. 222 sqq.) 
respecting Babylonia and Assyria. Zimmern's results arc 
summarized in K.A.T Z . p. 589 sqq. Here we find magic and 
soothsaying closely intert
