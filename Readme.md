Books - Encylopedia Britannica
==============================

An online copy of the eleventh edition of Encyclopedia Britannica,
originally published around 1911, and therefore in the public domain
in most territories.

For all of the first sixteen volumes, and part of the seventeenth,
these files are adapted from sources on the Project Gutenberg website,
though all Project Gutenberg references and licensing information has been
removed, in accordance with the terms of their license.

However, Project Gutenberg's collection stops partway through volume 17.
After that, there are some scans on Internet Archive, with above-average
but still very inaccurate OCR.  For example, volume 18 can be viewed at the URL

	https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabri18chisrich

It may be possible to correct the OCR mistakes in the Internet Archive versions
by referencing the PDF files containing the scanned images of the original pages,
but, as each volume contains around a thousand pages, that is unlikely to happen soon.
In the near term, editing efforts may focus on merely delimiting the individual articles
with two blank lines so as to make the articles more machine-readable, so that they can
be used as the basis for an online version of the encyclopedia.


Content
-------

Be warned that this is an encyclopedia from 1911.  Many articles put forth with
supreme confidence opinions that are, to most modern readers, deeply objectionable,
along with facts that are, frankly, incorrect.  It is recommended that these articles
be read with skepticism, disdain, and pity, as appropriate.
